/* THE PREVIEW IS AN IFRAME, ON PURPOSE.
 *
 * The kit's responsive rules are Tailwind breakpoints — `sm:`/`md:`/`lg:` —
 * and those answer to the VIEWPORT, not to a container. A phone preview drawn
 * in a 390px box inside a desktop page would still be laid out as a desktop,
 * which is the wrong answer dressed as the right one. An iframe is its own
 * viewport, so a 390px frame IS a phone to every breakpoint the kit wrote.
 *
 * The frame is `about:blank` written by this document, so it is same-origin:
 * React renders straight into it through a portal, and the kit's compiled CSS
 * (fonts inlined) is copied in once. The one thing this costs: a Radix
 * overlay (a Select's list, a Popover) portals to the OUTER document's body,
 * so a dropdown opened inside the preview lands at the wrong offset. The
 * preview is for layout at two widths; the drop-downs work in the app. */

/* THE PAGE'S OWN GUTTER, WHICH THE PREVIEW USED TO SPEND NOTHING ON.
 *
 * The owner, 5 September 2026: "There is no correct padding on mobile
 * screens, desktop screens, etc." He is right and the cause was literal — the
 * frame wrote `body{margin:0}` and dropped the parts straight against the
 * viewport edge, at BOTH widths, so a desktop preview and a phone preview
 * had the same padding as each other and it was zero. A part flush to the
 * glass is not what any screen in either front door looks like.
 *
 * The two numbers are the kit's own, taken from the token scale's own
 * comments rather than chosen here: `--space-7` is annotated "page pad" and
 * `--space-5` is annotated "side padding, narrow". A phone gets the narrow
 * one, a desktop gets the page one. Nothing is invented and nothing is a
 * pixel value.
 *
 * THE BLOCK GAP BETWEEN PARTS IS THE THIRD NUMBER and it belongs here for the
 * same reason: `--space-6` is annotated "card inset, panel inset", which is
 * the measure a page of stacked panels breathes at. It used to be
 * `--space-3` — a control gap — which is why a stack of five parts read as
 * one dense block. */
