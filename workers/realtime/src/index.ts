// TWO Durable Object classes. TeamChannel (addressed "team:<id>#0…N-1", one
// object per SHARD of a team) holds open WebSocket connections and fans out
// tiny "X changed" pings; TeamInterest (one per team) remembers which shards
// hold listeners for which resources, so a ping visits only the shards that
// care. (This header said "ONE Durable Object per team" for a year after the
// second class shipped — the file's own Env declared both the whole time.)
// Connections are accepted with the Hibernation API, so an idle team's object is
// evicted from memory while its sockets stay open — idle teams cost ~nothing.
// It stores NO application data; the databases remain the single source of truth.
//
//   GET  /api/realtime?team=<id>   (WebSocket upgrade) -> join a team's channel
//   POST /publish  { channel, event }                  -> broadcast (service-binding only)
//   GET  /api/realtime/health
//
// Reusable as-is by any app built on the kwapso base — it knows nothing about
// what "members" or "member_roles" mean; it just relays opaque resource tags.

 * HOW LONG ONE AUTHORIZATION MAY STAND — the deadline on a live socket.
 *
 * The gate in `handle()` runs ONCE, at the handshake: signed in, an ACTIVE
 * member of this team, and — for a client login — the fence they stand behind.
 * The answer is serialized onto the socket so that no later ping costs a
 * database read. What nothing ever re-asked was whether the answer was still
 * true.
 *
 * A hibernatable socket outlives the object that accepted it, and a browser tab
 * is patient, so "once" meant FOREVER. A member removed from the team, and a
 * client login whose portal access was revoked, kept hearing that team's change
 * pings — resource, row id and account, in real time — for as long as they left
 * the connection open. Signing out does not end it either: destroySession
 * clears a cookie and a row and touches no socket, and publishSignOut is wired
 * to the email-change flow on the `user:` channel alone.
 *
 * What that leaks is ids, not rows: the payload carries no content, and every
 * door refuses them the moment they try to read one. This codebase has already
 * ruled on whether that is nothing — it is not. `mayHearChange` exists because
 * "row ids are not secret: the live channel broadcasts them"
 * (shared/workers/account-scope.ts), and a fence that is correct at the
 * handshake and unexamined for ever after is the same sentence said about time
 * instead of about accounts.
 *
 * So an authorization EXPIRES, and the expiry is enforced where the decision is
 * spent: `broadcast` closes an over-age socket instead of sending to it. That
 * shape is deliberate on both counts. It needs no alarm and no list of "things
 * that ought to disconnect somebody" — a list is a thing the next module can be
 * missing from, which is the failure this file's own fence was written to
 * avoid. And it runs exactly when it matters: a channel with nothing to say has
 * nothing to leak, and the first ping after the deadline is the one that does
 * not go out.
 *
 * The client does the rest unaided. shared/web/realtime.ts reconnects with
 * backoff and calls `onReconnect`, so the socket comes back re-gated and the
 * screen resyncs whatever it missed — and a caller who is no longer a member
 * simply gets the 403 the API has been giving them all along. Fifteen minutes
 * is chosen against that cost: one extra handshake per listener per quarter of
 * an hour, against a stale-authorization window that used to have no end.
