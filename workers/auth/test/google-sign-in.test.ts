// GOOGLE SIGN-IN, ADVERSARIALLY.
//
// Google's assertion is the ONLY thing standing between a stranger and a session
// on this path — there is no code to type, no inbox to own. So the suite is
// written from the attacker's side: every test below is a forged, stale or
// misaddressed token that MUST be refused, and only one of them is a token that
// should work.
//
// The tokens are REAL. A 2048-bit RSA key is generated in the suite and used to
// sign genuine JWTs, so the signature check is exercised by actual RSASSA-PKCS1
// verification rather than by a stub agreeing with itself. A second key pair
// plays the forger: same `kid`, different key — which is precisely the token an
// attacker can mint at will, and precisely what the deleted June version of this
// file would have accepted, because it never verified a signature at all.
//
// The last two tests are the OTHER half of the promise: one person, two ways in.
