// TWO WAYS THE IDENTITY DOORS ANSWERED A QUESTION NOBODY WAS ENTITLED TO ASK.
//
// 1 · THE ENUMERATION ORACLE. `verifyEmailChange` re-checked "is this address
//     already taken?" as its FIRST act — before the code row was even looked up,
//     before the attempt cap, before the hash comparison. So any signed-in caller
//     could post {email: "someone@elsewhere.com", code: "000000"} and read the
//     answer off the status: 409 means that address holds an account, 400 means it
//     does not. No code needed, no pending change needed, no counter touched — and
//     this door has no throttle of its own (they all live on .../change/start).
//     In an invite-only product the global `users` table IS the agency's staff and
//     client-contact roster, and `/api/auth/*` is forwarded BY PREFIX at the agency
//     origin, so a client-portal contact reaches it too.
//
//     The fix is an ORDERING, which is why it needs a test that can tell the two
//     orders apart: the uniqueness check now sits AFTER the hash comparison, so it
//     only ever answers someone already holding a live code for that address.
//
// 2 · THE WRONG-TYPED PROFILE FIELD. `POST /api/auth/profile` read its body with a
//     bare cast and handed the whole object to updateProfile, which did
//     `(input.firstName ?? "").trim()`. `??` does not catch a number, so
//     {"firstName": 1} was a TypeError → a 500 → an error_logs row in the GLOBAL
//     core database, from any session, at BOTH front doors. R20's own scanner could
//     not see it: it follows `<binding>.<field>` reads in the file that bound the
//     body, and this door read no fields at all.
//
// Real SQLite, real migrations — the ordering question is about what the database
// is asked and when, so a stub would agree with either order.
