// The login-code doors, source-locked (seam-test style — reads the real code off
// disk). Three security invariants that must never regress:
//   1. A login code appears NOWHERE but the user's inbox — no echo field, no
//      config var that could re-enable one, in any environment. Automated tests
//      sign in through the ADMIN test-login door instead (staging-only secret).
//   2. Every secret-guarded door FAILS CLOSED when its secret is unset.
//   3. The attempt cap is ATOMIC — the limit check and the increment are one
//      statement, so concurrent guesses can't each read a stale count.
