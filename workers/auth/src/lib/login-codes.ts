 * rest stay reserved for the person who asked.
 *
 * WHY: this door is unauthenticated and keyed on an email address alone, so
 * anyone who knows an address can post junk at their code. When the cap was one
 * shared pool, five junk requests killed a freshly minted code and the person who
 * asked for it could not sign in — and sign-in is the only way into the product.
 * A guess is free; an ask costs a send from a throttled budget. So the free thing
 * gets the small lane and the costed thing earns the reserved one.
 *
 * A stranger can still take the reserved lane by ASKING for a code themselves —
 * but that emails a fresh code to the inbox's owner, spends one of the stranger's
 * thirty hourly sends, and is undone the moment the owner asks again. Bounded,
 * costed, and recoverable in under a minute, which the old shared pool was not.
 *
 * The brute-force bound is UNCHANGED: five wrong guesses, whoever makes them,
 * against a 1,000,000-wide code that lives ten minutes. Rotating addresses buys a
 * guesser nothing — the small lane belongs to the CODE, not to each caller.
 * The limits of an address as a name, said out loud: someone behind the same
 * gateway as the person signing in shares their lane, and header-less callers
 * share the "unknown" bucket the same way they share a send budget (see
 * clientIp). Both are the price of the only identifier a pre-sign-in door has. */
