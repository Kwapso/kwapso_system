 *
 * WHY THEY MOVED: the literal was hand-written in three places (this file's
 * pair, plus a third copy in workers/mcp/src/lib/bridge.ts) and the gating
 * seam's sign-in fallback was about to write a fourth — shared code cannot
 * import from a worker, so it had nothing to reach for. During the legacy
 * migration below, a copy that is not updated does not break on the day it is
 * wrong: it keeps working until the estate drains and then stops finding
 * sessions, green build and nothing to point at.
 *
 * RE-EXPORTED so every call site in this worker keeps its habitual import, and
 * so auth still reads as the place the session is decided. Auth remains the only
 * thing that MINTS, SLIDES or DESTROYS one — what moved is a name and two pure
 * functions. `shared/workers/test/session-cookie.test.ts` fails the build if a
 * fourth copy of the literal appears anywhere. */
