  // with awaits between them, so a hundred simultaneous requests all read "none
  // this hour" and all sent. A read-then-write throttle is a suggestion under
  // load. The count now rides the INSERT's own WHERE, and SQLite serializes it —
  // one statement, so a burst spends exactly one budget.
  //
  // TWO ceilings, because this door has TWO victims:
  //   • the CALLER's, so one account can't spend the hour;
  //   • the TARGET's, so any number of accounts can't gang up on one inbox.
  // The second is the one that matters here. Unlike every other throttle in this
  // file, the person who receives this mail never asked for it and has no
  // account here — the caller names them. A per-user cap alone bounds what an
  // ACCOUNT spends, and accounts are free to anyone with an inbox of their own.
  //
  // ONE refusal for both, on purpose: "you have asked too often" and "this
  // address has been asked about too often" are different sentences, and telling
  // them apart would say whether someone ELSE is already asking about that
  // address. A throttle must not become an oracle.
