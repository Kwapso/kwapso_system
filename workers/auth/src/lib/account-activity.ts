 * user's own account feed across their devices with no per-call wiring.
 *
 * AND IT IS CAPPED PER PERSON. This is a write into the SHARED core database that
 * an ordinary signed-in session can repeat as fast as it can post: setting your
 * first name to "a", then "b", then "a" again appends a row every time and pings
 * your live channel every time. One tenant filling their own database is their
 * business; this one is everybody's. So the hourly ceiling RIDES THE INSERT
 * (CONCURRENCY.md — a read-then-write ceiling is a suggestion under load: N
 * concurrent renames all read "under the line" and all write).
 *
 * Over the line the row is DROPPED, not the change: the profile edit itself has
 * already happened and must not be undone by its own history note. A dropped row
 * publishes nothing either — a live "something changed" pointing at a row that
 * was never written is a ping the feed can only answer with a hole. */
