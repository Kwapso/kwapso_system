// byte zero, every time, through the worker — and a download interrupted at 90%
// started again at 0%. R2 has supported ranged reads all along; the door simply
// never asked for one.
//
// These read the real function against a stub bucket, because the whole question
// is which bytes and which headers come back — and the wrong answer here is not an
// error, it is a 200 carrying a slice, which is the one reply a player cannot
// detect.

 *
 * IT USED TO ECHO BACK the very object `byteRange` had just built: a clean union
 * carrying only the keys we set. That made every case here a test of our own
 * parser round-tripping through a mirror, and it is why this suite was green
 * while `/media/*` served `content-range: bytes NaN-NaN/2810365` in production —
 * every ranged read, every shape, for as long as ranges have existed here.
 *
 * What R2 really hands back carries ALL THREE KEYS with `undefined` values: it
 * does not say which slice it sent. That was established by measuring staging
 * across four request shapes and reproducing all four exactly against this
 * shape; the one rival hypothesis (accessors on a prototype, which `in` also
 * finds) was ruled out because it leaves the suffix case correct and production
 * had it broken too. `reports` lets a case ask for the other world — a runtime
 * that DOES report a narrowed slice — because the door must still believe one. */
