// WHY WE MEET — one thin legacy table (27 rows) under the `delivery` module.
//
// It had a neighbour until 17 Aug 2026: `programs`, the ten ways the agency runs
// an engagement. The owner ruled that the Delivery method PAGE goes and that its
// enrichment — the mark, the German name, the description and the standard
// length — belongs on the SPRINT TYPE a person actually picks, so the programme
// half of this module moved into the dropdown vocabulary and left the module
// with one table. Nothing was lost; migration 0025 carries every field across.
//
// THE ONE THING WORTH READING TWICE is why a meeting purpose is a record at all,
// when `departments` and `channels` — its neighbours in the same legacy export —
// became dropdown values. A purpose carries a DEPARTMENT. A dropdown row is a
// single label with nowhere to put a second fact, so making the table fit the
// vocabulary seam would have meant dropping the only structure it has. So the
// purpose is a record and its department is the dropdown value: each fact stored
// the way its own shape asks, rather than both bent to fit one seam.
//
// The list is capped (R14): why an agency meets is a settled taxonomy it revises
// a few times a year, not a collection that grows with use.
