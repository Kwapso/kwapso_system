// STORIES AND SPRINTS — what WE DO about a request, and the block of work it was
// sold inside (.plans/BUILD-1 §2 and §3). Locked model rules enforced HERE, on
// the server:
//   • a story HAS a type — Fix, Feature or Change, required on the way in and
//     editable on the Dropdown values screen (CHECKLIST 6.2). This file said the
//     opposite until 17 Aug 2026 ("the ticket carries the type"), and the owner
//     reversed it: the ticket's type says what a CLIENT asked for, and this says
//     what WE are doing about it, which is a different sentence. Nullable in the
//     column and only in the column, because 3,677 stories arrived from the
//     previous system without one;
//   • a story is the ONLY place an assignee lives. A ticket deliberately has
//     none, and the DATE is the sprint's (CHECKLIST 3.15);
//   • A STORY NAMES THE PROCESSES IT CHANGES, or explicitly says it changes none
//     (`changes_no_step`) — checked when it is WRITTEN (CHECKLIST 6.5, Aurora's
//     ts4: the "no process" answer has to be chosen, not left blank). And it
//     cannot CLOSE without naming the step inside one of those maps, or the same
//     tick. Two rules, two moments, one hook: every savings figure hangs off it,
//     and a nullable column filled in retrospectively is a column full of
//     guesses;
//   • the four states are FIXED (open → in progress → in review → done) and two
//     of them are FACTS rather than choices: a timer start moves a story to `in
//     progress` (routes/work-logs.ts), and `in review` is refused while any timer
//     on it is still running or until an explanation is written. The review step
//     is deliberate. The team-editable "Story status" vocabulary is display-only,
//     exactly as it is for a ticket;
//   • drag-rank is the order, as it is on a ticket. There is no priority field
//     and there will not be one.
//
// WHOSE MATERIAL THIS IS. A story is the AGENCY's: its titles, its assignees and
// its dates are the answer to "which staff member is doing the work", which
// SCOPE ch.06 says the portal never shows. Every door in routes/stories.ts opens
// with `refusePortalCaller`, so there is no account fence in this file and there
// must not be one — a fence would imply a client can reach these rows through
// it. What a client sees of a story is a COUNT on their own ticket, and that
// count is served by the ticket door (BUILD-1 §7).

/** EDIT a sprint — what it is called, what kind it is, what it is for, when it

 *
 * The price is the reason this exists. `sold_price_cents` is the revenue half of
 * every margin the money lane computes (lib/work-engine.ts reads it against the
 * hours logged), and it could be set only at the moment a sprint was started —
 * so a sprint agreed before its price was, which is the ordinary order of a
 * conversation with a client, could never be given one.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOOR WILL NOT MOVE, deliberately: the CLIENT and the APP. Both are
 * load-bearing rather than descriptive. The reference a client quotes was minted
 * against this sprint's having a client at all (`nextTeamRef`, team-wide since
 * 2026-08-31 — see shared/workers/refs.ts), and completing this
 * sprint used to cut a version of every process map inside its app (purged in
 * 0051 — versions are cut by hand now) — and re-pointing
 * either after the fact rewrites what an already-published number means. Same
 * ruling as a ticket's account, and for the same reason: if we ever want to move
 * one it is a deliberate feature with a confirm panel, not a quiet field on an
 * edit form. Start a sprint under the right client; correct everything else here.
