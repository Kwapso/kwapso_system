// can see, in one shape, with the shelf carried on every item.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHERE THE RETRIEVAL LANE PLUGS IN
//
// This build's job ends at "the connection exists, is scoped, is permissioned,
// and can read and write". Making Google material ANSWERABLE — chunking it,
// embedding it, keeping it in step — belongs to the knowledge base, and that is
// a different lane's work. The join is here:
//
//   workers/content/src/lib/knowledge-ingest.ts owns the sweep. It walks a list
//   of KINDS (a ticket, an account, an article), reads a bounded slice of each
//   per tick from a cursor, and writes `knowledge_sources` rows. A Google kind is
//   one more entry in that list, and `readGoogleMaterial` below is the read it
//   should call — it already returns the four fields that ingest wants
//   (`title`, `text`, `url`, `updatedAt`) plus the two it MUST respect:
//
//     • `shelf`       — 'private' means this material may only ever answer its
//                       OWNER's question. A source indexed without that
//                       distinction is the failure the design round named
//                       exactly: a colleague asking about a document in YOUR
//                       Drive should be answered "only if you filed it as team
//                       material". Ingest must carry it onto the source row and
//                       the compartment logic must honour it.
//     • `ownerUserId` — whose connection it came through. `private` is
//                       meaningless without it.
//
//   And one thing that lane must NOT do: call this on a schedule with a
//   fabricated guard. Everything here is read with ONE PERSON'S OWN TOKEN, so a
//   sweep has to run per connected person, as that person, or not at all. The
//   knowledge cron's existing guard is deliberately a user id no row can hold
//   (see index.ts) — that guard resolves no connection here, which is the right
//   failure: nothing, rather than somebody's mail under a system account.

 * THE GOOGLE EVENTS THIS APP ALREADY HOLDS AS MEETINGS.

 * on Google's own event id. "Week Planning" was in there 108 times. "Pickleball"

 * meetings sweep files a meeting — title, purpose, who was there, the
 * transcript when there is one, averaging 431 characters. The calendar sweep
 * files the same event straight off Google — a title and a date, averaging
 * THIRTY-FOUR characters.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS WORTH A QUERY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An eighth of the whole knowledge base was a second, thinner copy of something
 * already in it. That is not merely waste: retrieval hands back the passages
 * that match, so a hundred near-identical thirty-four-character titles compete
 * for room with the passages that could actually answer the question. The
 * owner's report was that the assistant's answers were unsatisfactory, and this
 * is the largest single reason found.
 *
 * THE MEETING WINS, always, and it is not close — it is the same event with the
 * work written on it. An event NOT in this set is one nobody made a
 * meeting for, which is exactly the case the calendar lane is for, and it still

/**
 * A SPACE'S MESSAGES, FOLDED INTO CONVERSATIONS.
 *
 * ── WHY A MESSAGE IS THE WRONG UNIT ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Chat was filed one source per message, and a chat message is mostly not a
 * thing anybody can answer from. Read off the owner's own spaces on 20 Aug 2026:
 * "yes!", "working.", "👏👏👏👏👏", "safe journey". Each of those was its own
 * source, its own passage and its own competitor for room in an answer — while
 * the exchange that gave them meaning was scattered across four other sources
 * that retrieval had no reason to return together.
 *
 * Google hands us the grouping for free: every message carries `thread.name`,
 * and nothing had ever read it. A thread is what a person means by "that
 * conversation about the voucher quantity", and it is the unit they would go
 * looking for.
 *
 * ── WHAT A FOLDED THREAD IS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The whole exchange, oldest first, each line attributed to whoever said it, as
 * one body. So a passage that comes back from retrieval carries the question AND
 * the answer AND who gave it — which is the shape the owner asked for ("they
 * don't know who sent what message") and the shape a citation can point at.
 *
 * The thread's OWN id is the source id, so re-reading a space that has gained a
 * reply updates the conversation in place rather than filing a second copy of
 * it — the content hash changes, the source does not multiply. Its timestamp is
 * the LATEST message, because a conversation is as recent as its last reply and
 * the sweep's cursor orders by exactly that.
 *
 * A message Google gives no thread for is its own conversation of one, which is
 * both true and the safe default.

// is never fetched. A thing that was fetched and then discarded has still been
// fetched, and has still passed through this worker's logs and memory on its way
// to being dropped.
