// The TICKETS module — team-wide support tickets + threaded replies, inside the team's
// OWN database. Locked model rules enforced HERE on the server:
//   • status is a FIXED lifecycle the code trusts (new / triaged / in_progress /
//     ready / resolved) — help_type is a cosmetic selectable, never the source of
//     truth (SCOPE ch.07 calls the type an EDITABLE list, so the code never
//     hard-codes the four values it seeds);
//   • the account owns the WORDING until we read it: a client may edit and re-rank
//     their own ticket while `locked_at` is null, and the first staff touch sets it
//     (SCOPE ch.07, "editing and ranking lock at first staff touch");
//   • the list's order IS the drag-rank — there is no priority dropdown and there
//     will not be one;
//   • tickets are team-wide: the My/All tabs are just a creator filter, no
//     row-level privacy (a mention is notify-only — see lib/notify);
//   • resolving stamps the resolver audit block + resolved flag; reopening clears
//     it. Every status move (incl. reopen) is gated purely by help:edit;
//   • the AI agent's first-draft reply is a HOOK (maybeDraftFirstReply) left off
//     until the agent worker exists — a ticket always opens regardless.

 *
 * WHAT A CLIENT SEES, since the owner's ruling of 11 Aug 2026: their COMPANY's
 * questions, not merely their own. The first version of this fence pinned a
 * portal caller to `creator_id = <them>`, and at a real client that made the
 * finance person and the ops person invisible to each other — two people at the
 * same company, each told the other's question does not exist. So the fence is
 * now the ORDINARY account fence (`accountScopeClause`) over the account the
 * ticket was raised for: the company they are standing in, everything nested
 * beneath it, and nothing else. It cannot reach further than the account scope
 * because it IS the account scope — the same clause the accounts list is built
 * from, reading a column instead of a second idea of who the caller is.
 *
 * The agency's own tickets carry NO account, and NULL never matches an IN list,
 * so they stay the agency's. Staff get no clause at all.
 *
 * `tab` is the My/All choice, and it is now a real choice for a client too:
 * "mine" adds `creator_id`, on top of the fence and never instead of it.
 *
 * `table` prefixes the columns for a joined/EXISTS read (the thread fence).
 *
 * Returned as a clause rather than a pre-check so it rides the same WHERE as the
 * page AND the count — a total that didn't pass the same filter would say how
 * many tickets it is refusing to show.
 *
 * NO DEFAULT ANYWHERE BELOW, deliberately. Every reader in this file used to
 * take `portal = false`, which is a fence that fails OPEN when a call site
 * forgets it — and one did: the door that RAISES a ticket answered with the
 * whole team's list, so a client asking a question was handed every other
 * client's. A required parameter turns that miss into a compile error, which is

 * Returns the new reply's id AND THE RAISER'S, which is not tidiness: the route
 * has to email whoever asked the question, and since a client login is no longer
 * SENT the raiser's id (see toTicket) it cannot read one off the ticket it just
