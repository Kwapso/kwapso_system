// STAFF PROFILES — the person behind the member row, and the certificates they
// hold. Two tables, one module, one audience: the team.
//
// WHY IT IS A MODULE AND NOT A PAGE. Six staff rows in the legacy app carry a
// personality profile — strengths, weaknesses, the people they look up to — and
// the reconciliation's recommendation was to leave them behind as "a team page,
// not a system record". The owner overruled it and asked for real storage, and
// the overrule is right for a reason worth writing down: a profile edited by a
// colleague, with no history and no permission behind it, is a page anybody can
// quietly change about somebody else. Here it is a record — audited, gated,
// retired rather than deleted, with its own line in the activity feed.
//
// WHY IT IS ITS OWN PERMISSION and not four more rights on `team_members`: an
// agency can want everyone to see who their colleagues are without everyone
// being able to change who is on the team. Those are different questions and
// they get different switches.
//
// NEVER A CLIENT'S. There is no portal door on this module, and every handler on
// it refuses a portal caller (R21). A client login reading "what this person is
// bad at" is the clearest possible case of the agency's own material.
