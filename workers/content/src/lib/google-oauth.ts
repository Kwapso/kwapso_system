// CONNECTING A GOOGLE ACCOUNT — a different question from signing in with one,
// and therefore a different OAuth app.
//
// Sign-in (workers/auth/src/lib/google.ts) asks Google one thing: who is this
// person? It requests `openid email`, needs no Google review, and keeps nothing
// afterwards — the answer becomes a session and the token is thrown away. That
// file says so in as many words: "Drive/Gmail/Calendar belong to the OTHER OAuth
// app entirely and must never be requested from the sign-in door." This is that
// other app (GOOGLE_CONNECT_CLIENT_ID / _SECRET), and the separation is the
// point: an app that asks for a mailbox goes through Google's review and shows a
// frightening consent screen, and making everybody who just wants to log in walk
// past that screen is how people learn to click through consent screens.
//
// WHAT IS **NOT** DUPLICATED HERE, deliberately: the id_token verifier. Nothing
// on this path is an authentication decision — the person is already signed in,
// through a door that already proved who they are. What we want from Google is a
// LABEL ("connected as ana@…") so somebody with two accounts can tell them
// apart, and the honest way to ask that is to ask Google, with the access token
// it just gave us, over our own TLS connection (`userinfo`). A second JWT
// verifier written from memory beside the real one is exactly the failure
// shared/workers/front-door.ts exists to record: a security control that exists
// twice holds until somebody writes the second copy.
//
// R11 — every call in this file is a bare `fetch` to the internet, so every call
// carries an AbortSignal timeout. A hung Google socket must not hold a worker.

/**
 * THE SCOPES, PER SERVICE — asked for SEPARATELY, which is the whole shape of
 * this feature. Connecting Drive must not quietly hand over a mailbox, so each
 * service is its own consent screen, its own row, and its own disconnect.
 *
 * Each list is the NARROWEST scope that can do the job the owner asked for:
 *   • drive     — `drive.file` reads and writes only files this app created or
 *                 the user explicitly opened to it, plus `drive.readonly` for
 *                 the named folders. (`drive` full scope is not requested: the
 *                 decision was NAMED FOLDERS, not the whole drive, and asking
 *                 for the whole drive and then filtering would make the promise
 *                 a line of our code rather than a fact at Google.)
 *   • gmail     — read, compose (a DRAFT), send, and FILE (labels). Send is a
 *                 separate scope from compose at Google too, which is convenient:
 *                 the switch the owner asked for has a matching seam on the other
 *                 side. `gmail.modify` is the one that costs something and it is
 *                 asked for with open eyes: Gmail has no scope for "labels on a
 *                 message" alone — `gmail.labels` creates and renames labels but
 *                 cannot put one ON anything — so filing a message is `modify` or
 *                 it is nothing. What `modify` adds beyond what we already had is
 *                 the power to move and archive; what it still cannot do is
 *                 delete, which is the line worth keeping.
 *   • calendar  — READ ONLY, and the narrowest read there is. See the essay
 *                 below: this product stopped writing to a calendar on 18 August
 *                 2026, and asking for a scope we cannot use is asking for a
 *                 power somebody has to take on trust.
 *   • chat      — messages in named spaces, and the space list to name them from.
 *
 * `openid email` rides every one so we can label the connection. It costs
 * nothing at the consent screen — the person is choosing an account there anyway.
 *
 * ── THE CALENDAR DOWNGRADE, AND WHY CHANGING THIS STRING IS NOT THE FIX ──────
 *
 * A GRANT AT GOOGLE IS ADDITIVE, PER OAUTH CLIENT. Google does not store "what
 * kwapso asked for last time"; it stores what this person has ever approved for
 * this client id, as a set. So an account that already approved
 * `calendar.events` (read/WRITE) goes on holding it after this list is narrowed,
 * and the next connect returns a token that STILL carries the write scope — a
 * consent screen the person walks past without being asked anything new, and a
 * fix that looks done and is not. It is the failure this file is most able to
 * hide, because nothing about it is visible from inside the app: the code stops
 * calling a write endpoint (it already has), the string here says readonly, and
 * the access token quietly keeps the power.
 *
 * THREE THINGS TOGETHER MAKE THE NARROWING REAL, and no one of them does it
 * alone:
 *
 *   1. DISCONNECT REVOKES AT GOOGLE (`revokeAtGoogle` below, called by
 *      lib/google.ts `disconnect`). Dropping our row stops US using a grant and
 *      does nothing to the grant. Revoking is what empties the set, so the next
 *      consent starts from nothing.
 *   2. CONNECT FORCES A FRESH CONSENT — `prompt=consent` plus
 *      `include_granted_scopes=false` in `buildConnectStart`. The first stops
 *      Google reusing an approval silently; the second stops it minting a token
 *      over the whole previously-granted set.
 *   3. WE READ BACK WHAT GOOGLE ACTUALLY GAVE — the token response's `scope`,
 *      stored on the row and compared against this list by
 *      `unrequestedScopes` below. That is the part that makes the other two
 *      PROVABLE rather than hoped for: if a grant comes back carrying anything
 *      we did not ask for, the person's own settings card says so in words
 *      instead of the app pretending.
 *
 * The order matters to somebody holding an old grant: disconnect first (which
 * revokes), then connect. A connect on top of a live grant is the case step 3
 * exists to catch.

/**
 * THE SCOPES ONE CONSENT ASKS FOR — one service's, or every service's at once.
 *
 * ── WHY "ALL AT ONCE" HAD TO EXIST, and it is a bug fix before it is a feature ──
 *
 * The four services share ONE Google OAuth client, and Google keeps ONE grant per
 * (person, client). A consent therefore REPLACES the grant rather than adding to
 * it — so connecting Gmail silently invalidated the Drive refresh token minted
 * ten minutes earlier, connecting Calendar killed Gmail, and so on round the
 * four. Only the service connected LAST ever worked.
 *
 * Nothing said so. Our four rows each stayed `active` holding a refresh token
 * Google had already thrown away, the settings screen showed four green
 * connections, and every sweep but one failed with `google_access_lost` inside a
 * catch. Measured on the owner's own account on 20 Aug 2026: twelve connection
 * rows accumulated over three days, four marked active, and exactly one — Chat,
 * connected eleven minutes earlier — able to answer a request. That is the whole
 * of "the run scripts are not syncing".
 *
 * ── WHY THE FIX IS THIS AND NOT `include_granted_scopes` ────────────────────
 *
 * Google's own answer to a replaced grant is incremental authorisation:
 * `include_granted_scopes=true` mints the new token over everything this person
 * has ever approved. That would work, and it would cost the property the comment
 * above this table exists to defend — a token minted over "everything ever
 * approved" hands a narrowed connection its old write scope back, and the
 * granted-scope readback stops being an answer and becomes an echo of history.
 *
 * Asking for all four at once needs no incrementality at all. One consent, one
 * grant, nothing to replace — so `include_granted_scopes` stays `false` and the
 * narrowing stays real. The union is spelled from the same table the four lists
 * come from, so a scope added to a service is in the "all" consent by
 * construction and cannot be forgotten here.
 *
 * A person may still connect one service alone; it is the same door with a
 * narrower ask. What they may not do any more is connect two, one after the
 * other, and be told both are live.

 *
 * MEASURED AGAINST ALL FOUR LISTS, NOT THIS SERVICE'S — and that is the whole

 * model rather than a fault, and nothing we could prevent if we wanted to.

 * this app's own behaviour, and the grant is Google's. A refresh token is what
 * is handed over rather than an access token because revoking a refresh token
 * takes its access tokens with it.
 *
 * Best-effort ON PURPOSE, and in the safe direction: our row is deactivated
 * first and is the authority, so a failure here leaves a grant Google still
 * honours but nothing in kwapso can reach — never the reverse. It returns a
 * boolean rather than throwing so the door can say "we've disconnected it here;
 * remove it in your Google account too" instead of failing a disconnect the
 * person asked for. The caller reports that word for word, because a revoke that
 * failed is the case where the next connect starts dirty.
