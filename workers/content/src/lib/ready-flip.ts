// THE TICKET↔STORY TRANSACTION — "closing a story is a transaction with the
// ticket's Ready flip" (.plans/BUILD-1 §2), and the sentence it implements is
// SCOPE ch.07's: a ticket flips to READY when the last of its stories closes.
//
// WHY IT IS ONE CALL AND NOT TWO. The client is watching this. If the last piece
// of work goes done and the request they raised still says "in progress" because
// a second request had not been made yet — or was made and failed — then the
// portal is lying about the thing the portal is FOR. So the flip rides the same
// door as the close, and the route only reaches it when a row actually moved.
//
// WHY "READY" IS NOT "RESOLVED". They are different facts and the difference is
// the whole point of having both: ready means every piece of work is done, and
// resolved means we have TOLD them. Nothing here ever resolves a ticket — a
// person does that, when they send the resolution, which is one of only two
// things in the product that emails a client.
//
// IDEMPOTENT IN TWO PLACES, because there are two ways to arrive twice:
//   • the same close, retried — the story move carries `status <> ?`, so a
//     re-run moves zero rows and the route never calls in here at all;
//   • a ticket already at ready (or resolved) — the predicate below carries
//     `status NOT IN (…)`, so zero rows move, no activity row is written and the
//     route publishes nothing.
// A genuine reopen — somebody pulls the ticket back, adds a story, closes it —
// DOES flip again, and that is correct rather than a leak in "exactly once": the
// promise is that one closing event produces one flip, not that a request may
// only ever be finished once.
