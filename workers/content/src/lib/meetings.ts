// MEETINGS — the conversations we have, with the agenda and the notes kept.
//
// THE RECORD GLIDE THREW AWAY. Its 350 meetings were reconciled into work logs,
// because a work log was the only row that carried a date, a duration and a
// client. That kept the HOURS and lost the MEETING: a work log has no field that
// can answer "what did we agree in March". Two columns here are the whole reason
// this module exists — `agenda` and `notes` — and everything else on the row is
// what makes them findable a year later.
//
// TIME IS STILL A WORK LOG. A meeting that ran ninety minutes is two facts, not
// one: a conversation that happened, and ninety minutes that cost us something.
// Joining them would make either one lie the moment the other is corrected, so
// they are joined by nothing at all — the same reasoning that keeps tasks and
// to-dos in two tables (lib/tasks.ts says it there).
//
// WHY IT PAGES (R14). A meeting is an EVENT: rows accumulate with ordinary use
// and are never curated away, because a cancelled meeting is still an answer to
// "didn't we have a call in March?". Glide's own two years are 350 rows, so a
// hard cap would be a ceiling this collection reaches rather than a bound it
// never touches. Keyset, newest first, exactly like the ticket list.

 * used to tick it, now writes the transcript and the work logs alone — its
 * idempotence never rode the status, it rides `transcript_captured_at IS NULL`,
 * which is why a second import still cannot double anybody's hours.

/** HUNT AGAIN FOR THIS CONVERSATION, and keep whichever document holds more of
 * it.
 *
 * ── WHY A HUNT AND NOT A RE-READ, WHICH IS WHERE THIS FIX WENT WRONG FIRST ──
 *
 * The obvious repair is to re-read the file id already on the row, on the theory
 * that Google keeps writing the document we found. It does not always. Measured
 * on `⏩ Week planning`, 2026-09-07: that entry ran as two Meet sessions, so
 * Gemini wrote TWO notes documents — `…11:00 CEST`, created 09:05:24 and last
 * modified 09:05:27 (three seconds, then abandoned, 4,159 bytes), and
 * `…11:28 CEST`, 1,165,858 bytes, holding the whole hour. The meeting claimed
 * the first. Re-reading it would have returned the same 4,159 bytes for ever and
 * reported success, which is a worse failure than the one it was meant to
 * repair: it looks like a fix and measures like one.
 *
 * So the hunt runs again, under its own power, and everything that makes it
 * trustworthy still applies — `notesCouldBelongTo` still refuses a document
 * written before the meeting, so a re-hunt cannot drift onto last week's notes
 * (the fault `clear-mismatched-transcripts.mjs` exists to undo).
 *
 * ── LONGER, NEVER SHORTER, AND THE PREDICATE RIDES THE UPDATE (R17) ─────────
 *
 * A false start and a real transcript are the same shape — both are readable
 * Google documents with the right title, written after the meeting began — so
 * the only thing that tells them apart is how much of the conversation is in
 * them. LENGTH decides, in SQL, so there is no read-then-write window for a
 * concurrent tick to land in, and a document that has stopped growing moves ZERO
 * rows: no activity line, no ping, nothing said. It is also what stops a read
 * cut short by a timeout replacing an hour with two minutes — this failure
 * running backwards.
 *
 * IT WRITES NO WORK LOGS, and that is why `refreshed` is a separate flag from
 * `captured`. The hours were logged when the transcript was first read; they are
 * the same hours however many times the words are re-read.
 *
 * THE COST IS ONE HUNT, and who pays it is bounded by the caller:
 * `meetingsToTry` only re-offers a meeting inside TRANSCRIPT_SETTLE_HOURS of its
 * own start, and a barren refresh counts against TRANSCRIPT_ATTEMPT_CAP, so a
 * transcript that has settled stops being hunted after eight quiet tries. The
 * manual button ignores both, exactly as it always has. */

/* ------------- the calendar, read into Meetings. ONE WAY -------------------- */
//
// THE DIRECTION IS THE DESIGN, and the owner settled it on 18 August 2026:
//
//   "Just remember we want a one-way sync of whatever is in Google Calendar,
//    including: meeting notes, Google Docs attached to it, attachments,
//    location. All of that should be synced with the link to the meeting for
//    future and past events all the time. Anything in my calendar should be up
//    to date here. That's all."
//
// So Google's calendar is the source and this database is the copy. Nothing below
// writes to a calendar and there is no function left in lib/google-api.ts that
// could. The sweep does three things:
//
//   • CREATES — an entry with no record yet becomes one, including one in the
//     PAST, which is how a freshly connected calendar gets last week's stand-up
//     and therefore last week's transcript. There is no test on WHICH entries
//     qualify beyond "it has not already been called off": his instruction is
//     not a narrower rule, it is the absence of one. (It used to be `if
//     (!event.recurringEventId) continue`, which on his own calendar meant 21
//     recurring rows and 0 one-offs, so a real client meeting read back
//     perfectly from Google and never appeared in the meetings list.)
//   • REFRESHES — every meeting whose entry is in the window has its `google_*`
//     mirror rewritten: the description, the location, the guest list and what
//     each person answered, the organiser, the join link, the attachments (which
//     is where an attached Google Doc lives), the zone, the repeat rule, and the
//     link back to the entry in Google Calendar.
//   • RETIRES — an entry cancelled in Google cancels the meeting here, which is
//     a fact only visible on request (a cancelled instance simply stops being
//     returned, which is indistinguishable from the window having moved past it
//     — hence `showDeleted`).
//
// ── HOW IT REACHES "ANYTHING IN MY CALENDAR" WITHOUT AN UNBOUNDED READ ───────
//
// Two windows, and they are two different jobs.
//
// THE LIVE WINDOW is swept on EVERY call: a fortnight back to four weeks on. It
// is what makes the meetings list current, and the backward half is why transcripts land
// at all — everything interesting about a meeting arrives AFTER it (the
// transcript, the recording, the notes doc somebody attaches walking back to
// their desk), so a sweep that only looked forward saw each meeting exactly once,
// at the moment when the least was known about it.
//
// THE BACKFILL is one SLICE of the wider window per call, from a cursor kept on
// the caller's own calendar connection. It walks FORWARD, monotonically, from
// five years ago to a year ahead. Forward-only is the whole safety of it: a
// single frontier cannot leave a gap behind it, where a pair of frontiers
// crawling outwards from today can and does the first time a slice truncates.
// And when a slice DOES truncate — more entries in ninety days than one bounded
// read will walk — the cursor advances only to the last entry actually read, so
// the next call resumes inside the same slice instead of stepping over the tail.
//
// That is R14 honoured rather than dodged: every call is bounded, and "the whole
// calendar" is reached by repetition rather than by one enormous read. A five-
// year history is about twenty-four slices, so a person who opens Meetings a few
// times has their whole meetings list; and once the cursor reaches the ceiling it simply
// keeps pace with it, a slice at a time, for ever.
//
// WHOSE WORDS WIN. A meeting typed in kwapso keeps kwapso's title, times and
// place; a meeting read IN off a calendar takes Google's. That is `from_calendar`,
// decided once at insert. `notes` is never touched by any sync — it is the one
// column here that only a person writes.
//
// IDEMPOTENT, AND CHEAPLY (R17). Google stamps every entry with `updated`. An
// entry whose stamp has not moved since we last mirrored it is skipped entirely
// — no statement, no activity row, no ping — rather than being compared field by
// field or rewritten identically. That is also exactly the signal this needs:
// attaching a transcript to an event IS an edit of the event, so the one stamp
// that says "look again" is the one that moves when a transcript lands.

/** How far ahead a calendar entry becomes a real record IN THE LIVE WINDOW. Four
 * weeks, so there is a month to prepare (Aurora's tk3). Entries beyond it are

  // busy calendar returns the OLDEST fifty and stops. On a real calendar read while
  // building this — ten entries in two days — fifty events is about a week, so
  // the single-window version would have spent its whole page on the past and
  // never reached tomorrow. Repeating meetings would quietly stop being created,
  // and nothing would report an error: the sweep would succeed, every time,
  // doing half its job.
  //
  // So the past and the future get a page each. They are asking two different
  // questions anyway — what has FINISHED and might have grown a transcript, and
  // what is COMING and might need a record — and giving each its own page is
  // what makes both answers complete.
  //
  // ALL THREE OF THE FIRST READS ASK FOR CANCELLED ENTRIES, because a
  // cancellation is a fact only ever visible on request (see calendarList): with
  // `singleEvents=true` a cancelled instance is not returned at all unless it is
  // asked for, which is indistinguishable from the window having moved past it.
  //
  // THE THIRD IS THE BACKFILL SLICE — one bounded step of the walk that makes
  // "anything in my calendar" true. It is an ordinary window like the other two;
