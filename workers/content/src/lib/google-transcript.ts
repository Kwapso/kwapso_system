// FINDING THE TRANSCRIPT OF A MEETING — three hunts, in order of how much they
// prove, behind one function.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY THREE, AND WHY THIS ORDER
//
// Google files a Meet transcript as an ordinary Google Doc. Where that document
// ENDS UP depends on settings nobody in this agency chose and most people have
// never seen: it may be attached to the calendar entry, it may land in a "Meet
// Recordings" folder in the organiser's Drive, and it is always announced by
// mail. Any one of the three can be the only route that works for a given call,
// which is why a single hunt kept coming back empty and why the owner's sentence
// names all three:
//
//   "The knowledge base should also be able to automatically ingest transcripts
//    attached to any calendar meetings, or any Google Docs, or any emails that
//    come describing that a Google Doc has been created for a particular
//    calendar or particular meeting."
//
// THE ORDER IS AN ORDER OF PROOF, not of convenience:
//
//   1. THE EVENT'S OWN ATTACHMENTS. The strongest by a distance: Google itself
//      put this file on THIS entry. There is no matching, no name to get wrong,
//      no other call it could belong to.
//   2. A SHARED DRIVE FOLDER, by the meeting's title and then its Meet code.
//      Good, and it is a MATCH rather than a fact — two calls called "Weekly"
//      produce two documents called "Weekly - Transcript". The Meet code is the
//      tiebreaker and is why it is tried second rather than not at all.
//
//      IT IS ALSO THE LEAST RELIABLE OF THE THREE, and that was learned by
//      looking rather than guessed. Reading a real account on 2026-08-18, five
//      "Notes by Gemini" documents sat under FIVE DIFFERENT parent folders —
//      Meet does not file them all in one place, so "share the folder your
//      transcripts land in" is advice with no single folder to follow. This
//      route works when somebody has shared the right folder and is silent when
//      they have not, which is precisely why it is not the only one.
//   3. GOOGLE'S OWN NOTICE IN THE MAIL. Last, because it is the most indirect:
//      a robot wrote to say a document exists, and we read the document id out of
//      its body. Narrowly fenced (`googleNoticeQuery`) and narrowed again by the
//      meeting's own words. Confirmed against real mail on 2026-08-18: a share
//      notice from `drive-shares-dm-noreply@google.com` carries the document as
//      a plain `https://docs.google.com/document/d/<id>/edit?usp=sharing` line in
//      its body, and its subject carries the meeting's own title.
//
// EVERY ROUTE STOPS AT THE FIRST HIT and says which route found it. A person
// asking "how do you know that is the transcript of this call" gets a different
// and honest answer for each of the three, and the row keeps the answer.
//
// AND A HIT HAS TO HAVE WORDS IN IT. `found` used to mean "a file whose name
// looks like a transcript exists"; it now means "and we read it". On 2026-08-18
// route 2 resolved a Drive SHORTCUT — same name as the document, different id,
// no content — and filed a transcript of zero characters with a plausible name
// and a working link, while route 1 read the same conversation as 13,128
// characters. Nothing reported a failure, because from every angle except the
// only one that matters the hunt had succeeded.
//
// So the read moved INTO the hunt, and an empty read is not a hit. That buys two
// things beyond honesty: a route that finds an unreadable candidate FALLS
// THROUGH to the next one, which is exactly what should have happened that day
// (route 3 had the real document); and a meeting whose transcript could not be
// read is left unclaimed, so the next sweep tries again instead of recording
// that the call is covered.
//
// NOTHING HERE IS A WIDENING OF THE MODULE'S FENCES. Route 1 reads an event this
// caller can already read. Route 2 searches only folders they NAMED. Route 3
// reads only mail from four Google robots about the caller's own files. A person
// who has shared nothing and connected nothing gets an honest empty answer
// rather than kwapso going looking through their Drive.

 * one occurrence stale. Fuzzy titles failed the same way across different

 * up`, five days older.
 *
 * NOBODY COULD HAVE SEEN IT. The door answered 200, a transcript was present,

 * candidate leaves this route with nothing rather than with something wrong, and
 * route 3 still runs. A missing transcript is a visible absence; a confidently
