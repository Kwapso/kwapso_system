/** A CALENDAR DAY, or nothing, or a refusal.
 *
 * Some of the internal tables carry a date somebody types: when a post went
 * out, when a deliverable was dated. They are DAYS, not
 * instants — nobody publishes at 14:32:07 — so the stored shape is YYYY-MM-DD,
 * and this is the only door into it.
 *
 * IT REFUSES RATHER THAN COERCING, and that is the whole point of writing it
 * down. `new Date("31/12/2026")` is `Invalid Date` in one runtime and a real
 * date in another; `new Date("2026-13-45")` silently rolls over into 2027. A
 * value that is nearly a date is the worst kind of bad data, because it sorts,
 * it renders, and it is wrong — so anything that is not exactly a real calendar
 * day, written the one way, is a clean 400 at the door instead of a row that
 * looks fine until somebody sorts by it.
 *
 * Blank / absent → undefined, so the column stays NULL: "we don't know when"
 * is a real and common answer, and it is not the same as a bad answer.
