// READING THE WORDS OUT OF A FILE THAT IS NOT A TEXT FILE.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY THIS EXISTS, measured rather than assumed.
//
// On 2026-08-20 the owner asked what a shared Drive folder actually grabs. The
// answer, counted off his own indexed data, was worse than anybody thought:
//
//   410 Drive documents indexed
//   191 of them (46%) held UNDER 50 CHARACTERS
//
// A Google Doc is exported as plain text and reads fine. Everything else was
// downloaded raw and decoded as UTF-8 — and a .docx is a ZIP, so the decoder hit
// the first non-text byte and stopped, leaving `PK` and three more characters. A
// .png left eight. The assistant could name those files and could not read a
// word of them, which is a large part of "it does not give me satisfactory
// answers".
//
// PDFs were worse than empty: 26 of them, each about 47,000 characters of
// `%PDF-1.6 /Metadata /OCProperties` — file plumbing, indexed as if it were
// prose, competing with real passages in every search.
//
// ── WHAT THIS DOES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ───────────────────────
//
// Office files are ZIP archives of XML, and a Worker can open them: the ZIP
// format is a directory of entries, and `DecompressionStream("deflate-raw")` is
// in the runtime. So .docx, .xlsx and .pptx are unzipped, the right parts are
// read, and the text between the tags comes out.
//
// A PDF is not a container of text — it is a program that DRAWS text, and doing
// it properly means a font-aware layout engine. What is done here is the honest
// subset: the content streams are inflated and the string literals inside the
// text-showing operators are read. That gets real sentences out of most business
// PDFs (exported decks, invoices, letters) and nothing at all out of a scanned
// one, which has no text in it to find.
//
// AN EMPTY ANSWER IS A RESULT, and the caller must treat it as one. A scan, a
// photo, a video: there are no words in the file, and "" is the truthful answer.
// What must never happen again is the THIRD case — bytes that are not words
// being handed on as if they were.
