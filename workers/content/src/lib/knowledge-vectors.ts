// THE VECTOR STORE — the only file that talks to Vectorize.
//
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY ONE INDEX WITH LABELS, AND NOT ONE INDEX PER RECORD
//
// The owner's picture is a notebook per client, per app, per ticket — "the agent
// already knows what each notebook contains", so it opens the right one instead
// of rummaging through everything. That instinct is right and it is the whole
// design here. What is wrong is the noun: a *notebook* cannot be a database.
//
// A Vectorize index is a PROVISIONED RESOURCE. Creating one is an API call that
// can half-fail, it has to be reconciled with the row it belongs to, it has to
// be torn down when the row is deactivated, and — the killer — a Worker reaches
// an index through a BINDING declared in wrangler.jsonc at deploy time. A ticket
// raised at 11:04 must be answerable at 11:04. It cannot wait for a deploy.
//
// So the notebooks are LABELS on the vectors, not containers around them:
//
//   • the compartment, the account, the app, the ticket, the sprint, the kind
//     and the date ride every chunk as METADATA, each one an indexed field;
//   • "open the client's notebook" is `{ compartment: "account:01J…" }`;
//   • "open this ticket's notebook" is `{ ticket: "01J…" }`;
//   • a brand-new ticket is answerable the instant its first chunk is upserted,
//     with nothing to provision and nothing to deploy.
//
// Same idea, built so it holds. And a label can do something a container cannot:
// answer a question that spans two notebooks (this client AND the agency's own
// process) in ONE search rather than two searches somebody has to merge.
//
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE THREE FENCES, AND WHERE EACH ONE REALLY LIVES
//
// The old design kept vectors in the team's own database and argued — correctly
// — that a per-team database makes tenancy STRUCTURAL, where "one index with a
// team id in the metadata" makes it a filter somebody wrote correctly today.
// That argument has to be answered, not waved at. It is answered three times:
//
//   1. TENANCY IS A PARTITION, NOT A FILTER. Every read and every write here
//      passes `namespace: guard.teamId`. A Vectorize namespace is applied BEFORE
//      the search, and a query may name exactly one — so a query cannot see
//      another namespace's vectors even if every metadata filter were wrong.
//      `namespaceFor` is the one place a namespace is built, and it is built
//      from the guard, never from a request.
//
//   2. THE FENCE IS RE-APPLIED IN SQL ANYWAY. This file returns ids and scores.
//      Nothing else. `returnValues: false` and `returnMetadata: "none"` are not
//      an optimisation, they are the fence: the passages an answer is built from
//      are read back out of the TEAM'S OWN DATABASE, under the caller's own
//      owner clause, with deactivated sources excluded. So the vector store
//      NARROWS and the database DECIDES. A wrong label can cost us a relevant
//      passage; it cannot produce one the caller was not allowed to read.
//
//   3. THE PERSONAL FENCE RIDES THE FILTER TOO, so a private source is not even
//      a candidate: `owner` is the sentinel "team" or a user id, and every query
//      carries `owner: { $in: ["team", <caller>] }`. Belt and braces with (2) —
//      deliberately, because this is the fence that decides whether one member's
//      own mail can appear in a colleague's answer.
//
// (Law R26 pins 1 and 2. `workers/content/test/vector-fence.test.ts` breaks it.)
//
// WHAT WOULD CHANGE OUR MIND: a tenant whose material must live in its own
// region or under its own key — then it needs its own index, and the seam to
// change is this file's `indexFor`, which is today a constant. Or Vectorize
// namespaces ceasing to be a pre-search partition, which would demote (1) to a
// filter and leave only (2) — still safe, but no longer structural.
