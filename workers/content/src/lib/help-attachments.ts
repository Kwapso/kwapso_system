// FILES AND LINKS ON A TICKET (CHECKLIST 5.10) — "several files and several
// links on one ticket, from BOTH front doors".
//
// ONE TABLE FOR BOTH KINDS, deliberately. "Here is the thing I mean" is one act:
// a screenshot and a Loom link are the same sentence in a conversation, and two
// tables would have meant two lists, two counts, two orderings and two ways to be
// wrong about which came first. `kind` decides only how `url` is READ — a key
// inside the shared media bucket, or an address a browser follows.
//
// WHY THE SHARED `MEDIA` BUCKET AND NOT `HELP_MEDIA`. Both gateways already serve
// `/media/*` from `MEDIA` (workers/gateway/src/index.ts, workers/portal-gateway/
// src/index.ts); `HELP_MEDIA` is bound on this worker and served by neither. "From
// both front doors" is the requirement, and a bucket a client's browser cannot
// read the file back out of does not meet it. The alternative was a new route and
// a new binding on two public workers to reach a bucket that would then hold
// exactly what the shared one holds. See EDGE-CASES on capability URLs: the key
// carries a ULID, so it is unguessable, and the fence below is what decides who
// is TOLD the key.
//
// THE FENCE IS THE TICKET'S FENCE, one table along — the same shape
// `threadFence` has: an attachment belongs to a ticket, so "may I see this file?"
// is exactly "may I see this ticket?". Expressed as a subquery so it rides the
// same WHERE as the rows AND the count.
//
// DEACTIVATE, NEVER DELETE. Removing an attachment hides the row; the object
// stays in the bucket and the audit block says who took it off. A client who
// attached the wrong screenshot can take it off their own ticket while the
// wording is still theirs — the same lock that governs the wording, for the same
// reason.
