// THE CROSS-DEVICE SYNC LEASE — the server-side half of "never two of the same
// syncs at once" (see migration 0057_one_control_where_there_were_two for the
// owner's own words and why a per-tab map could never answer this).
//
// A short-lived row, not a flag: a claim that never expired would survive a
// worker killed mid-sweep and lock that act out for good, so every claim is a
// LEASE — it takes the row over the moment it is stale, atomically, in the same
// UPSERT that takes it in the first place (CONCURRENCY.md's rule 1). Two
// concurrent claims can't both win: D1 serializes the write, so the loser's
// `WHERE` clause simply matches nothing and it gets nothing back.
