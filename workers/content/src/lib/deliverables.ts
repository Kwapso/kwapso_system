// WHAT WE HAND OVER (CHECKLIST 8.7) — the handover shelf on one app.
//
// The owner's own definition, listing the kinds: "handover materials / handover
// docs / API documentation / loom or teller reviews / SOPs of how to use the
// app, etc." So a deliverable is a piece of MATERIAL with a kind, a title, a
// date, and something it points at.
//
// IT HANGS OFF AN APP, ALWAYS. `app_id` is NOT NULL and every write resolves the
// app first, which is what makes `account_id` a copy rather than a question: the
// app already knows whose system it is (the ruling is that an app belongs to ONE
// account and cannot be moved), so the fence rides one clause here with no join,
// exactly as it does on `processes` and its three children.
//
// THE MATERIAL IS ONE COLUMN FOR TWO SHAPES — an object we host (a
// /media/internal/… URL the upload door minted) or a link we do not (a Loom
// recording, a Google Doc, an API reference). `help_attachments` gives the
// reason at length and it is the same one here: "here is the thing I mean" is
// ONE act, and two columns would be two lists, two counts, and two ways to be
// wrong about which one is set. A link goes through `safeExternalLink` on the
// way in, so a `javascript:` URL is dropped at the boundary rather than stored
// and clicked.
//
// BOUNDED, NOT PAGED (R14). A handover shelf is CURATED — a few pieces of
// material per system, the way the brand library is a few dozen for the agency —
// not a feed that accumulates. The legacy app carried eight rows across
// twenty-eight apps. So the door answers with the whole shelf under a hard cap
// and its exact total beside it, and there is no cursor to spend.

 * changes who can see a row rather than what it says, and it is deliberately its

 * client is a decision, not a correction, and a decision made by mistake while
 * fixing a typo is the mistake this shape prevents.
 *

 * the UPDATE (`AND visible_to_client_at IS [NOT] NULL`), so sharing something
 * twice moves zero rows, writes no second line of history and sends no second
 * ping. Without it a double-clicked "Show to the client" would tell the record's
 * own history that we shared it twice — and the second timestamp would silently
 * overwrite the first, so the client's screen would start claiming a later
 * sharing date than the one they were actually given.
 *
 * ARCHIVED IS NOT HIDDEN, AND HIDDEN IS NOT ARCHIVED. The two switches are
 * independent columns on purpose: `deactivated_at` is our word about our own
 * shelf, `visible_to_client_at` is theirs. The client's read demands BOTH (live

 * portal without touching the sharing decision — and restoring it puts it back
