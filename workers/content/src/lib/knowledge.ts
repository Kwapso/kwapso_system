// THE KNOWLEDGE BASE — one knowledge base, many compartments, chosen for the
// reader rather than by them.
//
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE ARCHITECTURAL DECISION, written down where the code it governs lives,
// because a decision recorded anywhere else is a decision the next person
// relitigates.
//
// 1. IT IS A MODULE ON `workers/content`, NOT A NINTH WORKER. (Unchanged, and
//    the argument still holds.)
//
//    For: CLAUDE.md's first directive ("a route on an existing worker beats a
//    new worker"), and precedent — content already owns learning and tickets,
//    already reaches the team's own database over the one REST door, already
//    binds R2. A source row is shaped exactly like a learning row.
//
//    Against, and it is a real argument: ingestion is a different shape from
//    everything else here — scheduled, resumable, fanned out over thousands of
//    documents — and `workers/content` is on the CLIENT PORTAL's critical path.
//
//    Decided for the module, on three grounds: ingestion never touches the
//    request path for longer than one bounded slice; the isolation a worker
//    boundary buys is bought more provably by the fence the base already has
//    (every door here refuses a portal caller AT THE DOOR, machine-checked,
//    where "it is on another worker" is a deployment fact no law reads); and a
//    ninth worker is four law SCANS whose worker lists would each have to learn
//    about it, every one a place a new worker is silently un-measured.
//
// 2. THE SEARCH LIVES IN VECTORIZE. THE ANSWER STILL COMES OUT OF THE TEAM'S
//    OWN DATABASE. (This replaced the original decision. Here is why, and what
//    the original got right.)
//
//    WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE, and why it was reasonable: vectors were stored in
//    the team's own D1, and a search was two stages — a lexical narrowing to at
//    most 200 candidate chunks, then a cosine re-rank over exactly those. It
//    kept tenancy structural (a guard resolves one database id and the SQL
//    cannot name another) and it needed no new platform resource. At three
//    thousand chunks it worked.
//
//    WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT, measured rather than assumed. The stages were
//    SERIAL, and the wrong one was first. The meaning stage only ever saw what
//    the word stage handed it, so a question asked in different words from the
//    material could not be answered no matter how good the embedding was — and
//    the "top-up" that was supposed to save it (fill the candidate set with the
//    compartment's newest chunks) is recency, not search. Against seven whole
//    books — 5.5 MB, 7,441 chunks, real embeddings, 142 questions with known
//    answers — the shipped design found the right passage in its top six on
//    46.5% of them. The same corpus, the same embeddings, the same questions,
//    with the two arms run SIDE BY SIDE and fused: see the numbers in
//    .plans/BUILD-4-knowledge-retrieval.md. The prefilter was the ceiling.
//
//    So the fix is not "Vectorize instead of D1". The fix is LEXICAL AND VECTOR
//    AS PEERS, and Vectorize is what makes the vector arm affordable when it can
//    no longer be a re-rank of two hundred rows: an approximate-nearest-neighbour
//    search over every chunk in the compartment, in one call, at any size.
//
//    THE FENCES DID NOT MOVE — see the header of knowledge-vectors.ts for the
//    full argument. In one line: the vector store NARROWS and the database
//    DECIDES. Vectorize is asked for ids and scores only (`returnValues: false`,
//    `returnMetadata: "none"`); every passage in every answer is then read back
//    out of the team's own database, under the caller's own owner clause, with
//    excluded sources gone. A mislabelled vector can cost a relevant passage; it
//    cannot produce one the caller was never allowed to read. Law R26.
//
// 3. THE ROUTER READS THE COVERS FIRST — AND SAYS WHAT IT READ, RATHER THAN
//    QUIETLY RE-ORDERING THE EVIDENCE.
//
//    Every record the base mirrors carries a short written SUMMARY of itself
//    (knowledge-summary.ts), embedded alongside the material at `level:
//    "record"`. A question searches the summaries first. That is the owner's
//    "the agent already knows what each notebook contains", and it is built.
//
//    WHAT THE SUMMARIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO IS RANK THE PASSAGES, and this is
//    the sharpest thing the measurements taught. Two ways of letting a record
//    hint move a chunk were tried on the same corpus:
//      • as a PREFERENCE (lift the chunks of the top three records): recall@6
//        62.7% → 54.2% at book shape, → 14.8% when the same text was re-cut into
//        250 small records;
//      • as a NARROWING (search only inside the top records): → 34.5% (top 1),
//        49.3% (top 3), and 10.6% / 18.3% at record shape.
//    Both are worse, and the second is catastrophic, for the same reason: a
//    router is a GUESS about which notebook, and a guess placed in front of the
//    search can hide the answer completely. The search is very good at finding
//    the passage; it does not need to be told where to look.
//
//    So the summaries inform the ANSWER, not the ranking. The route narrows by
//    COMPARTMENT — which is a fact, not a guess: the caller is standing on a
//    client's record, or the question names one — and the records the summaries
//    matched ride the answer as `records`, so the assistant and the reader can
//    see what this question looks like it is about. Wrong, that is visible and
//    harmless. Wrong as a filter, it is invisible and fatal.
//
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// THREE FENCES, and they are not the same fence — the comment is here because
// conflating any two of them is how this kind of module leaks:
//   • TENANCY   — the team's own database, and the vector index's namespace.
//   • THE CLIENT — `refusePortalCaller`, at every door (R21). The knowledge base
//     holds the agency's internal material; a client login never reaches it.
//   • THE PERSON — `owner_user_id`. Material that arrived through one member's
//     own sight of it is readable only in THEIR answers.
// A COMPARTMENT IS NOT A FENCE. It is relevance: which slice of the team's own
// material answers this question. Every compartment belongs to the same team and
// the same staff readers; narrowing to one is about a better answer, never about
// permission.

 *
 * MEASURED, 27 Aug 2026, and it is the same failure the proportional floor was

 * embedding of the question is essentially the embedding of "3144" and the vector
 * arm finds the right chunks by itself. Put that reference inside a sentence a
 * person would actually say — "could somebody remind me where things currently

 * week?" — and the embedding is dominated by the polite framing, the vector arm
 * returns three FluClinic meetings, and the word arm, which found the right chunk,

/** THE PERSONAL FENCE, as SQL — LIVE against a source's own sightings, not a
 * denormalised copy, because every read that reaches `knowledge_sources`
 * through this function is R14-capped to a handful of rows and
 * `idx_knowledge_sightings_source` (migration 0073) makes the join a keyed
 * lookup rather than a scan. See `fastOwnerClause` below for the one table
 * this reasoning does NOT apply to.
 *
 * THREE BRANCHES, and only TWO of them have a counterpart in
 * knowledge-identity.ts's TS model — SAID PLAINLY because an earlier version
 * of this header claimed all three matched `readableBy` (now `sightingsAdmit`)
 * "exactly", and that sentence was false the moment this function grew a
 * branch the TS side was never given the column to build:
 *
 *   1. `team_visible = 1` — the STORED half of the answer (0075/0076),
 *      recomputed from live sightings by `recomputeTeamVisible` whenever one
 *      changes. Reading it here rather than re-deriving "does a live team
 *      sighting exist" inline is not an optimisation, it is the CONTRACT: this
 *      function and the flag must always agree, and the corpus-wide rot-check
 *      (knowledge-fence.test.ts) is what catches them drifting apart.
 *      MATCHES `teamVisible(sightings)` in knowledge-identity.ts.
 *   2. A source with NO sightings at all answers exactly as it always did:
 *      `owner_user_id IS NULL` is the team's, `owner_user_id = me` is mine — a
 *      typed private note or an uploaded file, which never gets a sighting
 *      because nobody's Google connection produced it. GATED ON
 *      `NOT EXISTS (any sighting for this source)`, and the gate is not
 *      defensive dressing: once a source has sightings, `owner_user_id` is no
 *      longer trustworthy on its own (see `fastOwnerClause` for the reason
 *      that column can end up `NULL` even with no team sighting present), so
 *      an ungated `owner_user_id IS NULL` would read a merely-AMBIGUOUS source
 *      as team-readable — the exact widening this function exists to refuse.
 *      NO TS COUNTERPART. `sightingsAdmit`/`teamVisible` take a `Sighting[]`
 *      and never see `owner_user_id`, so neither one can decide this branch —
 *      not a gap in the model, a question outside what it was ever handed.
 *      Proven correct on its own, against the real door, in
 *      knowledge-fence.test.ts ("a source with no sightings").
 *   3. EXISTS a LIVE sighting that is mine. The branch that answers for
 *      exactly the population this whole design exists to serve: several
 *      people's own sight of one thing, folded into one source, where no
 *      single column could ever have named all of them.
 *      Together with branch 1, MATCHES `sightingsAdmit(sightings, me)` — but
 *      only once a source HAS sightings; see branch 2 for the case it does
 *      not, which sightingsAdmit was never asked about at all.
 *
 * ONE COLUMN CANNOT HOLD A SET is the whole of why this function exists. The
 * old single-line version — `owner_user_id IS NULL OR owner_user_id = me` —
 * read correctly for a source at most one person had ever seen. It cannot
 * read correctly for the calendar fold, where measured on staging every one of
 * 27 doubly-or-triply-sighted events is private, on the private shelf, seen by
 * more than one person: `NULL` there would answer for everybody, and a single
 * saved id would lock the others out. See scripts/measure-source-identity.mjs. */

 * and is untouched by any of this. Once a source has more than one DISTINCT
 * PRIVATE sighter, no single column can name them all, and the honest value
 * for `owner_user_id` on its chunks and terms is `NULL` — read here as "narrow
 * it in for everyone" rather than "nobody restricts it". THAT IS R26'S OWN
 * BARGAIN, one layer down: a wrong label here costs a relevant passage its
 * place in the ranking; it cannot cost a caller an answer they should never
 * have had, because the read-back through `knowledge_sources` — `ownerClause`

/** THE WRITE SIDE OF `team_visible` — SQL TEXT, not a call.
 *
 * Every writer that changes what a source's sightings SAY (a new sighting, a
 * shelf moved private→team, one retired) must recompute `team_visible` on the
 * source and denormalise the same value onto every chunk and posting it owns,
 * in the SAME statement or transaction as that write — never a follow-up call
 * that can be skipped. This function is the exact condition the hub set
 * before any of this could be trusted to store an answer (tick 8): the
 * recompute must be atomic with the write that made it stale, or the gap
 * between them is a window where the flag says one thing and the sightings
 * say another, silently.
 *
 * SO IT RETURNS TEXT RATHER THAN EXECUTING ANYTHING. A separate async call is
 * a separate network round trip a future writer's own `d1ExecScript` can be
 * built without — awaited, forgotten, or raced against the very insert it was
 * meant to follow. Splicing this into THAT SAME script makes "wrote a
 * sighting without recomputing" impossible to construct rather than merely
 * disciplined against; the string is unusable any other way, which is the
 * point.
 *
 * THREE STATEMENTS, ONE COMPUTED VALUE, in SQL rather than round-tripped
 * through this process — `EXISTS(...)` evaluates to SQLite's own 0 or 1, so
 * the three UPDATEs share one true source of truth rather than three chances
 * for a client-computed value to be stale by the time the third statement
 * runs. `gone_at IS NULL` is a LIVE sighting; `shelf = 'team'` is the only
 * shelf this flag ever models — see `ownerClause`'s own header for why the
 * app tier can never ride this column.
 *
 * ── THE ONE THING A CALLER MUST GET RIGHT, SAID EXACTLY: SPLICE ORDER ──────
 *
 * `d1ExecScript` runs the statements in ONE script in the order they are
 * written, and each later statement sees every earlier one's effect — that is
 * the whole reason a script is atomic in the first place. This function's
 * `EXISTS` subqueries read `knowledge_sightings` AS THE SCRIPT STANDS AT THE
 * MOMENT THEY RUN. So:
 *
 *   THE STATEMENT(S) THAT INSERT, UPDATE OR RETIRE A SIGHTING FOR THIS SOURCE
 *   MUST APPEAR EARLIER IN THE SAME SCRIPT STRING THAN THIS FUNCTION'S OUTPUT.
 *
 *       const script = `
 *         INSERT INTO knowledge_sightings (...) VALUES (...);
 *         ${teamVisibleRecomputeSql(sourceId)}
 *       `
 *       await d1ExecScript(cfg, guard.databaseId, script)
 *
 * GET THE ORDER BACKWARDS — recompute text placed BEFORE the sighting write —
 * and the `EXISTS` runs against the sightings table as it stood a moment
 * EARLIER, before the very write that was supposed to make it correct. That
 * produces exactly the staleness this function exists to prevent, self
 * inflicted, inside the one script that was supposed to be atomic against it.
 * A stale-high result from this failure mode never leaks (it only narrows a
 * caller in early, which R26 accepts); a stale-LOW one silently refuses
 * material to everybody it should still answer for, the moment the ordering
 * mistake happens to land on a source's LAST live sighting retiring.
 *
 * Multiple sighting writes for the SAME source in one script — a fold adding
 * one sighter while retiring another — are fine in any order AMONG
 * THEMSELVES, as long as all of them precede this function's text. A caller
 * recomputing with no sighting write in the same script at all (a resync, a
 * repair pass) may splice this anywhere; there is nothing to race against. */

/** ONE SOURCE'S FAILURE IS ONE SOURCE'S — the same sentence the Google readers
 * learnt on 9 Sep 2026, one layer further in, and on a much wider population.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS WRONG ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `indexSource` was awaited at three points in the loop below with NO catch
 * around any of them, so anything it threw for ONE source — a Vectorize upsert
 * refused, a D1 write that would not take that row's text, a sub-request budget
 * reached on an awkward document — escaped the loop, escaped `sweepKind`, and
 * landed in `sweepKinds`' catch, which recorded a fact about one document as the
 * failure of the WHOLE KIND. The tick's remaining sources were never reached,
 * the pass was discarded, and the kind sat red until it next had a completely
 * clean run.
 *
 * `embed()` catches its own model failures, which is why this stayed invisible:
 * the common failure was already handled, so the loop LOOKED protected. It was
 * protected against exactly one thing.
 *
 * ── WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN THE GOOGLE ONE ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The Google fix was about READING from Google, so it reached the four Google
 * lanes. This is the INDEXING step, which every kind goes through — tickets,
 * stories, meetings, processes, people, and every file a person uploads through
 * the app by hand. The owner asked whether the skip-and-continue rule covered
 * the manual uploads too. It did not. It does now, and it covers them by
 * construction rather than by four more copies of a catch.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SWALLOW ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The repair write is NOT wrapped. If the database itself is unreachable, this
 * catch cannot record anything either, and that throw propagates and fails the
 * lane — which is correct: "one document is awkward" and "the database is gone"
 * must not come back as the same sentence, and the second is one somebody has to
 * be told about. The failing case chooses honestly between them without anybody
 * having to enumerate error codes.
 *
 * ── AND IT CANNOT LOOP FOR EVER ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It bumps `embed_attempts`, the counter the loop below ALREADY consults against
 * `EMBED_ATTEMPT_CAP`, so a source that fails repeatably is given up on and
 * reported once, exactly as a repeatably-unembeddable one is — and is picked up
 * again the moment its text changes, because the upsert clears the counter. It
 * also blanks `content_hash`, so a source that threw halfway through is re-read
 * rather than skipped as unchanged.
 *
 * Returns whether the source was indexed, so the caller's count stays true. */

 *
 * `source.owner_user_id ?? TEAM_SHELF` is correct only because `owner_user_id`
 * is trusted, by construction, to name AT MOST ONE PERSON — or nobody, which is

 * DISTINCT PRIVATE sightings into one source (the calendar fold's own shape —
 * measured on staging, every one of its 27 multi-sighted events is private,
 * seen by more than one person, no team sighting), no single value can name
 * them all, and the whoever writes that merge MUST set `owner_user_id = NULL`
 * on the source, DELIBERATELY, rather than leave it at whatever the last
 * ingest reader to run happened to write.
 *
 * GET THIS WRONG AND NOTHING DOWNSTREAM CAN RESCUE IT. `ownerClause`
 * (knowledge.ts, above) decides the real answer from live sightings and cannot

 * colleague's search at THIS layer, before `ownerClause` is ever consulted —
 * a false refusal with no correct read-back to appeal to, because a vector
 * Vectorize never returns as a candidate never reaches it. `NULL` is the only
 * honest value once one column can no longer name the truth: over-inclusive at
 * the narrowing stage (R26's own bargain — a wrong label costs a relevant
 * passage its ranking slot, never a caller an answer they should never have
 * had), and correctly decided, for real, at the read-back through
 * `ownerClause`. This is not written here as documentation of a decision
 * already made — the fold-merge writer that must make it does not exist yet. */

 * exists to fix: an account that exists but has nothing indexed about it yet
 * (a brand-new client, or a team the sweep has not reached) would have NO
 * candidate row at all, so a question naming it correctly would route as
 * "named no client" — the exact silent failure KB-AUDIT.md §4.2 is about,
 * moved rather than fixed. `accounts` and `apps` are foundational tables that
 * exist the moment a record does, independent of indexing, which is what
 * `accountNamedIn`'s ORIGINAL implementation relied on by reading them
 * directly; this keeps that guarantee.
 *
 * `contact`/`person` kinds are left to grow this table later (the migration's
 * own comment names them as in scope) — `nameArm` already has a working,
 * independently-tested route to colleagues (`knowledge_sources kind='person'`
 * directly), so nothing in this build regresses by their absence here.
 *
 * ALIASES ARE DELIBERATELY THIN: an account's own `code` (BERG, HOGO) is the
 * only one generated, because it is DATA the app already holds, not a guess.
 * Misspelling/nickname GENERATION — 0073's own migration comment says that is
 * "Lane C's job, not this table's" — needs a model call this build has not
 * been cleared to spend (BUILD-5 §3 prices it at $0.10, and the lane's cost
 * rule is ask first). A canonical name with no alias is still fully usable:
 * `accountNamedIn`'s multi-token and rare-single-token rules both read it
 * alone, and a client whose accepted name IS a single ordinary word (the
 * audit's own "green"/"solutions" cases) still resolves once it clears the
 * rarity floor — no alias required for either path.
 *
 * A FULL REBUILD, NOT AN UPSERT. The population is a few hundred rows at
 * most (every live account and app this team holds), so deleting and
 * reinserting is simpler than an upsert keyed on `(kind, ref_id, name)` —

 *
 *   "What is replacing the cartesian distance measurement for HOGO?" — REFUSED,
 *   citing nothing. The answer is in the base, in one sentence of the HOGO
 *   September sprint transcript: "integrate the Google Maps API for driving
 *   distance calculations, replacing the current cartesian measurement method".
 *   Re-ask it as "what did we decide about driving distance in the HOGO
 *   September sprint meeting?" and it answers correctly. Same fact, same
 *   source, one phrasing finds it and the other does not — which is exactly
 *   what the owner had been reporting and nobody could reproduce.
 *
 * ALL-OR-NOTHING FAILS ON ONE ABSENT WORD. "HOGO" is in that source's TITLE and
 * not in the sentence, so the chunk holding the answer carried four of five
 * terms and was thrown away.
 *
 * WHY A SHARE AND NOT A RARITY CAP, since rarity was the obvious idea and was
 * measured first: "cartesian" appears in 12 chunks of this base — but "notice"
 * is in 27 and "policy" in 75, so any cap loose enough to admit the first
 * admits the two that caused the parental-leave answer. The word-frequency
 * distribution is a Zipf tail with no break in it (65% of the vocabulary is in
 * three chunks or fewer), so every threshold is fitted to its examples.
 *
 * CO-OCCURRENCE IS THE HONEST DISCRIMINATOR. The parental-leave failure was
 * many chunks each sharing ONE common word. The cartesian case is one chunk
 * holding MOST of the question at once. That is a difference in kind, and it is

 *
 * OVERRULING, the WHOLE question, however long. Measured 27 Aug 2026 on the

 * a question is a coincidence three words wide. The exception is the one thing
 * the word match is genuinely better at, and it is not here — a rare exact token
 * bypasses this floor entirely (see the `rare` clause in `lexicalArm`), which is
 * how "ticket 3144" still reaches its chunk under the strictest of the three.
 *

 * the base can answer clears the VECTOR floor and is `beside`, never either of
 * the other two. Over the twenty questions in scripts/kb-bench.mjs, every one of

 * across a dozen records — the meetings about it, their Gemini notes, the
 * calendar invitations — and lands in 56 chunks, so a cap of 20 excluded it and
 * the fix shipped green while the case it was for still failed.
 *
 * The distribution, over the 6,372 digit-bearing terms in the agency's own base
 * (27 Aug 2026), is why 100 rather than any nearby number:
 *
 *      1-20 chunks   6,321 terms      references, amounts, codes

/** DOES THIS QUESTION NAME ONE OF US? — the NAME ARM (R47's other half).
 *
 * THE FAULT, and it is a different one from anything the other two arms are for.
 * The owner asked staging "what is Alex's full name?" and was refused. The
 * answer was in the base: a source titled "Alexander Stadlmair" whose text says
 * he is also called Alex. Neither arm could reach it, for two different reasons
 * that happen to coincide on exactly this shape of question:
 *
 *   • THE VECTOR ARM. "What is X's full name?" embeds to something dominated by
 *     "full name", and no passage in an agency's material says "full name". The
 *     nearest neighbour was below the floor, correctly — the question is not
 *     ABOUT anything, it is a lookup.
 *   • THE WORD ARM. It runs beside the vector arm only for an EXACT token (a
 *     digit-bearing reference), and "alex" has no digit in it. With the vector
 *     arm empty the word arm may only overrule on a rare exact token, which by
 *     construction this question has none of. So it was silent by design, and
 *     the design was right for every other question.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES A NAME ANSWERABLE AND NOT A GENERAL BOOST. The base knows who its
 * own people are — that is what R47's `person` kind is — so this arm does not
 * guess whether a word is a name. It ASKS: it reads the team's own people (a
 * bounded read, fenced exactly as every other read here is) and fires only when
 * one of the question's terms is a word of somebody's name, or the beginning of
 * one. "alex" begins "alexander"; "full", "name", "leave" and "policy" begin
 * nobody. That is the whole gate, and it is why this cannot repeat the failure
 * the word arm's own header describes: a question about parental leave matches
 * no person, so this arm returns nothing and the refusal stands.
 *
 * A PREFIX, NOT A SUBSTRING, and not a nickname table. A shortening is almost
 * always the front of the name (Alex, Chris, Ana, Chila), and a substring match
 * would put "art" inside "Stuart" and "ana" inside "Johanna" — a wrong person is
 * worse than a miss here, because the answer would look perfectly well-sourced.
 * `nameSpellings` in the sweep writes the same shortenings INTO the material for
 * the word arm to find; this reaches them by the other road, which is why "Alex"
 * works even on a person whose email says nothing useful. */

/** THE LEXICAL ARM. FTS5's own BM25 over `knowledge_chunks_fts` (0073) — one
 * keyed read, fenced by the reader and narrowed by the compartment.
 *
 * REPLACES `knowledge_terms` (KB-AUDIT.md §4.4): that table's scorer was a raw
 * term-frequency SUM with no IDF and no length normalisation — a chunk saying
 * "invoice" five times outscored one that said it once in a five-word note
 * regardless of how common "invoice" is across the corpus — and the audit's
 * "hybrid search costs nine points of recall" finding was measured against
 * that scorer, not against BM25. FTS5's `bm25()` is a real BM25 (term
 * frequency, inverse document frequency, document-length normalisation), so
 * this is now the arm that measurement should have been run against. See
 * `retrieve`'s header for the re-measured RRF weights.
 *
 * SAME SHAPE AS BEFORE, ON PURPOSE. `termFloor`'s proportional floor and the
 * exact-token bypass (`exactTerms`, `EXACT_TERM_MAX_CHUNKS`) are UNCHANGED;
 * only the source of a chunk's term coverage and its relevance number moved.
 * `fuse` never reads `.lex`'s VALUE, only the ARRAY POSITION this function
 * hands back, so nothing downstream had to change to accept a bm25 number in
 * place of a weight sum.
 *
 * ONE TERM, ONE BRANCH. FTS5 has no "how many of these N terms does this row
 * contain" primitive the way a `GROUP BY chunk_id` over a term-postings table
 * did, so `scoped` is a UNION ALL of one `MATCH` per term. Each term is
 * double-quoted in its MATCH string so a token that happens to collide with an
 * FTS5 operator keyword (AND/OR/NOT/NEAR) is still a literal search rather
 * than a syntax error — `tokenise()` already drops the ordinary stopwords that
 * would otherwise raise this, but a quoted term costs nothing and closes the
 * case a future stopword list forgets.
 *
 * THE FENCE IS APPLIED ONCE, on the union's output, not once per branch —
 * per-branch fencing would multiply the fence's own parameters by up to 24
 * terms and blow the budget below for nothing: every branch shares the same
 * owner and compartment.
 *
 * THE PARAMETER BUDGET, same discipline as the ceiling this arm used to
 * document. Worst case is MAX_QUESTION_TERMS (24) terms, every one of them
 * digit-bearing (all 24 "rare"): the branches bind 2 params each (48), the
 * fence binds one owner id plus a handful of compartments, the rare-term
 * filter binds at most 24 more, and the combined MATCH for `bm25()` binds 1 —
 * about 76 against D1's ceiling of 100. Higher than the old arm's 53 because
 * this one binds two params per term-branch instead of one, and still well
 * inside the ceiling MAX_QUESTION_TERMS was chosen to respect.
 *
 * bm25() IS ASCENDING — SQLite's convention is a MORE NEGATIVE number for a
 * BETTER match (measured against this exact table: a chunk repeating both
 * query terms scored more negative than one containing them once each), the
 * opposite of the old `SUM(weight)`. That is why the final `ORDER BY` reads
 * `ASC` where the old one read `DESC`; the array POSITION `fuse` reads is
 * unchanged — the exact bypass still leads, relevance still breaks the tie. */

 * at a tenth of a vote, gated to questions that contain something exact, it is
 * invisible on questions it has nothing to say about and decisive on the ones

 *
 * The measurement above was taken on seven novels, and this file's own note says
 * the retest belongs on the agency's material. It got one, because the owner
 * asked the question that would need it: "the latest news on the flu clinic
 * stripe integration", and got the week before's meeting.
 *
 * THE CASE FOR ADDING A RECENCY TERM GOT WEAKER, NOT STRONGER. The newest source
 * — a transcript from that morning — was ALREADY retrieved, at rank six of six.
 * Nothing was missing from the ranking. What was missing is that the writer was
 * never told when anything was from, or what day it is, so "latest" was a word
 * with no referent. Giving it the dates answers the question with the ranking
 * untouched (see knowledge-compose.ts), and a term here would have put a measured
 * 20/20 at risk to fix something that was not broken.
 *
 * WHAT WOULD REOPEN IT, and it is deliberately a high bar: a question whose
 * newest material is NOT RETRIEVED AT ALL. Not ranked low — absent. Ranked low is
 * the writer's problem and it now has the dates to solve it. If the bench turns
 * up an absent one, start with recency GATED ON INTENT — a term that applies only
 * when the question itself says "latest", "recent", "today" — because that leaves
 * every ordinary question at the behaviour these numbers were measured on.

  // This used to be one condition (`!vector.length`) covering four situations it
  // called identical: no store bound, the question could not be embedded, the
  // material has no vector because it was indexed while the model was down, or
  // nothing in the base cleared the floor. The first three are IGNORANCE — we
  // did not look, so the word match really is everything we have. The fourth is
  // an ANSWER: a semantic search ran over the whole compartment and reported
  // that nothing in it is about this. Treating an answer as ignorance let the
  // word match overturn it, on shared common words, into a confident reply.
  //
  // MEASURED, 27 Aug 2026, over the agency's own material. Asked "what is our
  // parental leave policy and how much notice does it need?" — a policy the base
  // does not hold and nobody has ever written down — the vector arm topped out
  // at 0.451 against a floor of 0.5 and correctly found nothing. The word arm

  // "notice" and "leave", and answered out of a page of Gemini meeting notes.
  // That is precisely the failure R23 exists to prevent, arriving through the
  // one door that was left open for it.
  //
  // So a search that LOOKED and found nothing stands, with one exception, and it
  // is the same exception the word match exists for: a rare exact token. An

  // "the knowledge base has nothing on this".
  //
  // Two ids came out of the vector store and NEITHER was in the database. The
  // source itself is wide open (`owner_user_id` null, `visible_to_app_id` null,
  // compartment `agency`, one live chunk), so no fence dropped them: the ids
  // simply no longer exist. Re-indexing replaces a source's chunks — new rows,
  // new ids — and the store can still answer with the ids of the ones it
  // replaced. R26 is what makes that survivable rather than dangerous: the index
  // NARROWS and the database DECIDES, so a ghost id reads back as no row instead
  // of as somebody else's paragraph. But "no row" was being reported as "nothing
  // to say", which is a different and much worse sentence.
  //
  // So when nothing survives the read, the covers get the last word. Those
  // record ids already cleared the SAME floor in `deriveRoute`, and their chunks
  // are read from D1 by source — rows that exist by construction, because the
  // database is what just handed them over.
  //
  // WHY THIS DOES NOT CONTRADICT THE NOTE ON `records`, which says the router's
  // guess "rides the ANSWER and never the ranking — a wrong guess here is
  // something a reader can disagree with, not something that hid the passage".
  // That rule exists so a wrong guess cannot HIDE a passage. This runs only when
  // there is no passage left to hide; it cannot reorder anything, because there
  // is nothing to reorder. And if the covers found no record over the floor —
  // which is what a question the base has nothing on produces — it does not run,

 *
 * ── HOW ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Best first, taking at most two passages from any set of sources that share a
 * title, and then — only if that left fewer than were asked for — filling the
 * rest from what was skipped, best first again. So diversity is preferred and
 * never PAID for: an answer can still be six passages from one document when
 * one document is genuinely all there is.
 *
 * Deliberately on the TITLE and not the source id: several passages from one
 * long document are a good answer to a question about that document, and
 * capping those would make a fifty-page contract quotable twice. What is being
 * spread is the ANSWER across the things it is about.

 * On the agency's own base, 28 Aug 2026, over the twenty bench questions: 17 of

 * paragraph the same answer had already shown the reader, and ten of the sixteen

 * embeds the Gemini notes, the notes document is indexed again from Drive, and

 * words — so the title cap, which exists to stop one SUBJECT filling an answer,

 * case" against "Recording damage to a vehicle" at 0.78 are two different process
 * maps and both belong in that answer. So the line goes above them.
 *
 * `ENOUGH_TO_COMPARE` is the other half, and it matters more than the ratio. A
 * share computed over a handful of words is noise: a seven-word calendar envelope
 * scored 0.71 against a sixty-word transcript chunk purely because a short set is

  // The title cap is a preference between EQUALS, so a passage it held back comes
  // back the moment the answer would otherwise be short: `capped` is real material
  // this answer does not have, and there is no reason to leave it out.
  //
  // `spent` is not that, and it took a measurement to see it. A passage that says
  // nothing beyond its own title, or that repeats a paragraph already in the
  // answer, cannot make an answer better — the citation list already carries the
  // title, and the reader has already read the words. Padding six slots with those
  // is precisely the two complaints this module was reopened for: references to
  // files that were not important, and the big file it should have touched left
  // untouched underneath them. Five passages that each say something is a better
  // answer than five and an envelope, and there is no length a reader is owed.
  //
  // So it comes back for one reason only: when it is ALL THERE IS. A bare meeting
  // record — "X is a meeting of ours, on 2026-08-19." — is a thin answer and a
  // true one, and the alternative to quoting it is refusing a question the base
  // can genuinely speak to. That case is `kept` and `capped` both empty; it is not

 * 2026: asked to summarise the week recap, the vector arm returned its full
 * hundred nearest neighbours and NINE of them still existed in the database — the
 * other ninety-one are ids of chunks that re-indexing replaced, which R26 makes
 * survivable (a ghost id reads back as no row, never as somebody else's
 * paragraph) and which nothing makes VISIBLE. So the pool a six-passage answer is
 * chosen from is routinely seven or eight rows, three of which are the same
 * paragraph arriving by three roads. Take those away honestly and the answer is
 * four passages — of a ninety-six-chunk transcript that is sitting right there.
 *
 * The index being stale is its own problem and a bigger one; this is what the
 * retrieval can do about it without pretending the duplicates were material.
 *
 * ── WHY THE NEIGHBOURS, AND NOT MORE OF THE DOCUMENT ────────────────────────
 *
 * The chunk that matched is the evidence; the paragraph either side of it is the
 * rest of the same thought, which is exactly what a reader who found the right
 * sentence wants next. Starting from the top of the document instead would spend
 * the freed slots on a transcript's opening — "Hello. I don't think I can hear
 * you." — which is how a top-up makes an answer worse while making it longer.
 *
 * IT CANNOT REACH ANYTHING NEW. Same fence, same columns, and only sources this
 * answer is already built on — so it can widen an answer and can never open one.
 * A question the base refuses has no `ranked` to widen and this does not run.
