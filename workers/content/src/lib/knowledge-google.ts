// GOOGLE MATERIAL, AS KNOWLEDGE SOURCES — the four kinds that make a named Drive
// folder, a named Chat space, scoped mail and the calendar answerable.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY THIS IS A SECOND LIST OF KINDS AND NOT FOUR MORE LINES IN INGEST_KINDS
//
// lib/google-read.ts's header names the one thing this lane must not do: "call
// this on a schedule with a fabricated guard. Everything here is read with ONE
// PERSON'S OWN TOKEN, so a sweep has to run per connected person, as that person,
// or not at all."
//
// A single list would have obeyed that only by ACCIDENT — the cron's guard is a
// user id no row can hold, so `accessTokenFor` would resolve no connection and
// each Google kind would file nothing. Correct, and invisible: a silent no-op
// that looks exactly like "nobody has connected anything", recorded as a clean
// run, for as long as it takes somebody to notice.
//
// So the separation is structural instead. `sweepAll` — the only sweep the
// scheduled handler can call — takes `INGEST_KINDS`, a list this module is not
// in. These kinds are only ever built from a REAL caller's guard, by a door that
// gated on that caller's own `google:read` right. There is no argument the cron
// could pass that reaches them.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS, said plainly: a person's Google material is brought up to date
// when they (or the assistant acting as them) ask kwapso to, not every fifteen
// minutes. That is the honest shape of a per-person token, and it is why the
// sync screen shows a row per person per service rather than one team-wide "last
// run" that would be a different person's answer every time.
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// TWO FIELDS OFF EVERY ITEM DECIDE WHERE IT LANDS:
//   • `shelf`     → `ownerUserId` on the row. 'private' means this material may
//                   only ever answer its OWNER's question, which the knowledge
//                   base already enforces on every read (its `ownerClause`).
//                   'team' means nobody owns it and everyone who may read the
//                   module may be answered from it.
//   • `accountId` → the COMPARTMENT. The client's, or — when it is null — the
//                   agency's own. Decided by the read that fetched the item (the
//                   folder it came out of, the contact it was with), never by
//                   matching a client's name in the text.
//
// ONE SOURCE PER PERSON PER ITEM. `origin_row_id` carries the reader's user id,
// so a file two colleagues have both named lands as two rows. That is
// deliberate: they are two people's SIGHT of it, and each carries its own shelf —
// one of them may have filed it privately. Sharing one row would make the last
// sweep to run decide who else can read somebody's document.

 * ran twice afterwards and brought in ZERO chat messages, while the knowledge
 * base held 73 chat sources with every one of them deactivated. The material was
 * gone and re-sharing did not bring it back.
 *
 * The cursor is why. A lane keeps its place — `v2|2026-08-20T04:16:39|…` — and
 * resumes from it, which is exactly right while a share is CONTINUOUS: nobody
 * wants a re-read of two years of chat every quarter of an hour. But

 * space is genuinely no longer shared) and re-sharing brings the space back
 * while the cursor still points past everything in it. So the lane resumes
 * after the end of material that is no longer there, finds nothing newer, and
 * reports an honest, useless "caught up".
 *
 * SHARING SOMETHING IS THE ONE EVENT THAT MEANS "READ THIS AGAIN". It is rare, a
 * person does it deliberately, and it is the moment they expect the material to
 * appear — so it is the right and only place to give the cursor up. The cost is
 * one re-read of a folder or a space, bounded by the same caps as any other

/**
 * STOP ANSWERING FROM ONE GOOGLE KIND ALTOGETHER, and read it again from the
 * start — what a person's SCOPE change means for material already brought in.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES, said plainly. Scope narrows what is READ, which is the
 * right shape and is the whole design (lib/google.ts's SCOPE essay). But a
 * person who narrows their mail on Tuesday has already had six months of it
 * indexed on Monday, and "that source was never in scope" is false for every
 * one of those rows. A narrowing that only reaches the future is a narrowing
 * that leaves the thing somebody was trying to get rid of exactly where it was.
 *
 * WHY IT IS THIS BLUNT. A `knowledge_sources` row does not record WHICH calendar
 * or WHICH label it came through — the origin id is Google's event or message
 * id and nothing else — so the rows that are now out of scope cannot be
 * identified after the fact. They could be, with a column and a migration and a
 * backfill that would still know nothing about the rows written before it. So
 * the honest move is to let go of the whole kind and let the next sweep bring
 * back exactly what is in scope, which is a computation the code already knows
 * how to do correctly.
 *
 * IT IS THE SAME ARGUMENT `rewindGoogleLane` ALREADY MAKES, in the other
 * direction: sharing something is the one event that means "read this again",
 * because it is rare, deliberate, and the moment a person expects the material
 * to move. Changing scope is its mirror and earns the same treatment. The cost
 * is one re-read and one re-embed of that person's own mail or calendar, paid
 * only when somebody deliberately changes their mind, and the screen says so
 * before they confirm.
 *
 * AND THE THING THAT HOLDS AFTERWARDS IS THE SCOPE, NOT THE RETIREMENT — which
 * is what makes it safe to retire with the MACHINE's hand (`retire` below leaves
 * `deactivator_id` null, so `sweepKind` may revive these rows, and that is
 * deliberate). Everything still in scope is read again on the next tick and
 * comes back. Everything OUT of scope is never read again, so there is nothing
 * for a revival to act on: the sweep cannot revive a row it is never handed.
 *
 * That is the distinction the retirement seam turns on, applied to its mirror. A
 * person's decision is not enforced by a deactivated_at that must survive every
 * future housekeeping pass — it is enforced by the read never happening. A flag
 * can be flipped back by a pass nobody thought about; a read that does not occur
 * cannot be undone.

 *   the meeting says  742htcuo14uqtaa8v9f53lq7ef_20260904T103000Z
 *
 * Same series, same Friday, thirty minutes apart. A recurring occurrence's id
 * is the series id plus the instance's start, so when the standing call MOVES
 * — the Jourfix went from 10:00 to 10:30 — everything Google wrote before the
 * move keeps the old stamp and everything after it carries the new one. Both
 * are Google's, both name the same hour of the same day, and an equality join
 * matches neither to the other.
 *
 * Measured on staging, 9 Sep 2026: 142 event ids on live sources matched no
 * meeting we hold, and 37 of them are exactly this — the call IS in the base,
 * under the other stamp.
 *
 * ── WHY THE WINDOW IS TWELVE HOURS AND NOT "THE NEAREST ONE" ────────────
 *
 * "Resolve an occurrence to the nearest occurrence of its series" was the
 * shape first proposed, and the data refused it: the MEDIAN distance to the
 * nearest occurrence we hold is 112 DAYS, because the calendar sweep fills a
 * recurring series FORWARDS (out to Aug 2027 on staging) while the knowledge
 * base holds artefacts from occurrences behind it. Nearest-match would have
 * hung last August's minutes on next August's meeting — a wrong answer
 * wearing the shape of a right one, which is the more expensive kind.
 *
 * Inside half a day it is the same call by construction: a series cannot have
 * two occurrences twelve hours apart and still be the weekly, daily or
 * fortnightly rhythm these all are. Outside it, this refuses, and 105 sources
 * keep a null — the honest answer, and the one the Meetings backfill question
 * is really about.
 *
 * ── AND IT SELF-HEALS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It runs on every read of every lane, and the upsert writes `event_id` on
 * every pass (COALESCE keeps a value only where the new one is null), so a
 * source read BEFORE its meeting existed is settled by a later tick with no
 * backfill to run and no repair door for anybody to remember. */

  /* ── FOLD_TO_THE_APP_S_OWN_RECORD ─────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * ONE EVENT, ONE RECORD. A single meeting arrives here as up to five sources:
   * the meeting row this app owns, the notes document Gemini leaves in Drive,
   * Google's "Invitation:" mail, an "Accepted:" mail per guest, and the calendar
   * entry. Five titles, one subject — and an answer built from six passages has
   * then told the reader one thing five times, spending four slots a different
   * real source did not get. Measured on staging 1 Sep 2026: 118 of 3,775 live
   * sources, 3.1% of the corpus.
   *
   * THE APP'S OWN RECORD IS CANONICAL, and the two rules say only that:
   *   · a Drive file that IS some meeting's transcript is the same words at a
   *     second address — an ID join on `transcript_file_id`, not a title guess;
   *   · a Google calendar notice for an event the base ALREADY HOLDS is an
   *     announcement of a record rather than a record.
   *
   * THE SECOND AGREEMENT IS WHAT MAKES EACH SAFE, and it is the same sentence
   * both times: fold only where the original is really there. A transcript
   * counts only if the meeting holds words; a notice folds only if we hold the
   * event. An invitation to something the base does not otherwise know about is
   * the ONLY record of it — measured, 40 of them on staging — and it stays.
   *
   * "Notes:" MAIL IS NOT A NOTICE AND IS NEVER FOLDED. It carries the meeting's
   * actual minutes, and the retrieval bench cites one as a correct answer.
   *
   * RETIRED, NOT SKIPPED. The source is written and DEACTIVATED, which is the
   * difference between "the assistant stops quoting it" and "the assistant
   * quotes it forever because the sweep never visits it again" — and it means a
   * row whose condition stops being true (the meeting's transcript is cleared)
   * is REVIVED by the engine on the next tick, with no repair door to remember.
   *
   * The oracle is read ONCE per sweep and shared by both lanes; a tick that
   * cannot read it folds nothing, which is the safe direction. */

// ── LETTING GO ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEBODY DELETES A GOOGLE FILE, and what used to.
//
// Every kind this app owns the rows of retires itself. `IngestRow.retired` says
// it in as many words: "TRUE when the row has left the part of the app this kind
// mirrors — archived, switched off, deleted. The source is DEACTIVATED rather
// than skipped, which is the difference between 'the assistant stops quoting it'
// and 'the assistant quotes it forever because the sweep never visits it
// again'." An archived ticket comes back from its own table with a column set,
// and the engine acts on it.
//
// GOOGLE'S FOUR KINDS HAD NO SUCH COLUMN AND SET NO SUCH FLAG. They are not a
// table this app walks; they are a LISTING, and a deleted file is not in it. So
// the sweep moved forward past a source it would never be handed again, and the
// assistant went on quoting a document that no longer existed — indefinitely,
// because nothing in the loop was ever going to visit that row a second time.
// Edits were always fine (the content hash catches a changed file the next time
// its stamp moves). Deletions were the half nobody could see, because the
// symptom is an answer that looks perfectly normal.
//
// THE TWO RULES THIS PASS IS BUILT ON:
//
//   • ABSENCE IS NOT DELETION. A source missing from a listing may have fallen
//     outside a window, slid past a page cap, stopped matching a query, or been
//     invisible for ninety seconds because Google was unwell. Retiring on
//     absence would empty somebody's index during an outage and record it as
//     housekeeping. So absence only makes a source a CANDIDATE, and a candidate
//     is retired only when Google positively says it has gone (`googlePresence`
//     — in the bin, called off, or 404).
//   • RETIRE, NEVER DELETE. Exactly as everywhere else here: `deactivated_at` is
//     set, the chunks are dropped so nothing can be quoted from it, and the row
//     and its whole history stay where they are.
//
// AND ONE SOURCE THAT NEEDS NO GOOGLE CALL AT ALL. A Chat source IS a space
// somebody named in kwapso, so the positive signal for it is that named source
// being switched off — a fact in this app's own database. Nothing is asked of
// Google about a space, which is why `ProbableService` has three members.

/** How many of one person's sources for one kind this pass will LOOK at per
