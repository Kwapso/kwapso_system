// WORK LOGS AND TIMERS — the row of time (.plans/BUILD-1 §5).
//
// The owner named "logging time takes too many clicks" as the single thing most
// likely to make him quietly abandon this and go back to a spreadsheet. One click
// is the acceptance bar, not an aspiration, and the shape of this file is what
// pays for it: A TIMER IS A WORK LOG WITH NO END YET. There is no second table,
// no session object and no state machine — starting is one insert, stopping is
// one update, and the header can ask "what am I running?" with one indexed read.
//
// THE RULES, enforced here rather than at a door, because there is more than one
// way in (the screens, the assistant, the machine surface):
//   • a log attaches to a STORY, a TICKET or a TASK. Nothing else. Never a to-do
//     — that is somebody else's time. Never an account on its own — the owner was
//     explicit, and a figure with no work behind it is one nobody can check;
//   • whole seconds, always, computed from the two timestamps rather than trusted
//     from a caller;
//   • parallel timers on DIFFERENT targets are fine. The same person on the same
//     target twice is refused by a partial unique index, so two clicks in the
//     same instant cannot both win;
//   • billable is a plain switch, ON by default;
//   • a runaway timer is NEVER stopped for you. It is offered three one-tap
//     answers on Monday morning instead (see resolveRunaway).

 *     — the exact trap `weeklySeconds` was written to avoid. One row by

/** R99, "cannot mark anything as closed (task, story, ticket, whatever) if

 * 2026. ONE shared refusal for every door that closes a record, so a story's
 * Done, a ticket's resolve, a ticket's archive and a task's Done all ask the
 * identical question the identical way rather than four copies of one
 * predicate drifting apart.
 *
 * `target.table` is NOT re-checked against `WORK_LOG_TARGETS` here: the
 * caller already knows what it is closing (a story door names "stories", a
 * ticket door names "help", a task door names "tasks"), and re-validating an
 * allow-list this same file already owns would only be a second place that
 * list could go stale. `target.id` is bound, never interpolated.
 *
 * ANY running timer refuses the close, not only the caller's own, the same
 * reasoning `stories.ts`'s `refuseUnreviewable` states for the review step
 * beside this one: two people can be on one piece of work, and it is not
 * closed while either of them is still on the clock.
 *
 * `LIMIT 1`, not a count: the door only ever needs to know ONE thing, whether
 * to refuse, and stops at the first live row rather than counting every one
 * still running.
 *
 * `workers/content/src/lib/tasks.ts`'s `setTaskDone` carries this exact
 * check inline, dated 21 Sep 2026, with its own note to replace it with this
 * helper "the moment it lands"; this is that landing. The tasks door's own
 * replacement call is `refuseWhileTimerRuns(cfg, guard, { table: "tasks", id })`. */
