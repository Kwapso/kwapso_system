// GOOGLE BRINGS ITSELF IN — the sweep that runs without anybody pressing
// anything.
//
// THE RULING (owner, 19 Aug 2026): "If this means smoother and faster things
// without human intervention for call transcripts or a change in state for any
// file… then yes. Whatever makes it more seamless is better. Go for it, as long
// as you are sure that the mechanism is robust and we don't have duplications."
//
// WHY THIS IS A LOOP OVER PEOPLE, and could never have been anything else.
// Every Google read in this app uses ONE PERSON'S OWN connection
// (`accessTokenFor` → `google_connections WHERE user_id = ?`), so what it can
// see is exactly what that person can see. There is no team-wide Google
// credential and deliberately never was — the alternative is an agency-wide
// service account that can read every mailbox on the domain, which is a far
// larger thing to hold than anything this product needs. So an automatic sweep
// is a loop over connected people, acting as each in turn.
//
// THE POSTURE THIS CHANGES, said plainly. Before this, the server used somebody's
// Google connection only while they were in the app. Now it uses it on a
// schedule, including while they are asleep. Nothing it can reach is new — the
// token's scopes are the same ones they granted — but WHEN it reaches it is. The
// owner asked for exactly this and it is recorded here rather than in a commit
// message, because it is the sentence somebody will want to find later.
//
// WHY THERE ARE NO DUPLICATES, and it is structural rather than careful:
//
//   • A TRANSCRIPT is claimed by an UPDATE carrying its own precondition —
//     `WHERE id = ? AND transcript_captured_at IS NULL RETURNING id` — so two
//     ticks, or a tick racing the manual button, produce one capture and one
//     "already been read". The second writes nothing, logs nothing and pings
//     nothing (`captureTranscript`).
//   • The KNOWLEDGE BASE upserts on `(origin_table, origin_row_id)` and re-indexes
//     only when the content HASH changes (`sweepKind`), so sweeping the same
//     meeting twice costs a read and writes nothing.
//   • The WORK LOGS a capture writes are guarded by the same claim: they are
//     written inside the branch that won the UPDATE, so they cannot double.
//
// So the honest answer to "are you sure?" is that nothing here is trusted to run
// once. Every write is idempotent at the database, and the test beside this file
// runs the whole sweep twice to prove it.
//
// BOUNDED THREE WAYS, because a cron that can grow is a cron that will:
// people per team per tick, meetings per person per tick, and a HORIZON past
// which a meeting is abandoned. The horizon is the important one — without it a
// meeting whose transcript never appears is retried every fifteen minutes
// forever, and the newest meetings queue behind a backlog that can never drain.
