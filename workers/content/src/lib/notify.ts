 * `Promise.all` over 500 sends does not run 500 in parallel — it queues 494 of

 * first. A cron gets 15 minutes of wall clock. Five hundred sends at a couple of
 * hundred milliseconds each, six at a time, is most of that for ONE team, and the
 * digest loops over a whole window of them.
 *
 * So the fan-out is bounded twice: SEND_CONCURRENCY matches the platform's own
 * ceiling (asking for more parallelism than the runtime will give buys nothing but
 * a longer queue), and SEND_FAN_CAP is the ceiling on ONE call's recipients — past

 *
 * TO ONE PERSON, not the team. "One named person is on triage duty" (§6) is the
 * whole point of the rota: a nudge addressed to everybody is addressed to nobody.
 * When nobody has been named for the week it falls back to the whole staff list,
 * because an unread backlog with no owner is worse than a slightly noisy morning
 * — and the fix for the noise is naming somebody, which is what the mail asks for.
 *
 * NOTHING CLIENT-FACING EVER (§6, and it is the reason the digest is not simply
 * "email whoever raised it"): a ticket that has been sitting is our failure, and
 * telling a client about it turns an internal prompt into an SLA nobody promised.
 * Every recipient here comes off the team's own membership. */
