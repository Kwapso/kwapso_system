// THE FOUR SERVICES' OWN CALLS — Drive, Gmail, Calendar and Google Chat.
//
// Every function here takes an ACCESS TOKEN and returns plain data. It knows
// nothing about rows, permissions or the caller: that is decided one layer up
// (google.ts resolves whose token it is; routes/google.ts decides whether they
// may) so that this file can be read as "what we ask Google for" and checked
// against the promises the product makes.
//
// THE THREE PROMISES THIS FILE HAS TO KEEP:
//   • DRIVE IS NAMED FOLDERS, NOT A DRIVE. Every list is scoped to folder ids
//     the caller named, and a request with no folder ids returns nothing rather
//     than everything. Fail closed is not a style here — "no filter" and "no
//     restriction" are one character apart in most query languages.
//   • GMAIL IS KNOWN CONTACTS. The query is BUILT from the addresses on the
//     team's own accounts and ANDed around whatever else was asked for, so a
//     free-text search cannot widen it. No contacts → no results.
//   • CHAT IS NAMED SPACES. Same shape as Drive, for the same reason.
//
// R11 — every call is a bare `fetch` to the internet and every one carries an
// AbortSignal timeout, through the single `googleFetch` below.
//
// R14's SPIRIT, on the other axis: an external read is as unbounded as a SELECT.
// Every list here carries a page size and a CEILING, and the ceiling is ours
// rather than Google's — a door that walked Google's pagination to the end would
// be a door whose cost is set by how much material somebody happens to have.
//
// One page is the ceiling for Drive, Gmail and Chat, where the order is "newest
// first" and the tail is genuinely the material nobody is asking about. The
// CALENDAR is the exception and it was found the hard way: it is ordered by start
// time, so its tail is TOMORROW, and a busy fortnight silently lost the far end
// of the window. It walks up to CALENDAR_MAX_PAGES and says so in the tail when
// it stops early — a bounded read that drops rows without saying so is exactly
// the fault R14 is about.

 * in. Mail he can see, about his own agency, that kwapso could not find. A
 * three-way thread where the client replies to a colleague and copies you is not
 * an edge case; it is how half of an agency's mail arrives.

 * would otherwise build a query Google refuses — which reads, from the outside,
 * exactly like "you have no mail from anybody". The worst failure shape there
 * is: a fence that is working perfectly and an inbox that appears empty.
 *
 * Eighty is not a guess. It is the size of the query this product has been
 * asking Google with — forty contacts in two directions — and answering with,
 * so it is the one length there is evidence for. Adding `cc` above would have
 * taken the same forty contacts to a hundred and twenty terms and roughly 3,500
 * characters, well past anything that has ever been tried here.
 *
 * WHY THE BUDGET IS IN TERMS AND THE CAP IS ARITHMETIC. The next person to add a
 * fourth direction cannot forget to shrink the cap, because there is nothing to
 * remember: the query gets narrower in contacts instead of longer in characters,
 * automatically. A number that has to be kept in step by hand is a number that

 *
 * This used to read the DIRECT CHILDREN of each named folder, one page of fifty.
 * The owner reported that his call transcripts were not in the knowledge base,
 * and this was why: Google Meet does not file a recording as a file in a folder,
 * it files it as A FOLDER PER MEETING holding the transcript, the recording and
 * the Gemini notes. His shared `Google Meet` folder therefore contained nothing
 * but subfolders — every one of them excluded by the `mimeType != folder` clause
 * — so a folder that looked shared contributed exactly nothing, silently, and
 * had done since the day he shared it. Measured on his account: 15 shared
 * folders, 54 files.
 *
 * A person who shares a folder means that folder and what is filed under it.
 * This now reads it that way.
 *
 * ── WHAT KEEPS IT BOUNDED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * BREADTH-FIRST, NEWEST-FIRST, ON A CALL BUDGET. The budget is in listing calls
 * because a call is what costs time and quota — a folder of ten files and one of
 * five hundred are both one call per page, and the thing that actually runs away
 * is the number of FOLDERS, which nobody controls. Breadth-first means the named
 * folder's own contents are always read before anything below them; newest-first
 * means that when the budget runs out it has been spent on what somebody is most
 * likely to ask about. A walk that ran out of budget is not an error and does not
 * say so here: the sweep is incremental and the cursor comes back.
 *
 * THE ROOT TRAVELS WITH THE FILE, and this is the load-bearing detail. A file's
 * `folderId` is the NAMED folder it descends from, never its immediate parent —
 * because the caller looks the shelf and the client up by that id
 * (`shelfOf.get(file.folderId)` in google-read.ts). Tagging a file with the
 * subfolder it happens to sit in would have made every descended file
 * shelf-less, which is to say private and unfiled: the recursion would have
 * "worked" and quietly hidden everything it found.
 *
 * NO CYCLES, NO DOUBLE READS. Drive lets a file sit in two parents, so a folder
 * can genuinely be reached twice; `seenFolders` makes the walk a tree rather
 * than a graph, and the first named root to reach a folder is the one that owns
 * what is in it.

 * GOOGLE'S OWN NOTICES ABOUT YOUR OWN MATERIAL — a second, narrower fence, and
 * the ONLY other one this product will build.
 *
 * The owner asked for it in as many words: kwapso should find "any emails that
 * come describing that a Google Doc has been created for a particular calendar
 * or particular meeting". Those mails exist and they are useful — a Meet
 * transcript announces itself by email minutes after the call — and every one of
 * them is from a Google no-reply address, which is by definition not a contact
 * on anybody's account. The known-contact fence therefore excludes them
 * perfectly, which is why this was invisible.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A WIDENING OF THE MAIL PROMISE. The promise is "only mail to or
 * from someone on one of your accounts", and it is about mail with PEOPLE — the
 * thing a person would mind kwapso reading. This names four robots, spelled out
 * here in the server's own source, that write to you about files you already own.
 * It cannot be steered: the addresses are a constant, the caller contributes only
 * the narrowing terms, and there is no request parameter anywhere that reaches
 * this list. A mail from a colleague can never match it.
 *
 * IT IS STILL A SECOND DOOR ON SOMEBODY'S MAILBOX, and it is used by exactly one
 * caller (the transcript hunt), never by the assistant's own mail tools and never
 * by the knowledge sweep — which read through `knownContactQuery` and are
 * unchanged.
 */
/* SCOPE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT APPLY HERE, and this is the note that stops the
 * next person closing it as an oversight.
 *
 * A person's mail SCOPE (lib/google.ts's SCOPE essay) narrows every other read
 * of their mailbox to the labels they named. This one query is exempt, ruled so
 * on 27 August 2026, for two reasons that hold together and would not hold
 * apart:
 *
 *   • THERE IS NOTHING TO PROTECT. The four senders below are Google's own
 *     robots, spelled out in this file, unreachable from any request parameter.
 *     A mail from a colleague, a client or a supplier cannot match them. So
 *     narrowing this query buys no privacy — it only decides whether we can find
 *     a notice about a document the person already owns.
 *   • AND IT WOULD COST A FEATURE. A notice arrives with whatever label Gmail
 *     gives it, which is almost never one somebody scoped kwapso to. Applying
 *     scope here would silently stop transcripts being found for exactly the
 *     people careful enough to have set a scope — a real loss traded for no
 *     gain, and a silent one, which is the failure this whole lane exists to
 *     avoid.
 *
 * If a fifth sender is ever added, or if this query is ever reached by a second
 * caller, that trade has to be made again rather than inherited. */

 * A HEADER VALUE THAT SURVIVES THE WIRE — RFC 2047, and it is not optional.
 *
 * ── THE BUG THIS ENDS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * MIME headers are SEVEN-BIT. `Content-Type: …; charset=UTF-8` two lines below
 * describes the BODY and says nothing whatever about the headers, which is the
 * trap: the message looks correctly declared, and it is — for the half that was
 * never broken. A subject with a non-ASCII character in it went onto the wire as
 * raw UTF-8 bytes in a header field, where no charset applies, and every
 * receiver falls back to Latin-1/CP1252. So "— sweep" left as bytes E2 80 94 and
 * came back read as three separate characters.
 *
 * MEASURED ON STAGING, 31 Aug 2026, in the knowledge base itself, because the
 * Gmail sweep then files what the app sent:
 *   sent     "kwapso sweep 2026-08-17T12-50-42-898Z — sweep"
 *   stored   "kwapso sweep 2026-08-17T12-50-42-898Z Ã¢Â€Â” sweep"
 *   and its reply, having been through the loop a second time,
 *            "Re: kwapso sweep … ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã¢Â‚Â¬ÃƒÂ‚Ã¢Â€Â  sweep"
 *
 * The reply carrying MORE layers than the message is the signature of the fault:
 * each round trip mangles what the last one mangled. It is not a display
 * problem. Those are the bytes a client's mail server received, and the em dash
 * is the least of it — a client named Zöllner or Dauerbäck gets their own name
 * mangled in the subject line of every mail this app sends them.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DOES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Pure ASCII is left EXACTLY as it was — encoding it would be a change to every
 * mail the app has ever sent, for no gain, and an encoded word is harder for a
 * human reading raw source. Anything else becomes one base64 encoded word.
 * Deliberately whole-value rather than per-word: an encoded word may not exceed
 * 75 characters, so a long subject is split on a UTF-8 CHARACTER boundary and
 * the pieces are joined by a fold, which is what RFC 2047 § 2 requires — a
 * multi-byte character split across two words is the classic way of fixing this
 * bug and introducing it again one layer down.

 * my calendar should be up to date here. That's all." Every write this file once
 * held — create an entry, patch its title or times, add and remove guests, set a

 * stood on them. What is left is this read and `calendarGet` beside it, so a
 * calendar cannot be changed FROM kwapso by a person, by the assistant, or by a
 * machine on the MCP surface: there is no function here that could send one, and
 * a missing function cannot be forgotten the way a condition can be inverted.
 *
 * AND THE GRANT NOW SAYS THE SAME THING. This note used to end by admitting that
 * the app still asked Google for the read/WRITE scope (`calendar.events`),
 * because a grant is additive at Google and narrowing it would cost every
 * connected person a reconnect. That was a promise kept in our own code with the
 * power still held — the weaker half of the pair the `drive.file` note is proud
 * of. The ask is `calendar.readonly` as of 18 August 2026, the reconnect is the
 * price, and google-oauth.ts spells out the three things that make the narrowing
 * REAL rather than cosmetic (revoke on disconnect, forced consent, and reading
 * back what Google actually granted).
 *
 * NO `fields` MASK, deliberately. Google's default is the whole event resource,
 * which is exactly what this app now wants — the guest list, the organiser, the
 * conference link, the attachments and the repeat rule are all on it. A mask
 * would make the response smaller and would make every future field somebody
 * needs a silent absence rather than a value: the failure mode of a typo'd mask
 * is not an error, it is a field that is quietly always empty. The read is
 * bounded by `maxResults` either way, which is the cost that actually matters.
 *
 * `showDeleted` is off by default and ON for the re-sync (see syncCalendar in
 * lib/meetings.ts). With `singleEvents=true` a cancelled instance simply is not
 * in the window unless it is asked for, so a calendar that never asks can never
 * learn that Tuesday's call was called off — it only ever sees the entry stop

 * for every human. The next obvious place is the membership, so the app asked
 * for `chat.memberships.readonly` and the owner re-approved his connection for
 * it — and Google's `spaces.members.list` answered:
 *
 *   {"name":"users/100183613978081019947","type":"HUMAN"}
 *
 * The roster, with no names on it. There is no Chat scope that returns one.
 *
 * So the directory is the third place and the only one that has the answer. A
 * Chat user id IS a People resource id, which is what makes this a lookup rather
 * than a search: `users/112978…` becomes `people/112978…` and comes back with
 * the name that person uses everywhere else in Google.
 *
 * ── HOW IT FAILS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Silently, and to the honest description. This is an IMPROVEMENT to a message,
 * so it may never cost one: an older grant without the directory scope, a
 * project where the People API is not switched on, an external member who is not
 * in this directory — each returns no name for that person and the message still
 * arrives saying "Somebody in this space", which is the truth rather than a
 * guess. The one thing it must never do is invent a name, because a wrong
 * attribution in a quoted conversation is worse than no attribution at all.

// may act on.
//
// Every other kind of material in this app is a row in a table the sweep walks,
// so "it was archived" is a column the sweep READS. Google's four kinds are not:
// they are a live listing, and a file somebody deleted is simply not in it. The
// sweep walks forward past a source it will never see again, and the assistant
// goes on quoting a document that no longer exists — indefinitely, because
// nothing ever tells the index to let go.
//
// ABSENCE IS NOT DELETION, and that is the whole reason this is a separate call
// rather than a set subtraction. An item can be missing from a listing because
// it fell outside a window, because it slid past a page cap, because a query
// stopped matching it, or because Google had a bad minute. Retiring on absence
// would empty somebody's index during an outage and call it tidying up.
//
// So the answer is THREE-VALUED and only one of the three does anything:
//
//   • "gone"    — Google said so. In the bin, called off, or no longer there at
//                 all (404). The source is retired: it stops being quoted, and
//                 the row and its history survive, because nothing here deletes.
//   • "there"   — Google handed it over. Nothing happens.
//   • "unknown" — anything else, including a refusal (403) and a timeout. A
//                 refusal is genuinely ambiguous: sharing withdrawn and a Shared
//                 Drive having a policy look identical from here, and one of
//                 those is not a deletion. Nothing happens, and the next sweep
//                 asks again — the cheapest possible way to be wrong.
