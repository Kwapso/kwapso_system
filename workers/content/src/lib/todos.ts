// TO-DOS — something we are waiting on the CLIENT for (.plans/BUILD-1 §2).
//
// This is the ONE part of the work engine a client login can write to, and the
// only file in it that carries an account fence rather than a flat refusal. The
// difference is the whole design: a story is our work and a client sees a count
// of it; a to-do is aimed AT them, sits in their portal with a due date, and they
// complete it themselves and upload a file against it (SCOPE ch.06 — two of the
// six things a contact can do).
//
// IT IS A SEPARATE TABLE FROM `tasks` AND A SEPARATE FILE FROM lib/tasks.ts, for
// the reason the two rate cards are separate: same shape, opposite audiences. A
// list of the agency's internal chores rendered on a client's screen is one
// forgotten `WHERE kind = 'todo'` away in the one-table version, and no distance
// away at all in this one — the internal chores are not in the table this file
// can name.
//
// NO WORK LOG EVER ATTACHES TO ONE. Enforced where time is written
// (WORK_LOG_TARGETS in lib/work-logs.ts) rather than here, because that is the
// door somebody would have to get past.

 *     expression IS "no date last, then soonest first": the nulls-last flag and
 *     the date are the same key, not two.
 *   • DONE — `completed_at` descending, newest first. Naturally single, and the
 *     column is NOT NULL for every row this view can return.
 *
 * TWO ORDERINGS MEANS TWO SIGNATURES, which is the property that matters more
 * than either sort. `resolveOrdering` stamps `<name>:<dir>` into every cursor and
 * `decodeCursor` refuses one minted under a different ordering (400, the same
