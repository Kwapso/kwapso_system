// file straight into plain Node so that the "before" arm of every measurement is
// really the shipped code. One `@shared/…` import here and that stops working,
// which is exactly how it was found. The one constant that wanted to live here
// and could not — the derived chunk ceiling — is in knowledge.ts beside the
// validator it is derived from.
//
// Two sections, in the order the pipeline uses them:
//   1. TEXT   — hash (has this changed?), chunk (what does a citation point at?),
//               tokenise (what does stage one of retrieval match on?).
//   2. VECTOR — the quantised embedding codec and its similarity, so stage two
//               can re-rank a bounded candidate set with no float array in D1.
