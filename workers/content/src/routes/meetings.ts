// MEETING routes — Meetings, its agenda and its notes.
//
// EVERY DOOR HERE REFUSES A CLIENT LOGIN, AT THE DOOR (R21). A meeting's notes
// are OUR record of a conversation — written for us, often about the client
// rather than for them — so there is no fenced slice of this module to serve a
// contact; there is a refusal. The refusal is written on each handler rather
// than left to the portal gateway's allow-list, because the agency gateway
// forwards by PREFIX and a client login is an ordinary team member holding an
// ordinary role: a door not named on the portal's list is still served to that
// same person at the other hostname. That mistake has been made twice in this
// codebase and caught twice.
//
// The one thing a client WILL eventually see about a meeting is the sprint it
// belongs to — which they already see, through the delivery door, with nothing
// of this module in it.

 * update the information").
 *
 * THREE THINGS, over a LIVE WINDOW that straddles today. Every entry in it that
 * is not a record becomes one; every meeting whose entry is in it has its Google
 * facts brought up to date — the guest list and what each person answered, the
 * organiser, the join link, the attachments, the location, the description; and
 * an entry cancelled in Google is called off here. The instances beyond the
 * horizon come back read-only in `ahead` — shown so nobody is surprised by them,
 * not stored, because an instance six months out can still be moved.
 *
 * AND A FOURTH: THE BACKFILL. The live window is a few weeks either side of
 * today, which is not "everything in my calendar". So one SLICE of the wider
 * window is walked on every call from a cursor kept on the caller's own calendar
 * connection, and `swept` says how far that walk has reached. It resumes where
 * it stopped, which is what makes a years-wide read bounded (R14) rather than
 * unbounded. lib/meetings.ts holds the whole argument and the numbers.
 *
 * THE BACKWARD HALF IS WHY THE TRANSCRIPTS LAND. Everything interesting about a
 * meeting arrives after it, and a sweep that only ever looked forward saw each
 * one exactly once, at the moment when the least was known about it.
 *
 * It creates meetings, so it opens on this module's `create` right; it reads the
 * caller's own calendar with the caller's own token, so it demands `google:read`
 * besides. Idempotent by the unique index on the event id for the creates, and
