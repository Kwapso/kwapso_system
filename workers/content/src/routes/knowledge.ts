 *
 * WHY A SECOND DOOR RATHER THAN A CHANGED ONE. The upload CONTRACT differs: the
 * file is the body, so the metadata that used to sit beside it in the JSON moves
 * to the query string. A client built against the old shape must keep working —
 * it is deployed, and a browser holds its own copy of the app for as long as the
 * tab is open — so the buffered door stays exactly as it was and this one sits
 * beside it. Nothing is migrated; the new client simply picks the new door. When
 * no build in the wild uses the old one, deleting it is a separate, boring change.
 *
 * WHAT IT ACTUALLY FIXES. The buffered door's 25 MB was never a judgement about
 * files — it was the largest number that fits in a 128 MB isolate three times
 * over: `request.json()` materialises the whole body, a base64 data URL is ~4/3
 * of the file it carries, and the decode makes another copy. Here the body is
 * handed to R2 as it arrives, so the isolate holds a window rather than a file.
 * The ceiling moves from 25 MB to 90 MB, and what stops it there is the PLATFORM's
 * own request-body limit rather than anything in this code (limits.ts says so, and
 * says what the only door past it is).
 *
 * THE METADATA IS STILL VALIDATED AT THE BOUNDARY (R20), and the query string is
 * held to exactly the same positional rule the body is: every `searchParams.get`
 * sits inside a checker, never in a truthiness test and never behind a cast.
 * Moving a field from a body to a query string must not be a way to leave the
 * validation seam behind — that is precisely the substitution R20's query census
 * exists to catch.
 *
 * THE KEY CARRIES NO CALLER INPUT AT ALL. It is the team's id, this module's own
 * segment and a fresh ULID, so there is no path to contain, no dot-segment to reject and no
 * escape to think about — the strongest form of the rule `safeObjectKey` states
 * for the backup, arrived at by the key having no user-supplied segment rather
 * than by filtering one. The declared FILE NAME is a label on the row; it never
 * reaches the key.
 *
 * R21 at the door, like every other handler here. */
