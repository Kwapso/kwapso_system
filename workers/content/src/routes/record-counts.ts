// THE BADGE DOOR, CONTENT'S HALF — how much of the work engine hangs off ONE
// record, in one round trip, before anybody has clicked a tab.
//
// The reasoning is written once, on the tenancy half
// (workers/tenancy/src/routes/record-counts.ts): counts eagerly and rows lazily,
// a refusal for client logins at the door (R21), one module's read right per
// COLLECTION rather than one for the door (R18), and not a single figure counted
// here that the module's own list does not already count the same way (R16).
//
// IT IS TWO DOORS AND NOT ONE, and the reason is the code rather than the data.
// Every team's rows live in one database, but the counting FUNCTIONS live in the
// worker that owns each module, and a domain worker binds only AUTH and REALTIME
// — so for content to count an account's apps, or tenancy to count its sprints,
// one of them would have to write a second expression for a number the other
// already owns. That is exactly the drift R16 exists to prevent, and it would be
// bought with a worker-to-worker hop that costs more than the browser asking
// both doors at once. The screen asks whichever doors a record actually needs
// (`shared/record-counts.ts` says which), in parallel, and merges the answers.
