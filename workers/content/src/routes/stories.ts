// STORY + SPRINT routes — the work engine's own doors. Same opening as every
// other content route (the shared gated opening → validate at the boundary →
// write → publishChange), with ONE addition that is the whole security posture
// of this module:
//
//   EVERY DOOR HERE REFUSES A CLIENT LOGIN (R21).
//
// Not because of what they change, but because of what they ANSWER WITH. A story
// carries a title, an assignee, a reviewer and a date, and "which staff member is
// doing the work" is the one thing SCOPE ch.06 says the portal never shows. The
// agency gateway forwards /api/content/* by PREFIX and a client login is an
// ordinary team member, so leaving these doors off the portal's allow-list would
// defend them at the wrong hostname — the exact mistake R21 was earned by, twice.
// A client's view of a story is a COUNT on their own ticket, served by the ticket
// door, and nothing else.
//
// There is therefore NO account fence in lib/stories.ts, and there must not be
// one: a fence implies a client can reach these rows through it.
