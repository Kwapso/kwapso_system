// Staff-profile routes — a member's profile and the certificates they hold.
//
// TWO THINGS ARE DIFFERENT HERE from the other three internal modules, and both
// are about the same fact: these rows are about a PERSON.
//
//   • THE PROFILE IS ONE DOOR, not a create and an edit. A person either has a
//     profile or they don't, and the screen filling in the form has no way of
//     knowing which — two doors would push that question onto the caller, and
//     the answer they would both use is a read-then-decide, which is a race
//     between two open tabs. So it is an upsert, gated once on `edit`: writing
//     down what a colleague is like is the same act whether or not a row already
//     existed, and a permission that depends on invisible state is one nobody
//     can reason about. `create` gates the CERTIFICATE door instead, where a new
//     record really is a new record.
//   • THERE IS NO PROFILE EXPORT. A credential register is the kind of thing
//     somebody hands an auditor; a one-click spreadsheet of what the team is bad
//     at is a capability nobody asked for.
//
// R21 on every door, both halves. This is the sharpest case of agency-only
// material in the app: a client login reading a colleague's weaknesses.

/** A profile photo or a certificate — STREAMED. The same capability as the door above,
 * with the file arriving AS the request body instead of inside it.
 *
 * WHY A SECOND DOOR RATHER THAN A CHANGED ONE, and why all four upload doors now
 * come in pairs: the upload CONTRACT differs, and a browser holds its own copy of
 * this app for as long as the tab is open. A build shipped before the deploy keeps
 * posting a base64 data URL to the door above, so that one stays exactly as it was
 * until nothing in the wild uses it. An upload contract is the one change where the
 * server has to be ready before the client and outlast it afterwards.
 *
 * WHAT IT FIXES. 25 MB was never a judgement about files — it was the largest
 * number that fits in a 128 MB isolate three times over: `request.json()`
 * materialises the whole body, a base64 data URL is ~4/3 of the file it carries,
 * and the decode makes another copy. Here the body goes to R2 as it arrives, so
 * the isolate holds a window rather than a file (limits.ts:
 * STREAM_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES, and what stops it THERE is the platform's own
 * request-body limit rather than anything in this code).
 *
 * AND THE ALLOW-LIST STILL DECIDES, which is the one way this door differs from
 * the knowledge base's streamed twin. That one stores every byte as
 * `application/octet-stream`, so it can afford to take any file at all. This one
 * serves the object BACK under the type the caller declared — that is what makes
 * an image render — so a script-capable type (`text/html`, `image/svg+xml`) would
 * be stored XSS on the app's own origin. `INLINE_SAFE_UPLOAD` is the boundary that
 * stops it, imported from `shared/workers/image.ts` rather than restated, because a
 * second copy of that list is one nobody remembers to narrow.
 *
 * There is NO metadata on this door and so no query string to validate: the file
 * is the whole request, the type is a header, and the key is minted here. R21 at
 * the door, on the write half, as the buffered door already does.
 *
 * HOUSEKEEPING: it writes a file, not a record — nothing to broadcast. */
