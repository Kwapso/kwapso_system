// GOOGLE ROUTES — connecting an account, choosing what it shares, and reading
// and writing through it.
//
// EVERY DOOR HERE REFUSES A CLIENT LOGIN, AT THE DOOR (R21). Not "clients have
// no screen for this" — no client login may pass any of these, full stop: they
// get no assistant and no Google surface at all. The refusal is written on each
// handler rather than left to the portal gateway's allow-list, because the
// AGENCY gateway forwards by PREFIX and a client login is an ordinary team
// member holding an ordinary role. A door not named on the portal's list is
// still served to that same person at the other hostname. That mistake has been
// made twice in this codebase and caught twice.
//
// THE OTHER RULE EVERY DOOR HERE FOLLOWS: whose connection it is comes from the
// GUARD, never from the request. There is no `?userId=` anywhere in this file
// and there is nowhere to put one — the read functions in lib/google.ts take a
// guard and select on `guard.userId`. "The assistant sees only what that person
// can see" is therefore a property of the code's shape rather than a check
// somebody has to remember.
//
// THE TWO SWITCHES, and which door each one guards:
//   • google:create      — may connect a Google account (and name a folder/space);
//   • google_mail:create — kwapso may SEND mail as you.
// The second is demanded ON TOP of `google:edit`, so a role that can send but
// cannot otherwise use the connection is not a state anybody can reach. And it
// is demanded of the PERSON pressing "send it from kwapso" exactly as it is of
// the assistant: it is the same act, by the same product, out of the same
// mailbox, so it is the same permission.
//
// THERE WAS A THIRD, `google_events:create` — "kwapso may put an EVENT in your
// calendar" — and it went with the doors it guarded. The calendar is READ-ONLY
// here now: this file reads a calendar and never writes one. See the note where the
// six write doors used to be, below the events read.

 * material, and silent dropping is a failure this knowledge base has already
 * been bitten by twice. So the lever is scope, and this is where a person pulls
 * it.
 *
 * TWO INDEPENDENT AXES, and they are separate on purpose. `mode` says which
 * CONTAINERS (the calendars, the mail labels — rows this person names through
 * the sources door beside this one). `eventTypes` says which KINDS of thing in a
 * calendar. A person can narrow either without touching the other, and folding
 * them into one word would make "only my work calendar" and "not my birthdays"
 * the same decision.
 *
 * `eventTypes` MAY NOT BE EMPTY when it is sent. Storing an empty allow-list
 * would round-trip back into "every kind" (see `eventTypeList`), so unticking
 * every box would be a gesture that reads as a narrowing and acts as a
 * widening — the same trap `scope_mode` exists to close on the other axis. Omit
 * the field to leave the kinds alone; send a list to choose them.

 * was read under the OLD scope and stays answerable — which is precisely the
 * material somebody narrowing is trying to be rid of. So `forget` retires this
 * person's sources for that service and rewinds the lane, and the next sweep
 * brings back exactly what is in scope. It is a re-read and a re-embed of one
 * person's own mail or calendar, so the screen says so in words and the person

 * the owner's instruction on 18 August 2026: "disable the ability to create,
 * edit, or delete anything in the calendar from the frontend… scour through our
 * entire documentation and just make it one-way so we only grab and update the

 * rather than to delete quietly: a meeting arranged in kwapso no longer appears
 * in anybody's Google Calendar, and a sprint's dates no longer become an all-day
 * block. The answer to both is to put it in Google, where it will be read back
 * here on the next sweep with its guests, its join link and its attachments —
 * which is the direction the whole module now runs in.
 *
 * THE REFUSAL IS STRUCTURAL, NOT A CONDITION. There is no flag here that turns
 * writing back on and no permission that grants it: lib/google-api.ts holds no
 * function that can send one, so the switch that used to guard these doors
 * (`google_events`, "Calendar on your behalf") was retired with them rather than
 * left on the Roles screen promising a capability nothing has. Same reasoning as
