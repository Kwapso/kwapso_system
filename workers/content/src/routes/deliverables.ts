// THE HANDOVER SHELF ON ONE APP (CHECKLIST 8.7) — five doors, and the same
// sentence at the top of every one of them.
//
// R21, AT THE DOOR, ON ALL SIX OF THE AGENCY'S. `deliverables` is a module a
// client login could plausibly be granted — the material IS theirs, it is what we
// hand over — and that is exactly why the refusal is written here rather than
// assumed from the portal gateway's allow-list. The agency gateway forwards by
// PREFIX and a client login is an ordinary team member holding an ordinary role,
// so a door the portal withheld is served to the same person at the other
// hostname unless it says no itself.
//
// THE DAY ARRIVED (18 August 2026), AND THE SHAPE OF THE ANSWER IS THE POINT.
// The owner: "yes of course.. the deliverables are for them! but only once we
// mark it as visible yeah?" — so a client may now read their own shelf, through
// ONE new door, `GET /api/content/portal/deliverables`, which is the LAST handler
// in this file and the only one that does not refuse them.
//
// It is a SEPARATE DOOR rather than a mode on the agency's, and that is the same
// decision `GET /api/content/portal/delivery` made about sprints one module over.
// Three reasons, in order of how much they would cost to get wrong:
//   • THE SHAPE IS HALF THE FENCE. The staff answer carries `creatorName`,
//     `editorName` and `active`; SCOPE ch.06 says the portal shows the work and
//     never which staff member is doing it. A door that answered both audiences
//     would be one `if` away from saying our names out loud, forever.
//   • THE QUESTION IS DIFFERENT. Staff ask "what is on THIS app's shelf"
//     (`?appId=`); a client asks "what has been handed to MY company", across
//     every app they own. Two questions, two `WHERE`s.
//   • THE AGENCY'S FIVE KEEP THEIR REFUSAL, UNTOUCHED. Opening a mode on the
//     existing read would have meant deleting a `refusePortalCaller` — and R21
//     was earned twice by defences that were removed or never added. A new door
//     beside them changes nothing about the five that already say no.
//
// THE APP IS THE FILTER, AND IT IS ASKED OF THE SERVER. `?appId=` narrows here,
// never in the browser: the count beside the tab is the door's own COUNT(*) over
// the same WHERE the rows came from (R16), and a browser-side filter would put a
// number from one question above a list answering another.
//
// THE PING CARRIES THE APP, NOT THE DELIVERABLE (R1 + R15) — AND NOW THE ACCOUNT
// AS WELL. A deliverable has no list and no screen of its own — it is only ever
// read on the app it belongs to — so the APP is the one row a listener can act
// on, and the app id is what lets it name the shelf and the badge exactly. The
// same shape `account_rates` and `account_links` already have, one spine along.
//
// The moment a CLIENT can hear this resource, an app id stops being enough: it
// says nothing about whose app it is, and `mayHearChange` has nothing to fence a
// portal socket against. So every publish below passes the account as
// `ChangeEvent.scope`, `deliverables` joins `SCOPE_STAMPED_RESOURCES`, and the
// writes hand the account back rather than the routes asking for it again. A
// publish that forgot the scope would be heard by no client at all — silence, the
// direction that file fails in on purpose.
//
// ONE UPLOAD DOOR, NOT TWO. Its four elders come in pairs — a buffered base64
// door kept alive for browser builds that were already loaded when the streamed
// twin shipped. A door with no clients in the wild has nothing to be compatible
// with, so this module ships only the streamed shape and never grows the
// 128 MB-isolate arithmetic the buffered one is stuck with.
