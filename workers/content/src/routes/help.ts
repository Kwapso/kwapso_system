 * The second and last thing in the product that emails a client (BUILD-1 §7),
 * and the reason it is its own door rather than a side effect of the status
 * move: a resolution is SENT BY A PERSON. The words arrive in the body — the
 * screen pre-fills them from the ticket's draft, which each story's closing note
 * has been building as the work finished — and a person edits them and presses
 * send. A status that emailed on its own would make "resolved" a thing you can
 * do by accident.
 *
 * THREE THINGS, IN ONE CALL AND IN THIS ORDER:
 *   1. move the ticket to resolved. R17 gates everything after it — an already-
 *      resolved ticket moves zero rows, so the client is not emailed twice about
 *      the same answer, which is the failure this order exists to prevent;
 *   2. append the resolution to the conversation, so what we said lives where
 *      everything else about the request lives rather than only in an inbox;
 *   3. email their people.
 *
 * Refused to a client login (R21), like every other status move on this module. */
