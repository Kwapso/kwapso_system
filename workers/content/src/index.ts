// kwapso CONTENT worker — team-DB content modules (Tickets, the work engine
// and the Knowledge base). This file is just the SWITCHBOARD: it maps each route to
// a handler (grouped by domain under ./routes/*) and centrally maps thrown
// GuardErrors to clean HTTP responses. The shared opening (whoAmI / teamContext
// / requireRight) lives in the shared gating seam.
//
// IT HAS TWO CRONS, and the scheduled handler branches on which one fired:
//   • every 15 minutes — keep the knowledge base in step with the rows this
//     worker owns. Bounded per tick, resumable from a cursor;
//   • once a morning — the triage digest: what has been sitting unread past
//     three days, and on Mondays who logged no time last week. One message, to
//     the person whose week it is, and never to a client.
// Both record their failures (R12): unattended work has nobody watching.

 *
 * Both crons used to read `ORDER BY id LIMIT CRON_TEAM_CAP` and both said, in a
 * comment, that "the remaining teams wait for the next tick". They did not. The
 * order never changed and neither did the window, so the same 200 teams were
 * swept and mailed every time and every team past the 200th was skipped —
 * forever, not late. Team ids are ULIDs, so "the first 200 by id" is "the 200
 * oldest": the newest tenants were the ones getting nothing, silently, which is
 * the worst possible direction for it to fail in.
 *
 * The fix keeps every property the cap was bought for — bounded work per tick,
 * nothing to remember between ticks — and adds the one it was missing: the window
 * MOVES. `scheduledTime` divided by the tick's own period is a counter that
 * advances once per fire, and modulo the number of windows it walks the whole
 * estate and comes back round. No cursor table, no migration, no state to get
 * out of step, and it is deterministic — a re-run of the same tick does the same
 * teams.
 *
 * OFFSET, DELIBERATELY. Keyset paging is the house rule for anything a person
 * scrolls (shared/workers/paging.ts), and it is the wrong tool here: this needs
 * "the Nth window of the whole estate", which is what an offset IS. `teams` is
 * one row per tenant — thousands, not millions — and this runs twice a day and
 * every fifteen minutes on a table that size. If it ever became the expensive
 * part of a tick, the estate would be big enough to deserve a real work queue,
 * which is the Tier-C answer the scaling review names.
 *
 * A LATE TEAM IS THE COST, and it is named honestly: with more than
 * CRON_TEAM_CAP teams the sweep's lap takes ceil(total/cap) ticks (fifteen
 * minutes each) and the digest's lap takes that many DAYS. Fifteen minutes late
 * is what the sweep was designed for. Days late is not a daily digest, and the
 * tick says so out loud rather than looking healthy. */
