// THE BADGE DOOR, content's half — driven through the SHIPPED route handler
// against a real SQLite database running the real team migrations.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR. A record's collection tabs were badged out of a cache sidecar
// that only the tab PANEL's own list fetch ever primed, so the number appeared
// when you clicked the tab and not before — and `formatCount` renders nothing
// for "none" AND nothing for "not loaded", so an unopened tab was
// indistinguishable from an empty one. The fix is to fetch the COUNTS eagerly
// and leave the ROWS lazy, and this is the door that does it.
//
// FOUR THINGS ARE WORTH LOCKING, each a way it could be quietly wrong while
// looking right on screen:
//
//   1. IT REFUSES A CLIENT LOGIN (R21). Everything it counts is the agency's own
//      picture of a customer, and the door is reachable at the agency origin by
//      anybody with a session — a client login included, because that is an
//      ordinary team member holding an ordinary role.
//
//   2. A MODULE THE CALLER CANNOT READ COMES BACK `null`, NOT ZERO (R18). The
//      one that would never be noticed: a `0` is a confident statement that
//      there are none, and it looks identical to the truth.
//
//   3. EACH FIGURE IS THE COLLECTION THE TAB ACTUALLY REVEALS. The count and the
//      list must be the same question — an archived ticket counted under a tab
//      that hides archived tickets is a number the list can never reach, which
//      is R16's failure in its quietest form.
//
//   4. AN UNKNOWN RECORD KIND IS A CLEAN 400, not an empty object that reads
//      like an answer (R20: the table is held to an allow-list derived from the
//      registry).
