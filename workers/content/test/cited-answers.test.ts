// LAW R23 — AN ANSWER FROM THE KNOWLEDGE BASE CARRIES ITS SOURCES, OR IT IS NOT
// AN ANSWER.
//
// Two halves, and the second is the one that keeps the first honest:
//
//   1. THE SEAM IS RUN, not read. `knowledgeAnswer` is called with real inputs
//      and its output inspected — `found`, `passages` and `citations` are ONE
//      decision, so a passage can never travel without the source it came from,
//      and an empty result carries the sentence the assistant must say instead
//      of inventing one. Reading the source for the word "citations" would pass
//      just as loudly if the function returned them empty.
//
//   2. NOTHING ELSE BUILDS ONE. The knowledge routes are scanned off disk: no
//      hand-built `json(` may hand back `passages`, exactly as R14 forbids a
//      hand-built page. A door that assembles half this contract ships half this
//      contract, and here the missing half is the difference between "we have
//      nothing on that" and a confident answer with nothing behind it.
