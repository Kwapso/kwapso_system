// WORK LOGS AND TIMERS, driven through the SHIPPED route handlers against a real
// SQLite database running the real team migrations.
//
// The rules here are the ones a source scan cannot see, and every one of them is
// a way a plausible timesheet goes quietly wrong: two clicks producing two timers
// on the same work, a caller telling the server how long something took, an hour
// vanishing without a trace, a binned timer still counted in a total.
//
// THE ALLOW-LIST CASES ARE DERIVED from WORK_LOG_TARGETS itself, so adding a
// fourth loggable thing is one line in the lib and is held to the same rules the
// day it lands — and the case that matters most, that a TO-DO can never be one,
// is written against the list rather than against today's contents.
