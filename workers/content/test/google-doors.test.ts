// THE FOUR THINGS THAT MUST BE TRUE OF EVERY GOOGLE DOOR — derived off disk, so
// a door written tomorrow is judged today.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS BESIDE R21 rather than inside it. R21's derivation is
// PERMISSION-SHAPED: it reads the Client role's rights out of the seed and walks
// only the doors that role could pass. No client role holds a `google` right, so
// R21 walks past this whole module and reports clean — correctly, and uselessly
// for the promise the owner actually made, which was not "clients cannot reach
// it today" but "clients get no assistant and no Google surface at all". That
// promise is PATH-shaped, and this check is the path-shaped one. The two fail
// for different reasons: R21 catches an owner ticking `google: read` on a client
// role; this catches a door that ships without its refusal in the first place.
//
// The other three are the module's own invariants, each earned by how easy it
// would be to write the opposite:
//   • the two SWITCHES the owner named are demanded by the doors that perform
//     the acts — derived from which handler calls which Google function, never
//     from a list of handler names somebody keeps in step;
//   • no shape a screen sees can carry a token;
//   • whose connection it is comes from the guard, never from a parameter.
