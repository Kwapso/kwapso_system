// THE TRANSCRIPT, FROM GOOGLE TO A WORK LOG TO AN ANSWER — the write path
// nothing had ever run.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS
//
// CHECKLIST 9.2, 18.3 and 18.4 shipped as PART DONE, all three for one reason
// said three ways: none of the owner's seventeen repeating meetings is a
// recorded call, so no transcript existed to bring in, and the lane that built
// the three hunts could not reach the app's own Google connection. What was
// proved was the REFUSAL — "no transcript for this meeting yet" — and the
// arithmetic of a second press. What was never once executed, on any machine,
// was the sentence those three rows are actually about:
//
//     a transcript is found → its words land on the meeting → everybody of OURS
//     who was in the room gets a work log → and the conversation becomes
//     something the knowledge base can answer from, with a citation back to it.
//
// A green build over an unrun write path is the shape this repo has been bitten
// by before (the agent-confirm gap, and route 2's empty transcript). So the
// proof is a FIXTURE rather than a live call, which is the honest substitute:
// the recorded call we do not have is the only thing standing in for it, and
// everything downstream of the file — the hunt, the claim, the work logs, the
// sweep, the answer — is the shipped code running for real against a real
// SQLite database on the real team migrations.
//
// ── WHAT IS FAKED, AND WHAT DELIBERATELY IS NOT
//
// FAKED: Google. `google-api` is the whole of the outside world here — one
// calendar, one Drive, one mailbox, held in `world` below — and `d1-rest` points
// at the in-memory database, exactly as every other suite in this folder does.
//
// NOT FAKED, and this is the difference from `meetings.test.ts`: the HUNT.
// That suite mocks `findTranscript` wholesale, so it proves what `captureTranscript`
// does when something is handed to it and says nothing about whether any route
// can hand it one. Here the real `lib/google-transcript.ts` runs, so each of the
// three routes reaches the write path under its own power — which is precisely
// what 18.3 ("all three routes built… nothing was ingested end to end") is
// missing.
//
// ── THE THREE ROUTES ARE A TABLE, ON PURPOSE
//
// Each is set up so that ONLY that route can succeed: the attachment case has an
// empty Drive and an empty mailbox, the Drive case has no attachment, the mail
// case has neither. A route that quietly stopped working would otherwise be
// covered for by the one before it, which is exactly how route 2 shipped
// returning a document with no words in it.

// GOOGLE WRITES THE NOTES DOCUMENT DURING THE CALL. Ask for it two minutes in
// and it exists, it is readable, and it holds two minutes. `transcript_captured_at`
// meant "do not look again", so whatever had been written by the moment of the
// first read was all this app ever held.
//
// MEASURED, 2026-09-07, on the owner's own `⏩ Week planning`: the meeting row
// holds 1,179 characters ending "Transcription ended after 00:02:30", while the
// same document — finished — holds 73,138 characters and ends at 01:01:00. The
// hour of conversation was in the base, filed by the Drive lane as a separate
// `document`, and the MEETING held a stub of it. Ask "what did we agree in the
// week planning meeting?" and the top passage is a placeholder saying a summary
// was not produced.
//
// THE EARLIER REPAIR HERE FIXED THE NEIGHBOUR. A transcript of ZERO characters
// used to tick the meeting held, and the hunt now proves a candidate is readable
// before claiming it. That is a test of "are there words" and it passes on two
// minutes of them, which is why empty was mended and INCOMPLETE outlived the
// mend. These cases are about the difference.
//
// AND THE LAST CASE IS THE ONE THAT KILLED THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT THIS FIX. The
// obvious repair — re-read the file id already on the row — is wrong, because
// that entry ran as two Meet sessions and Gemini wrote TWO documents: the one
// the meeting claimed was abandoned after three seconds and never grew again.
// A re-read would have returned the same 4,159 bytes for ever and reported
// success. So the refresh HUNTS.
