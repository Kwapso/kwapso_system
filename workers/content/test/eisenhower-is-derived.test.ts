//
// The owner asked whether the workflow that adds or edits a task always
// recalculates the Eisenhower metric. The honest answer is that there is nothing
// to recalculate: the score is a pure function of two booleans, computed on every
// read and stored nowhere. A number that is never written cannot drift from the
// facts it describes.
//
// That answer is only worth having if it stays true, and it can stop being true
// in two quiet ways. Both are asserted here:
//
//   • SOMEBODY STORES IT. A `priority` column added for a filter or a sort would
//     make the score a value somebody has to remember to update, which is the
//     exact class of bug the derivation avoids. The row the door builds is read
//     for it.
//   • THE SQL AND THE FUNCTION DISAGREE. The list's ORDER BY computes the score
//     in SQL — `(important * 2) + urgent` — while the app computes
//     `(important * 2) + urgent + 1`. Same ordering today, because a constant
//     offset cannot reorder anything, and it would stop being the same the moment
//     either half changed shape. So the two are compared across all four
//     combinations rather than trusted to look alike.
