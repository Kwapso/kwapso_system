// R23'S SECOND HALF — THE ANSWER IS WRITTEN, AND IT IS WRITTEN FROM THE PASSAGES.
//
// `cited-answers.test.ts` beside this one proves the DECISION: `found`, `passages`
// and `citations` are settled together, in one seam, and no door assembles them by
// hand. That was the whole law while nothing wrote prose. Now something does, so
// two more things have to be true and neither is provable by reading a comment:
//
//   1. THE WRITER IS HANDED THE PASSAGES AND NOTHING ELSE, and it is told, in the
//      prompt, that they are all it has. A model asked to "answer this question"
//      with some context attached will fill a gap from what it knows about the
//      world; a model told the material IS the world says so instead. The prompt
//      is built by a function, so it can be read here rather than trusted.
//   2. THE PASSAGES ARE FENCED. Half of this material is words a CLIENT wrote — a
//      ticket description, an email body — arriving at a model as part of a prompt.
//      That is the same untrusted text the assistant's tool results carry, reaching
//      a model by a different road, so it carries the same marker, and the marker
//      cannot be closed from inside the payload.
//
// And the model is called ONCE. The owner chose to spend the allowance on this
// screen; "once per question" is the shape of that decision, not an optimisation.
