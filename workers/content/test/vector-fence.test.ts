// LAW R26 — THE VECTOR INDEX NARROWS; THE TEAM'S DATABASE DECIDES.
//
// The knowledge base's search moved out of the per-team database and into one
// account-wide Vectorize index. That trades a structural property for a
// performance one, and the trade is only acceptable because the structure is
// rebuilt twice on the other side. This suite is where that is proved rather
// than asserted, in three parts:
//
//   1. TENANCY IS A PARTITION. Every call into the store carries
//      `namespace: guard.teamId`, built in ONE function from the guard. Read off
//      disk, so a call added later without one is a failing build — and RUN, so
//      a namespace that was passed but ignored is caught too.
//
//   2. NOTHING READABLE COMES BACK. The store is asked for ids and scores:
//      `returnValues: false`, `returnMetadata: "none"`. Every passage in every
//      answer is then read out of the team's own database, under the caller's
//      own owner clause, with excluded sources gone. So a mislabelled vector can
//      cost a relevant passage; it cannot produce one the caller may not read.
//
//   3. THE DATABASE REALLY IS THE DECIDER. A vector whose labels LIE — one that
//      says it is on the team shelf when its source is private, and one whose
//      source has been taken away — is planted in the index, and the answer is
//      checked for it. This is the part a source scan cannot do: it is the
//      difference between "the code looks right" and "wrong labels cannot hurt
//      anybody".
//
// SABOTAGE (each one was run, watched go red, and restored):
//   • delete `namespace: namespaceFor(guard)` from searchVectors → 2 of 7 fail:
//     the source scan, and the run-time check that every query names this team.
//     WORTH SAYING PRECISELY: the cross-team plant still does NOT reach the
//     answer, because the second fence catches it — the chunk is not a row in
//     this team's database, so there is nothing to read. That is the design
//     working, not the test missing it, and it is why the partition can be a
//     performance decision rather than the only thing between two tenants.
//   • change `returnMetadata: "none"` to `"all"` → 2 fail (the scan, and the
//     run-time assertion on what every query asked for).
//   • open the personal fence on retrieve()'s passage read → 2 fail, and the
//     second is the real one: "expected [ 'My note on the renewal' ] to not
//     include 'My note on the renewal'" — a colleague's answer citing another
//     member's private note.
//   • let an excluded source back into that read → 2 fail, the second being
//     "expected [ 'Old pricing, withdrawn' ] to not include 'Old pricing,
//     withdrawn'" — material somebody deliberately took away, answering again.
