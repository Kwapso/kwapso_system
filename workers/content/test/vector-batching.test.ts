// THE WRITE HALF OF THE VECTOR CONTRACT — a batch is only correct against a limit.
//
// `knowledge-vectors.ts` sends its writes in batches, and the loop that does it
// has always been right. The NUMBER was wrong: 200 ids per delete against a
// service that accepts 100, carried by a comment that said "same ceiling, same
// reasoning" about an endpoint with a different ceiling. Vectorize takes 1,000
// vectors per upsert and exactly 100 ids per delete.
//
// It shipped because nothing here was measuring a limit. The stand-in
// implemented the search contract exactly — a namespace really does partition,
// metadata really is withheld — and implemented the write contract not at all:
// `deleteByIds` took an array of any length and did the sensible thing with it.
// Every suite in this folder exercised the batching loop, and none of them could
// tell 100 from 200 from a million, because both batch sizes leave the index in
// precisely the same state. The only difference is the number of CALLS, which
// nothing recorded.
//
// So this suite asserts on the calls, and the stand-in now refuses an oversized
// one exactly as the service does. What it cost: a source with 110 pieces threw
// `VECTOR_DELETE_ERROR (code = 40007)` and took the whole re-index down with it,
// so the knowledge base stopped rebuilding on the first big document while every
// small one kept working.
//
// SABOTAGE (run, watched go red, restored):
//   • DELETE_BATCH back to 200 → "the delete of a source bigger than one batch"
//     fails with the service's own words: too many ids in payload; max id count
//     is 100, got 110. Which is the production error, in a test, before a deploy.
//   • drop the `for` loop in deleteVectors and pass `ids` straight through →
//     same failure. The loop and the constant are checked together, because
//     either one alone is the bug.
//   • UPSERT_BATCH to 1001 → "an upsert never exceeds what Vectorize accepts"
//     fails. That limit has never been breached in production; it is here so the
//     next person to change a batch size finds out from a test.
