// She said it more than any other thing: today she can click a ticket into any
// state, and marking a story "in progress" starts a timer. She wanted that
// inverted, so the status REPORTS what happened and what happened is that
// somebody started working. CHECKLIST 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 6.7 and 5.12 are the five
// sentences that come out of it, and this suite is the four of them a scan cannot
// see plus the one that is a scan.
//
// BEHAVIOURAL, against a real SQLite database running the real team migrations,
// driven through the SHIPPED route handlers — because every rule here is about
// what happens WHEN, and a source scan can only see what is written.
//
// R17 IS THE LOAD-BEARING HALF of all four automatic moves, and it is asserted on
// every one of them: a second trigger must move zero rows, write no second
// history line and (the one that matters to a client watching) re-sort nothing.
