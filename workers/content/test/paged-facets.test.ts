// FILTERING A LIST THAT PAGES — and the only demonstration that means anything.
//
// THE REPORT, in the owner's hands on 18 Aug 2026: filter the knowledge base by
// "From a meeting" and it answers TWO. The door, asked properly, answers 52. The
// app holds 170 meetings. Nothing had crashed and nothing looked wrong: the
// library's frame filters the array it is HOLDING, page one happened to carry
// exactly two meetings, and the screen reported two — under a badge (R16)
// correctly counting all 3,000-odd sources.
//
// So a test that filters fifty loaded rows and finds the right ones proves
// nothing whatsoever about that bug: fifty rows correctly narrowed is exactly
// what the broken version already did. The whole question is whether the answer
// can reach past the cursor.
//
// This file therefore insists on ONE thing, over and over: A ROW THAT IS NOT ON
// PAGE ONE IS FOUND BY THE FACET. Sixty sources, PAGE_SIZE fifty, and the only
// meeting in the base is the sixtieth — unreachable by any amount of filtering in
// the browser. Its siblings say the same sentence about the search box
// (paged-search.test.ts) and about the order (paged-sort.test.ts); this is the
// third control on the same collection and the third time it was found the hard
// way.
//
// Driven through the SHIPPED route handlers against a real SQLite database, like
// both of them, because a filter is three things that must agree — the rows'
// WHERE, the COUNT's WHERE (R16), and the keyset predicate that walks the rest of
// them — and only a real walk proves they do.
