// THE AGENCY'S OWN HOUSEKEEPING — the invariants the four internal modules add
// that nothing else in the base already holds.
//
// Three groups, and they are in this order because that is their order of
// consequence:
//
//   1. A DATE IS A DAY OR IT IS A REFUSAL. Four of the six internal tables carry
//      a date somebody types, and a value that NEARLY parses is the worst kind
//      of bad data: it sorts, it renders, and it is wrong. An expiry that half
//      parses is a certificate that silently never lapses.
//   2. A LINK IS NOT A SCRIPT. These tables store URLs somebody clicks.
//   3. NONE OF IT REACHES A CLIENT — structurally, the way R24 makes the same
//      promise about margin: not by a condition somebody can invert, but by the
//      doors not being on the client's surface and the client's app not naming
//      the tables. A profile saying what a colleague is bad at is the sharpest
//      case of agency-only material in the app.
