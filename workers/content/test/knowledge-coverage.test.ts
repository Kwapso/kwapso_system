// WHAT THE KNOWLEDGE BASE ACTUALLY KNOWS ABOUT A CLIENT.
//
// The complaint this suite exists for, in the owner's own words: "if I'm asking
// about a particular account, the knowledge base should be able to dig through
// everything: from sales to scope to work blocks to tickets to stories to all
// engagement types… any row ID that has the client ID on it must have or should
// have been indexed. I should have gotten a clear answer with the ability to go
// and check out the links to the sources or to those particular records."
//
// He tested two real accounts on staging. Both answers were thin, and the whole
// of what the base knew about one of them was:
//
//     "Bergman S.A. Bergman S.A. is a company we work with. Reference BERG.
//      Status: active_client."
//
// SO THIS SUITE IS ABOUT ANSWER QUALITY, not about which kinds exist. A test
// asserting `INGEST_KINDS` contains "process" would pass with a reader that
// indexed the word "process" and nothing else — which is exactly the failure
// being repaired. Every assertion below is either a REAL ANSWER to a question a
// person would type, or the TEXT a kind really produced, read back out of the
// database the sweep wrote.
//
// Four things it holds:
//   1. COVERAGE — every table that can carry an account id becomes a source,
//      in that account's compartment, through one sweep of the one engine.
//   2. RICHNESS — the account rollup names the client's world; the map names its
//      steps; a thin record says what it IS rather than padding.
//   3. THE LINK BACK — every passage that mirrors a record carries the path to
//      it, and every path names a page this app really has.
//   4. THE FENCES DID NOT MOVE — no switch-gated figure reaches the index, and a
//      text-builder change really does force a re-walk instead of being skipped.

  // re-indexing and the version must not move.
  // RE-PINNED AGAIN 1 Sep 2026, AT THE SAME VERSION, for the SECOND time and the
  // same reason as the first. `task` was the last kind in the table, so its slice
  // ran to the table's closing bracket; three kinds now follow it, so the slice
  // ends where `person` begins. The measurement moved and the reader did not —
  // the task builder is byte for byte what it was — so nothing needs re-indexing
  // and the version must not move. That this keeps happening to whichever kind is
  // declared last is worth knowing before reaching for a bump.

  // R47's three (1 Sep 2026). Every one starts at v1 because no row of them has
  // ever been indexed — there is nothing behind a cursor to leave saying the old
  // words.
  // v2: a client login is not a colleague — R21 makes one an ordinary team
  // member holding an ordinary role, so `team_members` alone cannot tell them
  // apart and three client contacts on staging were filed as colleagues within
  // minutes of v1 landing. The live portal grant is the fact that separates
  // them, and the bump is what walks the cursor back over the rows already
  // written.
  // v3: the SENTENCE, not the fact — "a client contact for Test client" rather
  // than "a person at a client of ours FOR Test client, client". Only visible on
  // a live row, which is where it was found, minutes after v2 shipped.
  // RE-PINNED AT 3 on 4 Sep 2026 — the fourth time this has been a false alarm,
  // and worth saying why precisely. `Full Name (email)` as the title was built,
  // measured and BACKED OUT: `indexableText` is `title + body`, so an address
  // puts its DOMAIN into every colleague-at-a-client's searchable text, and
  // "what is currently happening with the Bergman dispatch rollout?" promptly
  // answered out of two contacts at bergman.example. The reader's CODE is now
  // byte-identical to v3 (`git diff` shows no non-comment line); what it gained
  // is the note recording that negative result. `stripComments` blanks a
  // comment's text and KEEPS its newline, so a long note still moves the hash —
  // which is why the version stays at 3, nothing is re-indexed, and only the
  // digest is re-pinned.
  // Re-pinned on the 10 Sep 2026 merge with the knowledge-base rebuild, which
  // rewrote this kind's note on the other line. The reader's TEXT is untouched
  // by both lines — hence version 3, unmoved — so this is a comment-only re-pin
  // of the kind the header above already describes.

  // for them unless they change it." Nothing in this app pre-selects a value
  // from that flag — its one behavioural read anywhere is the refusal in
  // `setSelectableActive` — and because every seeded row and every migration
  // back-fill sets it, `MAX()` returned the alphabetically last live value, so
  // the sentence named an arbitrary word AND claimed a behaviour that does not
  // exist. It now states the true fact, which is a COUNT: how many of the list's
  // choices are protected, and that protection is not a pre-selection. Every
  // dropdown source already in the base says the old words, which is exactly the
  // case the version mechanism exists for, so this one really must move.
  // Digest re-pinned (not the version) on the 10 Sep 2026 merge: the other line
  // gave every kind a `generatedOnly` flag, which is metadata about the row and

/** Everything in the sweep that is NOT inside a kind: the shared helpers each
 * reader leans on. Pinned once, for the reason the check above states. */
// UPDATED 20 Aug 2026 for the sweep ORDER, which changes no kind's text.
// `sweepKinds` now walks the lanes oldest-swept first instead of in declaration
// order, because the Drive lane grew long enough to starve the ones behind it
// (document had run 194 times to message's 180, and the gap widened every tick).
// Which lane goes first is not something any kind SAYS, so no textVersion moves.
// 26 Aug 2026: the sweep gained its activity line (a feed entry when it filed
// passages) — an APPEND after the loop, no reader touched, so again no
// textVersion moves. Later the same day: the machine-actor attribution
// literals ('kwapso' as creator/deactivator) moved onto the brand seam —
// column VALUES, not words any kind says.
// 27 Aug 2026: the loop learned to UNDO a retirement it made itself — a source
// the app retired is revived and rebuilt when its row comes back, while one a
// person excluded stays excluded (`deactivator_id` is the seam). That decides
// WHETHER a source is indexed, never a word of what any kind says, so again no
// textVersion moves — and a bump here would be actively wrong: it would re-index
// every row of every kind to fix nothing.
// 1 Sep 2026: `IngestKind.read` gained a fifth argument (the global core
// database, for the `person` kind — membership is global and `staff_profiles`
// carries no name), `IngestKind` gained `modules` (R47), `oneSourcePer` (what
// one source of a kind IS, where it is not one row) and `fromCoreDatabase` (its
// rows are not in the team's database at all), and `nameSpellings` landed beside
// the other helpers. None of the three changes a WORD any existing
// kind says: the ten readers that were here before pass the new argument nowhere
// and call the new helper never, and every one of their per-kind digests above
// is unchanged except `task`, whose slice merely moved (see its note). So no
// textVersion moves, and a bump here would re-index the whole base to fix
// nothing.
// 6 Sep 2026: an unembeddable source stops being retried (EMBED_ATTEMPT_CAP).
// Three edits, all of them about WHETHER a source is sent to the model and none
// about what it SAYS: the upsert clears `embed_attempts` when a row's title or
// body changes, the loop skips a source that has failed the cap and reports the
// set once, and `indexSource` counts the attempt in the branch that already
// blanked the hash. Not one reader was touched, and every per-kind digest above
// is unchanged — which is the evidence, not the claim: this pin was the ONLY
// one that moved. So no textVersion moves, and a bump here would re-read every
// row of every kind to fix nothing.
// 6 Sep 2026, again: ONE IMPORT LINE, and no reader's words moved with it.
// `ticketTypeKeptForMigrationExcludedSql` (shared/types.ts) is now imported at
// the top of the file, which sits outside the kinds table and so lands in this
// digest. The only reader that CALLS it is `account`, whose own pin above moved
// to v3 in the same change and carries the reason. Every other per-kind digest
// is unchanged — which is the evidence rather than the claim — so no other
// textVersion moves, and bumping one here would re-read every row of every kind
// to fix nothing.
// 7 Sep 2026: THE RULER MOVED, NOT THE FILE. `stripComments`
// (shared/rules/source-scan.ts) stopped being two regexes and became a real
// tokeniser, and it now leaves a block comment's NEWLINES behind instead of
// closing the file up onto one line — so every line below a `/* … */` keeps its
// number. `knowledge-ingest.ts` was not one of the files the old stripper was
// mis-reading (its stripped text is identical word for word, whitespace aside),
// so nothing this digest is ABOUT has changed: no reader says anything new, no
// per-kind digest above moved, and no textVersion moves. Re-pinned at the new
// measurement, exactly as the 20 Aug note above records doing.
// 8 Sep 2026: TWO COLUMNS ON THE UPSERT, AND NOT A WORD ON ANY ROW. The insert
// carries `event_id` / `event_id_from` (migration
// `0070_a_source_says_which_call_it_is_from`) and `IngestRow` gained the two
// optional fields that feed them. Both sit outside the kinds table and so land
// here. They are a PARENT, not a sentence: neither reaches `title`, `summary` or
// `body`, nothing that goes to the index or to the model moved, and the one
// per-kind digest that moved with this change (`meeting`, above) moved because
// its SELECT gained a column — its own words are byte for byte what they were,
// which its note records. Every other per-kind digest is unchanged, which is the
// evidence rather than the claim. So no textVersion moves, and a bump here would
// re-read every row of every kind to rewrite none of them.
// 9 Sep 2026: A ROW POINTS AT A DIFFERENT CALL AND STILL SAYS THE SAME WORDS.
// The sweep now settles a recurring occurrence's event id onto the call the base
// actually holds (`settledEvent`, knowledge-google.ts): the owner's Jourfix moved
// from 10:00 to 10:30, so Google's own id for it changed, and 37 artefacts on
// staging pointed at a call under the OTHER stamp. That resolution touches
// `eventId` and nothing else — not `title`, not `summary`, not `body` — so
// nothing reaching the index or the model moved, and no per-kind digest above
// moved either, which is the evidence rather than the claim. A textVersion bump
// would be actively wrong here: the upsert writes `event_id` on EVERY pass
// (COALESCE keeps the old value only where the new one is null), so the fix
// lands without re-reading a single row's text, and a bump would re-embed the
// whole base to change one column. Re-pinned, exactly as the notes above record.
// RE-PINNED AGAIN, 2026-09-10: `catchUp()` (knowledge-ingest.ts) now calls
// `recordWorkerError` when a kind's sweep fails, closing the gap where that
// path — the one that runs in front of a live question — recorded a failure
// nowhere but its own `knowledge_ingest` row. Nothing about what any kind
// SAYS moved: the change is to error reporting, not to a reader, and no
// per-kind digest above moved either, which is the evidence rather than the
// claim. A textVersion bump would be actively wrong here for the same reason
// the note above gives — it would re-embed the whole base to change zero
// words of anyone's indexed text.
// RE-PINNED AGAIN, 2026-09-11 (d-ingest-filing): `sweepKind`'s upsert now
// writes an `accounts` column — the filing half of BUILD-5 §1, Gmail and
// Calendar's full contact match kept instead of discarded past the first
// hit (google-read.ts's `matchedAccounts`). It is a PARENT, not a sentence:
// the write reaches no `title`, `summary` or `body` anywhere, only a JSON
// array of ids alongside them, and every one of the 13 per-kind digests
// above is unchanged — the 13 mirrored kinds never set `row.accounts` at
// all, so their upsert runs exactly as it did. A textVersion bump would be
// actively wrong here for the same reason the notes above give: it would
// re-embed the whole base to change zero words of anyone's indexed text.

// WHAT IT COST. Asked "what came out of the Team Assembly?" the base returned
// six passages and six citations, every one a 2027 placeholder reading "🧡 Team
// Assembly is a meeting of ours, on 2027-05-19.", and the 92-chunk transcript of
// the real August meeting was not among them. The retrieval bench scored that
// PASS, because a placeholder and the transcript HAVE THE SAME TITLE. No ranking
// separates them either — "Team Assembly is a meeting of ours" is a near-perfect
