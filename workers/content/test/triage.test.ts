// TRIAGE — whose week it is, and what has been sitting (.plans/BUILD-1 §6).
//
// The two sentences the suite holds:
//   • ONE named person per week, enforced by the database rather than by a check
//     two writers race past;
//   • three days, counted from when the request was RAISED, over tickets nobody
//     has read — and never, on any door, visible to the client whose request it
//     is. That last one is the difference between an internal prompt and a
//     service-level promise nobody made.

/** Raise a ticket and back-date it by `days` WORKING days, which is the only
 * way to make a "has been sitting" test about anything other than the clock.
 *
 * IT USED TO BACK-DATE BY CALENDAR DAYS, and that made this suite pass or fail
 * depending on WHICH DAY IT WAS RUN. The triage door moved onto working days on
 * 2026-09-06 (the client: "saturday and sunday do not count towards how long it
 * took") and this helper was left behind, so the fixture and the door were
 * measuring in different units. Subtracting four calendar days from a Monday
 * lands on the Thursday before — two working days, not four — so every case
 * about the three-day line flipped its answer over a weekend. Green when it was
 * written, red the following Monday, and nothing in the diff to explain it.
 *
 * `workingDaysAgo` is the exact inverse of the `workingDaysBetween` the door
 * counts with, so a ticket aged N here is a ticket the door reports as N,
 * whatever day the suite runs. */
