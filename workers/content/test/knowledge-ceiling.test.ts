// THE FIVE PROMISES THE KNOWLEDGE BASE MAKES ABOUT BIG, MOVING MATERIAL — each
// one a thing the old design got wrong, and each one broken here to prove the
// test bites.
//
//   1. NO SILENT TRIM. A document past the ceiling is REFUSED, in words, saying
//      both numbers, and NOTHING is saved. The owner's ruling: "if a limit must
//      remain, the upload is REFUSED with a clear message, never silently
//      trimmed." The old door capped the body at TEXT_LIMITS.long — twenty
//      thousand characters, about eight pages — which is why two whole books
//      came back refused and a 300-page contract could not go in at all.
//
//   2. A BIG DOCUMENT GOES IN WHOLE, in slices, and is answerable from any part
//      of it — not just the first two hundred chunks the old chunker stopped at.
//
//   3. A SOURCE THAT LEFT THE APP LEAVES THE ANSWERS. An archived ticket used to
//      be skipped by the sweep's read, which meant the cursor never visited it
//      again and its indexed copy answered questions forever.
//
//   4. THE ANSWER CHECKS THE LIVE ROW. A ticket that was "new" when it was
//      indexed and is "resolved" now must not be quoted as new.
//
//   5. A RE-INDEX SURVIVES BEING RUN TWICE. A chunk's id is derived from its
//      source and its position, so the same slice re-run computes the same ids —
//      and the write used to be a plain INSERT, which meant a re-index that
//      overlapped itself died on `UNIQUE constraint failed: knowledge_chunks.id`
//      rather than overwriting. Thirty-six of them on staging on 2026-08-18, from
//      a backfill running beside the fifteen-minute cron.
//
// SABOTAGE — each was applied, watched go red, and restored. The exact red is
// recorded beside each test.
