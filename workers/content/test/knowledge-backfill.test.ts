// THE BACKFILL, MEASURED — the knowledge base built over the agency's OWN
// history (1,820 tickets and 123 accounts out of the two Glide apps this product
// replaces), through the shipped sweep door, against a real SQLite database
// running the real team migrations.
//
// The 223 legacy ARTICLES are no longer part of this fixture. Learning was
// purged on 17 Aug 2026 and its table with it; the articles that had already
// been indexed live on as sources with kind `article`, which is why lib
// knowledge.ts keeps that kind with no sweep behind it.
//
// WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT A SCRIPT. Two jobs, one fixture:
//   • it MEASURES — chunks, index size, time, embedding tokens, and a real
//     retrieval score with the protocol written down, because ".plans" asks for
//     "the retrieval quality you actually measured (not an impression)";
//   • it PROVES the pipeline survives real data — German and English in one row,
//     empty bodies, 5,100-character walls of pasted text, 11 tickets with no
//     client at all. A synthetic fixture cannot fail in any of those ways.
//
// IT SKIPS ITSELF when glide/normalised.json is absent, which is everywhere
// except a machine that has pulled the customer data (it is git-ignored, and it
// must never be committed). So `npm run check` is unaffected on any other
// machine, and the numbers below are reproducible on one that has it.
//
// THE VECTOR STAGE IS OFF for the score. Workers AI is a binding, so there is no
// model here; the fake returns nothing and every embedding stores as NULL. That
// makes the number a FLOOR — the lexical stage alone, which is the stage that
// decides which chunks the vector stage is even allowed to re-rank. Measuring
// the blend would need the real model against real spend, which belongs on
// staging, not in a test.
