// STAFF ANONYMITY IS ONE PROMISE, AND IT IS KEPT ON EVERY SURFACE THAT LEAVES
// THE BUILDING — proved against a real SQLite database through the shipped doors.
//
// SCOPE ch.06: "the portal shows work status but never which staff member is
// doing it." `listReplies` kept that on the wire by blanking the author's NAME,
// and left the author's ID — a stable per-person handle on every ticket that
// person ever touches. A pseudonym is anonymity right up until something links it
// to a name once, and the reply notification did exactly that: same person's
// inbox, same reply, "Staff replied to your support ticket." Two green halves in
// front of a live linkage.
//
// The second suite here is the other thing a ticket was a key to: the staff
// DIRECTORY. The stakeholder set derives the team's admins and resolves them to
// name, email address and photograph — reachable with `help:read` and a ticket
// id. Every other name in that set is a property of the TICKET; the admins are a
// property of the role table, which is R18's sentence in a module that had not
// heard it.
//
// The third is the TICKET ITSELF, and it is the largest of the three by volume.
// `listReplies` redacted a thread's authors while `toTicket`, forty lines above
// it, emitted `raiserId`, `raiserName` and `editorName` with no portal branch at
// all — so every row of a client's support list named the staff member who
// raised it and the one who last touched it. Staff raise a client's questions
// for them (SCOPE ch.07): 220 of the 221 seeded historical requests are
// staff-raised, which makes this the majority case rather than an edge. The
// portal's own screen has carried a note about it for weeks
// (web-portal/components/support-screen.tsx) saying the decision belonged on the
// server, next to the one the thread already made.
