// A TICKET DOES NOT LEAVE `new` UNTIL IT SAYS WHAT IT IS ABOUT.
//
// The owner's ruling, 19 Aug 2026: "A ticket must always be linked to a client
// or app before being triaged. If that is not the case, then let it be in a
// pre-triage or draft state. Only when I assign it a client app and who made
// the ticket, and all of the fields that are already required, can it go into a
// triage state."
//
// NO NEW STATUS WAS ADDED, and this suite is where that decision is defended.
// `new` has always meant "raised, and nobody here has read it yet", which is the
// same sentence as "pre-triage" — a `draft` beside it would be two names for one
// place, and every filter, digest, screen and machine tool that knows `new`
// would have had to learn the second one. What was missing was never the STATE.
// It was the REASON: a ticket sat there with a button that would fail and
// nothing on the row saying why. So the gate REPORTS its gaps, and this asserts
// both halves — the refusal, and the naming.
//
// It is checked in the model rather than at the door because there is more than
// one way to reach `markTriaged` (the triage screen, the agent, an MCP tool),
// and one of them will be written by somebody who has never read the route file.
