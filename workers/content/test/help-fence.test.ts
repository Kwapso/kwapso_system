// THE HELP BURGLAR — a client login attacking the support doors, against a real
// SQLite database running the real team migrations. The source-scan suites
// (web-portal/test/portal-fence.test.ts) prove no portal-reachable read is BUILT
// without a fence; this one proves the fence actually holds, by driving the
// shipped route handlers and reading what comes back.
//
// It exists because a scan cannot catch a call site that passes the wrong value
// on purpose, and because the leak that earned it was in a RESPONSE, not a query:
// `POST /api/content/help` raised a ticket and answered with `ticketPage(…)`,
// whose `portal` argument defaulted to false. A client asking their first
// question was handed every other client's tickets — description text, raiser
// names and all — on the happy path, with no crafted request at all.
//
// The burglar's role holds EVERY help right. Their role is not what stops them;
// if they get through, the fence itself is broken.

// THE AGENCY'S OWN MATERIAL IS NOT SERVED TO A CLIENT LOGIN.

// The account fence answers "which of these rows are theirs". Some doors have no
// such answer, because nothing behind them belongs to any client: the agency's
// own brand material, why it meets, and its dropdown vocabulary. The client
// portal's gateway already refuses them by not naming them — and its own comment
// says why ("publishing them here would be a disclosure, not a feature"). But the
// AGENCY origin serves the same doors to the same person, and a client login is
// an ordinary team member by construction, so the module right alone let them
// through: the whole library, and a full-field CSV export of it.
//
// EARNED ON THE LEARNING LIBRARY, which is no longer in the app. The module was
// purged on 17 Aug 2026 and the doors named below are its successors on the same
// footing — the finding was never about articles, it was about a door with no
// fence and no refusal.
