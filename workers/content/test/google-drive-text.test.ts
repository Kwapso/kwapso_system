// WHAT ONE UNREADABLE FILE MAY COST.
//
// A named Drive folder is somebody ELSE'S material. It holds files whose owner
// switched downloading off, Shared Drive items under a retention rule, files
// Google has flagged. Google answers 403 for THAT FILE and 200 for the forty
// beside it — so "one file refused" is the ordinary case, not the exception.
//
// On 2026-08-17 a real folder's sweep indexed NOTHING and recorded "Google
// wouldn't allow that any more — connect it again in Settings." against a grant
// that was perfectly alive: `driveFileText` threw on a per-file 403, and the
// loop in google-read.ts has no catch, so the first refused file took every
// readable file with it. Gmail, Calendar and Chat — which have no per-item
// content fetch that can 403 — indexed 25, 25 and 2 in the same minute. The
// error message blamed the person's Google account for our own control flow.
//
// THE DISTINCTION THIS SUITE LOCKS. The metadata call that runs first goes
// through `googleFetch`, which already throws `google_access_lost` on 401/403.
// So by the time the download runs, the token is PROVEN good on this very file:
// a 403 there is about the FILE, and the honest answer is the one the function
// already gives an image or a zip — nothing to read. A 401 is different and
// still throws, because that is a token dying mid-loop, which somebody must be
// told about rather than have silently turn forty files into empty strings.
