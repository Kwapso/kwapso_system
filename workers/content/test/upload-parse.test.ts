// ── WHAT AN ATTACHMENT DOOR STORES, AND WHY IT CAN NOW TAKE ANYTHING ────────
//
// THE OWNER, 26 Aug 2026: attaching an .md to a ticket answered "That file
// didn't come through. Try again, up to 10MB." It was 4KB. The refusal was the
// TYPE — ticket and story attachments took inline-safe media only — and the
// sentence blamed a size that was never the problem, so the obvious next move
// (shrink the file) could never work.
//
// The narrow list guarded something real: the gateway serves an attachment back
// under its declared type on the SAME origin as the app, so a `text/html`
// upload is stored XSS. The knowledge base had already answered it the right
// way round — the boundary is HOW THE BYTES ARE STORED, not which are accepted.
