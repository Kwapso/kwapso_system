// THE NUMBERS ON TOP OF A RECORD'S TIME — the aggregate door the Work logs tab
// draws, driven through the SHIPPED route handler against a real SQLite database
// running the real team migrations.
//
// FIVE THINGS ARE WORTH LOCKING, and every one of them is a way this door could
// be quietly wrong while the screen above it looks perfectly finished:
//
//   1. IT REFUSES A CLIENT LOGIN (R21). A work log names the staff member who did
//      the work and how long they took — both halves of what SCOPE ch.06 keeps
//      off the client's side — and the door sits at the agency origin where an
//      ordinary Client-role session can reach it.
//
//   2. IT NARROWS TO THE RECORD IT WAS ASKED ABOUT. The screen shows this on ONE
//      record's tab, so a filter that quietly fell through would put the whole
//      agency's hours under a single ticket, with a completely plausible chart
//      on top of them.
//
//   3. THE HEADLINE FIGURES ARE THE LIST'S OWN FIGURES (R16). They come from the
//      same `countWorkLogs` the paged list door uses, so the badge and the header
//      cannot disagree — asserted by reading BOTH doors and comparing.
//
//   4. THE BREAKDOWNS COUNT SECONDS, NOT ROWS, AND KEEP THE UNNAMED BUCKET.
//      Most logged time carries no `kind` at all; a GROUP BY that dropped NULL
//      would draw a picture of the minority and label it the whole.
//
//   5. BINNED TIME IS NOT TIME. A discarded runaway timer is an hour somebody
//      deliberately threw away, and it must not appear in any of the four
//      figures — which is the same clause `logWhere` opens with, proved here
//      rather than assumed.
