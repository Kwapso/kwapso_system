// THE KNOWLEDGE BASE, END TO END, against a real SQLite database running the
// real team migrations — the shipped route handlers, the shipped SQL, the
// shipped guard corridor. Only two things are stubbed: the D1 REST transport
// (pointed at the in-memory database) and the embedding model.
//
// WHY THE MODEL IS FAKED, AND WHAT THAT COSTS. `env.AI` here returns a
// deterministic bag-of-words vector, so a chunk about invoices really is closer
// to a question about invoices than to one about logos. What that proves is the
// PIPELINE — embed on write, store quantised, decode on read, blend with the
// lexical score, rank — which is the part that can silently break. What it does
// not prove is Workers AI's semantics; that is measured separately, on the
// agency's own history, by scripts/knowledge-backfill.mjs.
//
// FOUR THINGS THIS SUITE IS ACTUALLY FOR:
//   • a client login cannot reach ONE door of this module (R21), whatever their
//     role says — their role here holds every knowledge right on purpose;
//   • an answer names its sources, and an answer with none says so (R23);
//   • the compartment is DERIVED, and a question about one client does not come
//     back carrying another client's material;
//   • taking a source away really takes it away — and the sweep does not quietly
//     put it back.

// question", which for a two-word question is one word. Any chunk saying "capital"
// was, arithmetically, half an answer about France.
//
// The corpus below is built to make that leak happen: one source contains one of
// the two words, the other contains the other, and neither contains both. Under the
// old floor each of them cleared it on its own.
//
// NOTHING IS CLOSE ENOUGH is set here rather than hoped for. The trigger is
// `vector.length === 0`, which retrieve() reaches by four routes it treats
// identically — no store bound, the question could not be embedded, the material
// has no vector, or nothing clears the relevance floor. Staging took the last one,
// so this suite takes it too, by putting the floor out of the stand-in model's
// reach. Leaving it at the suite default would measure that model's accidental
// collisions (a two-word question and a two-word account name share a hashed slot
// often enough) rather than this floor.

//   "What was decided in the Ishita and Alaap meeting?"     -> 3 passages

// with nothing, because the two searches read different things — the router
// reads record COVERS (a title and a summary, a short text about the whole

// backwards on the one thing the word match exists for. Measured on staging: a
// question about ticket 3144 returned zero candidates, because the chunk that
// says "3144 is pending gravity forms confirmation" holds the one token that
// matters and three others, against a floor of eight. Phrasing the question more
// fully made the reference HARDER to find, which is the opposite of what a person
// doing it expects.
//
// So an exact token waives the proportion — and only a RARE one does, because a
// year is a digit-bearing token too and there are hundreds of chunks with one in
// them. Both halves are here: without the second, the sole-evidence path (where
// the word match decides `found` on its own) would answer every question that
