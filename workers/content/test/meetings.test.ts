// MEETINGS, end to end, against a real SQLite database running the real team
// migrations — the shipped doors, the shipped gate, the shipped SQL. Only the D1
// REST transport is stubbed (pointed at the in-memory database), plus Google
// itself for the one door that reaches into a calendar.
//
// FIVE THINGS THIS SUITE IS FOR:
//   • a client login cannot reach ONE door of this module (R21), whatever their
//     role says — their role here holds every meeting right on purpose;
//   • a repeat is silent (R17): cancelling a cancelled meeting moves zero rows
//     and writes no second line of history;
//   • the meetings list PAGES (R14) and its badge is the exact server count (R16);
//   • THE CALENDAR IS READ-ONLY. Not one door in this app writes to Google's
//     calendar, and the suite asserts that by asking the seven that used to and
//     getting nothing back;
//   • READING A TRANSCRIPT TWICE DOES NOT DOUBLE ANYBODY'S HOURS. The claim
//     rides `transcript_captured_at IS NULL` and always did — which is why
//     retiring the `held` status could not weaken it — and this suite proves it
//     rather than trusting the reading.
