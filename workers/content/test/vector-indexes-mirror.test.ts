// A FRESH ENVIRONMENT BUILT WRONG, UNDER A GREEN BUILD.
//
// Vectorize will not index retrospectively: an index created without a
// metadata property can never filter on it, and the fix is to rebuild the
// index and re-embed everything. BOOTSTRAP.md's setup block creates them one
// `wrangler` line at a time, and it mirrors `METADATA_INDEXES` (beside
// `VectorLabels`) BY HAND — which the doc says out loud, because until now
// nothing read that constant at all. So a tenth label could be added to the
// code, shipped green, and the next environment stood up without it: the
// failure would surface months later as a filter that silently matches
// nothing, on data that has to be re-embedded to fix.
//
// This is the check the docstring used to promise. Named by the round-three
// lean review as the highest consequence per point on its list.
