// THE SENTENCE THE WHOLE CHANGE RESTS ON — "why am I not able to create related
// stories from inside a ticket? How else will I get this to a triaged state?" —
// driven through the SHIPPED doors against a real SQLite database.
//
// He is right, and the arithmetic is worth pinning down because it is the reason
// the missing button was a LIFECYCLE bug rather than a convenience one. A ticket
// with no stories against it can be READ (`triaged`, which is one person opening
// it) and can go no further, ever: `scheduled` asks for a story on this ticket
// that is booked into a sprint, `in_progress` is a timer starting on one, and
// `ready` is the last one closing. Every stage after triage is a STORY doing
// something, so a request nobody can write work against is a request that stops.
//
// This suite proves both halves — the wall, and the door through it — so nobody
// can quietly take the create action away again and leave a green build behind.
