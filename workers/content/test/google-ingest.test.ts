// GOOGLE MATERIAL BECOMING KNOWLEDGE, end to end, against a real SQLite database
// running the real team migrations — the shipped door, the shipped gate, the
// shipped sweep, the shipped SQL. Three things are stubbed and no more: the D1
// REST transport (pointed at the in-memory database), the embedding model, and
// GOOGLE ITSELF — because the one thing this suite must never need is somebody's
// real mailbox.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR, in one sentence each:
//   • THE SHELF IS THE FENCE. A folder somebody filed as team material answers a
//     colleague; one they kept to themselves answers only them. That is the
//     design round's own answer to "can a colleague get an answer built from a
//     document in YOUR Drive?" — "only if you filed it as team material" — and
//     it is a property of a COLUMN here, not of a habit.
//   • THE COMPARTMENT IS DECIDED, NOT GUESSED. A Drive folder says whose it is
//     because somebody said so when they named it; a mail says whose it is
//     because a known contact is on it. Neither is a client's name matched out
//     of the text.
//   • A CRON CANNOT DO ANY OF THIS. Everything above is read with one person's
//     own token, so the scheduled sweep must not be able to reach these kinds at
//     all — not "would find nothing", which is a silent pass wearing a green
//     tick, but structurally cannot name them.
//   • A CLIENT LOGIN REACHES NO DOOR OF IT (R21).
