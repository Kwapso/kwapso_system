// WHAT WE HAND OVER (CHECKLIST 8.7) — the invariants this module adds, driven
// through the SHIPPED route handlers against a real SQLite database running the
// real team migrations.
//
// Five groups, in order of what it would cost to get each one wrong:
//
//   1. THE ACCOUNT IS COPIED OFF THE APP, never accepted from a caller. This is
//      the fence, and the fence is the whole reason the module can be opened to
//      a client later without a data migration. A caller who could assert an
//      account could file our handover material under somebody else's company —
//      a row that a fenced read would then hand to the wrong client on the day
//      the portal door is opened, which is the worst thing this module could do.
//   2. IT IS ITS OWN SWITCH. `processes` opens the app; it must not open the
//      shelf. A module that turns out to be gated on its neighbour is a
//      permission an owner cannot actually grant.
//   3. THE FIELD RULES a deliverable adds: a date is a real day, a link is one a
//      reader can safely click, and an archive is idempotent (R17).
//   4. WHAT REACHES A CLIENT, AND WHAT STILL DOES NOT. Until 18 August 2026 the
//      answer was "nothing", proved three ways. The owner then opened the shelf
//      with a condition — "the deliverables are for them! but only once we mark
//      it as visible" — so the proof changed shape rather than being deleted:
//      the AGENCY's six doors are still absent from the portal's surface and
//      still refuse a client login, and exactly ONE new door answers a client.
//   5. THE TWO FENCES ON THAT DOOR, which is where the feature actually lives.
//      A client sees their own company's rows AND only the ones somebody marked
//      visible. Both, never either — a row that passes one test and fails the
//      other must be as absent as a row that fails both.
