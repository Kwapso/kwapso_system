// kwapso PORTAL GATEWAY — the CLIENT portal's one public address (SCOPE ch.04,
// "two front doors, one building"). It serves the portal's screens and passes a
// NAMED, closed set of /api calls to the same workers the agency app uses. Same
// origin for screens and brains, so the session cookie just works.
//
// HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM THE AGENCY GATEWAY, and why it matters.
//
// The agency gateway forwards by PREFIX: /api/tenancy/* goes to tenancy, whole.
// That is right for a surface whose users are the agency. It is wrong here. A
// prefix forward on this door would publish EVERY tenancy route to the client
// internet — roles, invites, members, dropdown values, the screen-recipe
// overrides, the admin doors — plus data-ops (import + the assistant) and the
// MCP endpoint. Each of those still gates on a role right, so a prefix forward
// would probably hold. "Probably holds" is not a front door. One misconfigured
// client role, one new route that lands ungated for an hour, and the portal is
// the way in.
//
// So this gateway is an ALLOW-LIST, keyed the way the domain workers key their
// own route tables: `METHOD /path` → the worker behind it. Anything not named
// below is 404, including every /api/data-ops/* and /mcp path. Adding a door to
// the portal is a deliberate line in this file — and the portal-fence test reads
// this table off disk, so a read added here must ALSO carry the account fence
// (shared/workers/account-scope.ts) or the build goes red.
//
// The fence itself is NOT re-implemented here. This worker never decides who may
// see what; it only decides which questions may be asked. Every answer comes
// from a door that already resolves the caller's account set.

// The four things BOTH front doors do identically — refuse a write another site
// started, serve an uploaded file (with its key validated at the boundary and its
// security headers), record a client crash, and answer their own crash without
// leaking a raw 1101. ONE implementation, deliberately: this door's media serving
// was once written a second time from memory and shipped without the key check the
// agency door had carried for weeks.

 *
 * THIS EXACT FAULT SHIPPED TWICE. The agency door had it on 17 Aug 2026 — the

 * fixed and locked with a test the same day. The portal was never given that
 * test, and its array still read `/support/*`, a path that appears NOWHERE in
 * this codebase but here. So the handler forwarded /tickets/* and the asset
 * layer 404'd it first, and the only reason it looked fine is that clicking a
 * ticket in the app never leaves the page. A RELOAD, a pasted link, and every
 * ticket-notification email a client has ever received all landed on the 404
 * page (shared/workers/record-link.ts builds them as `/tickets/<id>`).
