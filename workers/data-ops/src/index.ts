// kwapso DATA-OPS worker — bulk data import today (the AI agent brain lands here

/**
 * THE LIVE-SYNC SEAM (locked, CACHING.md "Every mutation publishes"). Every route is
 * classified so a new one CAN'T be added without consciously deciding how it goes live
 * (publish-seam.test.ts enforces it):
 *   • "read"        — a GET; changes nothing, broadcasts nothing.
 *   • "mutation"    — a write other clients can see, so it MUST broadcast a ping.
 *   • "housekeeping" — the reviewed deny-list: a write that intentionally broadcasts
 *                      NOTHING. The import batch steps (draft/file/plan) only shape
 *                      the CALLER's own batch, returned synchronously in the same
 *                      response — no other screen needs a ping. The owner seed writes
 *                      the global catalog (no team channel). Only confirm, which
 *                      actually creates rows in a shared table, broadcasts.
