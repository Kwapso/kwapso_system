// The import CATALOGUE (which tables this team may import into, in the global core DB)

// — session → upload → mapping → preview → confirm, one table at a time — is gone: the
// agentic batch engine (lib/import-batch.ts) replaced it on every surface, and its five
// doors had no caller left at all. What survives is what BOTH the batch engine and the
// picker still need:
//   • the catalogue — self-healing on read (R13), so a fresh environment can import;
//   • writeRow — one mapped row written through the target's own GATED create endpoint,
//     act-as-user (the caller's cookie is forwarded), so every imported row respects the
//     caller's permissions and the module's validation exactly like a typed-in one.
