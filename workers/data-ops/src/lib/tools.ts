// The agent's TOOL CATALOG (opt-in: an action is a tool ONLY if it's here) and the
// act-as-user EXECUTOR. Every tool maps to a gated endpoint the UI already uses;
// executing it forwards the caller's session cookie, so the real door re-checks their
// permission and validates the input — the agent can never exceed the invoker's rights.
//
// The ~two dozen tenancy/content CRUD tools are DECLARED ONCE in the shared catalog
// (`shared/workers/tool-catalog.ts`) and shared with the MCP surface — this file
// PROJECTS each shared endpoint into an AgentTool (adding the model-facing description +
// confirm rule + step summary via `toAgentTool`), then adds the agent-ONLY tools below
// (reads/bulk/import that the MCP doesn't expose, and the SELF import-batch runner).
//
// SAFETY (locked):
//   • Act-as-user — every tool runs through the same gated endpoint AS the caller, so
//     the agent has the user's EXACT rights and the real door re-checks each call.
//   • Confirm rule — the agent pauses for a yes/no panel ONLY before a DESTRUCTIVE act
//     (removing a member, revoking an invite, or DEACTIVATING an existing role /
//     article / dropdown value) or a BULK / import write. Every constructive write runs
//     straight away (see `requiresConfirm` — the one place this is decided).
//   • Catastrophic blocks — controlling DEVICE SESSIONS and DELETING the team are not in
//     the catalog; the agent structurally cannot do them (identityBlocked is the backstop).
//   • Fence — tool RESULTS are returned to the model as DATA (role:"tool"), never as
//     instructions; the system prompt reinforces it.

/** LIST TOOLS THE GRAMMAR REPLACED — dropped from THIS surface only.
 *
 * `query_records` asks any module a question, so a tool whose whole job was
 * "give me this collection, narrowed by these three words" is now a second way
 * to say something the grammar says better — and on this surface a second way
 * is not free: every definition is re-sent on every model step of every turn.
 * The MCP surface keeps all of them, unchanged, for the reason it kept the
 * twenty-one toggles: it fetches its catalogue once, and a tool name there is an
 * external contract.
 *
 * THE BAR FOR A LINE HERE is that the grammar is a STRICT SUPERSET of the door's
 * own narrowing — every parameter it parses maps to a declared field, and it
 * offers no derived view (`scope=mine`, `view=overdue`, `when=current`) that a
 * filter cannot express. Six list tools deliberately stay: `list_help_tickets`
 * (`scope=mine` is a join through who is staffed to an app), `list_work_logs`
 * (the same, and the model has no way to name "me"), `list_stories`,
 * `list_todos` and `list_sprints` (each carries a derived view or a month), and
 * `list_knowledge_sources`, which returns a SOURCE'S OWN WORDS when given an id
 * and is the one read the prompt sends the model to for reading a document
 * whole.
 *
 * `list_meetings` USED TO BE AN EIGHTH — its `view`, `month` and `transcript`
 * are exactly this same "derived view or a month" shape, and stayed for it. What
 * was NOT a derived view was `q`: the door's own multi-field search reaches the
 * guest list (workers/content/src/lib/meetings.ts's `whereFor` — 251 of 458 live
 * meetings carry one against 4 with an agenda), and the grammar had no field for
 * it, so folding this tool in would have silently narrowed what a caller could
 * search. Fixed by declaring `guests` beside `title`/`agenda`/`notes` in
 * `QUERY_MODULES.meetings` — now a strict superset, and this is the ninth line.
 *
 * Rot-checked by `workers/data-ops/test/tool-diet.test.ts`: every name here must
 * still be a shared GET tool, and its module must still be one the grammar can
 * be asked about — so a line cannot outlive the capability that replaced it. */

 *
 * ── WHY THIS TAKES AN ARGUMENT NOW ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The catalogue is a BILL, not a menu. 191 tool definitions are ~109 KB of the
 * ~130 KB preamble that is re-sent on every model turn, and at the owner's
 * stated volume each tool costs about $5 a month before it is ever called
 * (test/prompt-cache.test.ts derives it). Sending a Viewer the definition of
 * `remove_member` is money spent describing a door that will refuse them.
 *
 * So `held` — the caller's own rights, as `module:right` — drops the tools their
 * role could never call. It changes no permission: every tool still runs through
 * the real gated door as the user, and the door is still the authority. It only
 * stops paying to describe the ones that are certain to be refused.
 *
 * FAIL OPEN, DELIBERATELY, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS:
 *   • no `held` at all (the sheet could not be read) → the whole catalogue, which
 *     is exactly the behaviour before this existed. A permissions read that fails
 *     must never quietly shrink what the assistant can do.
 *   • a tool with no declared gate in TOOL_GATES → kept. An undeclared gate means
 *     "nobody has classified this", not "nobody may call it", and guessing the
 *     second from the first would silently retire a working tool.
 *
 * The cost of that choice is honest, and it is NOT written down here as a number.
 * This sentence used to read "33 of the 166 shared tools carry no gate"; the real
 * figures were 52 of 165, and nothing had said so for weeks — a count in a
 * comment is a measurement with no way to fail. Two places carry it instead, and
 * both break when it moves: `UNGATED_CEILING` in test/tool-diet.test.ts (a
 * ceiling, so the number can only fall) and `node scripts/measure-preamble.mjs`,
 * which prints today's count and the trim FLOOR beside it — what a caller
 * holding no rights still receives, which is what the ungated tools cost.
 * R36's `offered-rights` is what keeps the number falling, because it fails when
 * a right is asked for and never offered. */

// WHAT WAS WRONG. Every model call re-sent all 165 tool definitions: 132,828
// characters, ~34,751 tokens, on every step of every turn, up to twelve steps.
// Measured 2026-09-06 by `node scripts/measure-preamble.mjs`. A one-word question
// paid for the whole menu before anybody read the first line of it, and at the
// owner's stated volume that is the largest single line in the product's bill.
//
// WHERE THE BYTES ACTUALLY WERE, which is what decided the design: of the 107,364
// characters of tool JSON, the DESCRIPTIONS are 71,787 (66.9%) and the schemas
// 26,677 (24.8%). So the obvious build — "send names and schemas, defer the
// prose" — would have saved a quarter. The prose IS the catalogue.
//
// SO THE INDEX IS NAMES. Stage one sends the CORE tools in full plus a flat,
// sorted list of every other tool's NAME (3,023 characters for 159 of them);
// stage two is `load_tools`, which hands back the full definitions of the ones
// the model asks for, and the loop re-sends those on every step after it.
//
// Names, rather than a module grouping, for one reason that matters: a module is
// not a fact this file has. `TOOL_GATES` maps WRITES only — a read carries no
// line there by design, which is why 52 tools look "ungated" — so grouping by
// module would have needed a new field on 165 entries or a second map to keep
// true. The names are already there, already unique, and already descriptive:
// `list_role_rates` and `set_client_tool_price` say what they are.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS. One extra step on a turn that needs a specialist tool, and a
// prefix cache that re-warms after a load (the tools array changes, so steps
// after a load share a different prefix from steps before it). Both are small
// against 70% off every step of every turn.
//
// WHAT IS NOT MEASURED, and it is the honest gap: whether the model ROUTES as
// well from an index of names as it does from 165 full definitions. That is
// `scripts/agent-routing-bench.mjs`, it makes real model calls, and it costs
// money — so it is the gate before this is deployed, not before it is committed.
// The bench's own history says why the question is live: the same question was
// answered correctly with 10 and 25 tools offered, not at all with 50, and
// wrongly with 100 (model.ts records it). Fewer tools has never been the thing
// that hurt; it is the direction the evidence points.

 * module a question (it is the grammar that already replaced a drawer of list
 * tools — see REPLACED_BY_QUERY), `ask_knowledge` reaches the corpus,
 * `read_activity` is the cross-module history, `set_record_active` is already one
 * tool over twenty-one doors, and `run_import_batch` is the one action an
 * attached-file plan names by hand — a turn that has just been handed a plan
 * must not need a round trip to be able to act on it.
 *
 * `load_tools` is not listed: it is defined below and always sent, because a
 * catalogue you cannot open is a shorter catalogue and nothing else. */

 * and the resolve door.
