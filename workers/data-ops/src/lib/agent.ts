 * BUBBLE — no answer, no error, no sign anything had happened. That is the worst

 *
 * A ceiling the app owns turns that into a sentence. It is generous on purpose —
 * a genuine four-step job with a document read in it is allowed to take a minute
 * and a half — and it is checked BETWEEN steps rather than interrupting one, so
 * the turn always ends on a whole tool call with its result recorded. */

/** WHICH DOOR A QUESTION OPENS — the routing rule, and why it points where it does.
 *
 * The prompt used to answer this question twice, differently. One sentence said
 * "to answer ANY question about THIS team's real data — its members, roles,
 * accounts, or support tickets — you MUST first call the matching tool (for
 * example list_roles, list_members, list_accounts, list_help_tickets)"; another,
 * further down, said a question about what the team KNOWS goes to ask_knowledge.
 * Both are reasonable sentences. They collide on the most ordinary question
 * anybody asks here — "what's going on with the HOGO account?" — and the first
 * one wins, because it is marked IMPORTANT and it names the very word the
 * question used.
 *
 * MEASURED, before and after, by scripts/agent-routing-bench.mjs: 18 real
 * questions, the shipped prompt, the shipped catalogue, claude-sonnet-5 at low
 * effort, one turn each, reading which door the model opens FIRST.
 *
 *                                          before   after
 *   a knowledge question → ask_knowledge     6/12    12/12
 *   a counting question → a live read         6/6     6/6
 *
 * Every one of the six misses was the same shape: a question ABOUT a record went
 * to the list that names it — "tell me about FluClinic" to list_accounts, "where
 * do things stand with task 3144" to list_help_tickets — which answers with a row
 * of metadata and not one word of what the record has been through.
 *
 * Four CONTROL questions were added AFTER that pair, and they exist to catch the
 * opposite failure — a rule that sends everything to the base would score full
 * marks above by over-steering. Three writes and "is the knowledge base up to
 * date?"; all four route live. 22/22 on the run that includes them.
 *
 * Read the number for what it is: 18 questions, authored here, graded against
 * expectations authored here. It is evidence the rule steers, not proof the
 * model is right about every question anybody will ask. The half worth trusting
 * most is the live one, because that is the direction where a mis-steer invents
 * a number, and it did not move.
 *
 * WHY THE KNOWLEDGE BASE IS THE DEFAULT. This is a fact about this app, not a
 * preference: the base MIRRORS the team's own rows — ten kinds of them, tickets
 * through tasks (workers/content/src/lib/knowledge-ingest.ts) — it is swept every
 * fifteen minutes, and every citation it hands back carries `liveStatus`, that
 * record read out of the database at the moment of asking. So one call returns
 * the material AND what is true right now, where a list read returns a row and no
 * material at all.
 *
 * WHY HALF THE QUESTIONS STILL GO LIVE, and this half is not a preference either:
 * retrieval reads a SAMPLE. It cannot count, enumerate, sort or filter. "How many
 * open tickets" answered out of passages is a confident wrong number, and a
 * confident wrong number is worse than a slow right one — so those questions get
 * a real read every time, and the rule says which is which in the model's own
 * vocabulary rather than leaving it to be inferred.
 *
 * Named rather than inlined for the reason DROPDOWN_ORDER_RULE is: it is the
 * sentence a test can hold, and agent-parity.test.ts checks both that it rides
 * the wall and that every tool it names is a tool that exists. */

  "Never answer a question about THIS team out of your own memory — look it up. There are two ways to look something up and choosing well is most of doing this job properly.",
  "ask_knowledge is your DEFAULT, and you should reach for it first. It searches everything the team knows at once: its documents, notes and meeting transcripts, AND a mirror of the app's own records — tickets, accounts, contacts, systems, process maps, sprints, stories, meetings, to-dos and tasks — kept in step every fifteen minutes. Each source it cites also carries `liveStatus`, that record read from the database as you ask. So for any question ABOUT something — what it says, what was agreed on it, what has happened to it, where it stands, \"tell me about X\", \"catch me up on Y\", \"what's the latest on Z\" — one ask_knowledge call gives you both the story and what is true today, and it is far quicker than hunting through lists.",
  "Go to a live read instead when the question needs the one thing retrieval cannot give you: a COUNT, a whole LIST, a SORT, a FILTER. \"How many\", \"which ones\", \"all of them\", \"newest first\", \"in July\", \"per client\". Retrieval reads a sample, so a number that comes out of it is a guess; those questions get a real read every time. Go live too when you are about to change something, and whenever an answer needs to be exhaustive rather than well-sourced.",
  "query_records is the live read, and it is ONE tool for every module: tickets, stories, sprints, work_logs, tasks, todos, meetings, accounts, apps, app_modules, processes, deliverables, waves, knowledge_sources, roles, dropdown_values and account_rates. Call describe_module first on any module you have not queried in this conversation and use the field names it gives you — a guessed field name is refused, not ignored. It also lists the client names in use, so check the spelling there before filtering by one. The modules answer to the other names this app uses for the same thing, so \"help\" reaches tickets; and if a call is ever refused for a name, the refusal says what to use instead — read it and try again in the same turn rather than offering to do the work. Then say what you want in filters rather than reading rows and counting them yourself: a date range is one filter with the \"between\" operator, three clients named in one question is one filter with \"contains\" and a list of their names, and \"how many per client\" or \"per month\" is groupBy, which comes back as counts. Two calls should answer almost anything. When the question is about the MOST RECENT or the LATEST or the OLDEST of something, say which date you mean and pass `sort` — a read with no order given comes back in the module's own default, which for tickets is newest-by-CREATION and is a different record from newest-by-UPDATE; the answer tells you which order it used, so check it before you name a record. And when an answer comes back with `unmatched`, name those values in your reply beside the number — if somebody asks about three clients and one of them does not exist here, the honest sentence is the count AND which of the three it does not cover; repeating their three names next to a total for two is a correct number wrapped in a false statement. The same applies to a record you cannot find: if you looked one up by its reference and `unmatched` names it, say the reference matched nothing — and try the other handle before you say it does not exist, because a record has an `id` and a `ref` and they are not interchangeable. Paging through hundreds of rows to count them by hand is the wrong answer to a question the door can answer in one.",

Find it once, then read it WHOLE by id: `list_knowledge_sources` with `id` returns that source's own words, and `get_meeting_transcript` returns everything said in a meeting. Two reads give you both sides of a comparison, in full, and a whole transcript is a normal thing to be handed. Listing the same collection again with different wording returns material you have already seen, and you have a limited number of steps to spend — so spend them on reading the thing, not on finding it twice.",

 * `JSON.stringify(data).slice(0, 2000)`. A list door answers through `pagedJson`,
 * whose shape is `{rows: […50…], total, hasMore, nextCursor}` — the ROWS FIRST.
 * A ticket carries about thirty fields including a free-text description, so two
 * thousand characters is three or four rows and then the cut lands mid-object,
 * taking `total`, `hasMore` and `nextCursor` with it. `total` is the exact count;
 * `nextCursor` is the only way to read further; `list_help_tickets`' own
 * description PROMISES both. So asked "how many open tickets does Confia have?"
 * the model received a truncated array, no count, no way to page, and no word
 * saying anything had been removed — and did the only thing left open to it,
 * which was to call the same tool with the same arguments again. Four times, at
 * one AI unit of the team's allowance per attempt.
 *
 * So the trim is shape-aware and it is LOUD. Every field that is not the row list
 * survives whatever else has to go — they are the summary, and they are tiny —
 * the rows are dropped from the END in whole rows, and a plain sentence says how
 * many of how many are here. It stays valid JSON, so the model can still parse
 * it. Anything already under the ceiling is handed over untouched.
 *
 * AND A READ OF ONE THING IS NOT A PAGE OF FIFTY. See RECORD_CHARS: a result
 * carrying few rows is a record being read, its text is the whole point of the
 * call, and it gets the room to arrive. A row that is too big even for that keeps
 * its place and loses the tail of its longest field, because one document with a
 * cut in it is worth more than no document and a sentence about paging.
 *
 * The note is stated as a FACT, not as an instruction: everything inside a tool
 * result is data the model must never take orders from (TOOL_RESULT_TAG, and the
 * system prompt that names it), and that has to hold for the sentences we write
 * ourselves too. */

 * call would have returned, it is the same answer. A WRITE is not — two identical
 * writes in one turn are almost always a mistake, but swallowing the second one
 * would be this seam quietly deciding a thing the door and the confirm panel are

 * owner asked about one meeting and the model called `list_meetings` twelve times
 * — a different page or filter each time, so every call was a fresh key — until
 * MAX_STEPS ran out and the turn ended with "I took several steps and paused
 * here." Twelve assistant credits, no answer, and his own screenshot of a column
 * of identical-looking step rows.
 *
 * He asked the right question about it: why page the whole collection instead of
 * asking the knowledge base and then confirming with ONE narrowed read. The
 * prompt already says exactly that. The model did it anyway, which is what makes
 * a guard the right layer rather than more words in the preamble.
 *
 * READS ONLY, and the safety argument is `repeatGuard`'s: a read is idempotent
 * and it has already been answered several times this turn, so declining the next
 * one loses nothing that was not already handed over. A WRITE always runs — a
 * seam that silently swallowed a second write would be deciding something the
 * door and the confirm panel exist to decide.

 * this reads that row back and says what it says: total rows first (so a clipped
 * line can never hide the blast radius), then each file and the table it lands
 * in. The model's sentence never reaches the panel. Nothing else about the call
 * changes: the stored proposal /confirm runs is `tc.input` as the model wrote it,

  // gives back money that has gone. Worse, it fired on the failed-STEP exit — a
  // failure any caller can produce on demand (ask to invite someone who is
  // already a member) — so the credit lane became the unbounded one the free
  // allowance was so carefully kept from becoming. The comment below explains at
  // length why the free allowance must never come back, then handed the credit
  // back on exactly the turn it was describing.
  //
  // A unit is SPENT the moment the model answers. Whether the answer pleased
  // anybody, whether the door then refused the write, whether the wrap-up had to
  // explain a failure — none of that un-burns the tokens. So exactly one unit is
  // ever refundable: the one metered for the step whose model call THREW, which
  // bought no completion at all. Not an earlier step's; not a step whose tools
  // were refused; not the prepaid confirm unit, which already bought its writes.
  //
  // THE FREE ALLOWANCE IS STILL NEVER REFUNDED. It is not a price, it is the
  // daily BOUND on how much model spend this team can cause, and a refund
  // dissolves the bound. Credits come back on this one path because a model
  // outage is ours, not the customer's.
