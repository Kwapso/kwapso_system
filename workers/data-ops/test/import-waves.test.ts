// THE IMPORT WRITES ITS ROWS IN WAVES, AND STILL COUNTS THEM IN ORDER.
//
// `BULK_CONCURRENCY` was written on 25 Aug 2026 with three paragraphs explaining
// exactly the failure the CSV import had — a serial `for` loop over rows, each
// row a door hop, each hop several database trips at ~150ms — and for eleven
// days it had ONE call site, the bulk ticket action, while the biggest bulk path
// in the product was still the loop the constant existed to replace.
//
// Measured 5 Sep 2026 (scripts/speed-bench.mjs, staging): 1,799ms per row one at
// a time, 190ms per row twelve at a time. A 1,000-row file went from 30 minutes
// to 3.2 minutes.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS PINS, and the second is the one a rewrite would lose.
//
// 1. The wave itself. Read off the source, the same way `bulk-waves.test.ts`
//    pins its sibling and for the same stated reason: `node:sqlite` is
//    synchronous, so peak concurrency cannot be observed from inside the
//    harness. What CAN be read is that the loop steps by a wave and that
//    nothing awaits one row at a time again.
//
// 2. The exception, which is not tidiness. Two import targets declare a
//    reference with `onMissing: "create"`, which lands on `ensureSelectableValue`
//    — a SELECT followed by an INSERT with no unique constraint underneath it.
//    Serially that is safe. Twelve rows naming the same NEW dropdown value at
//    once would each miss the SELECT and insert their own copy, and the person
//    would find their vocabulary list holding the same word twelve times with
//    nothing in the import report to explain it. Those targets keep the serial
//    loop, DERIVED from the target's own references so a target that gains such
//    a reference tomorrow is covered without anybody remembering this comment.
