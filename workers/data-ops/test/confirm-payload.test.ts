// The yes/no panel is the designated defence against the assistant being talked
// into something — the model reads team data an attacker can author, so the last
// line is a human clicking "Go ahead". It used to show the tool's one-line
// summary and nothing else: "Set access rights for the Sub Admin role" hid WHICH
// rights, and a privilege grant nobody could read is a privilege grant nobody
// reviewed.
//
// This suite locks the payload OPEN, and it is DERIVED (never a list of tools):
// every confirming tool in the catalog is fed a sample built from its own schema,
// and every field of the body it would POST must be visible in the panel's lines.
// A tool added tomorrow is covered the moment it exists. The earlier version of
// this defence was a green test that asserted the WRONG intent (that a confirm
// happened, not that it was readable) — so these assertions read the rendered
// lines, not the fact that a function was called.
