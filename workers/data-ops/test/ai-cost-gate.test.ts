// A DOOR THAT SPENDS THE TEAM'S MONEY IS AN ASSISTANT DOOR.
//
// `POST /api/data-ops/import/batch/plan` runs a model turn and calls
// `consumeAiUnit`, which spends the free daily allowance and then decrements
// `agent_credits.balance` — credits the owner PAID for. It opened with
// `requireAnyImportRight` and nothing else, so the `agent` module gated the
// assistant everywhere except the one import step that is an assistant.
//
// That is not a theoretical gap: MCP.md §1 recommends, by name, issuing a token
// with import rights and NO agent access as "the safe, zero-AI-cost choice". A
// token created on that advice could loop this door and take the balance to zero
// — and could not even read `get_ai_allowance` to see it happening, because that
// read needs `agent:read`.
//
// Read off the door's own source rather than mocked: what is under test is which
// gates the handler OPENS WITH, and in what order relative to the spend.
//
// IT READS TWO WORKERS NOW, and the second one is why the scan had to widen. The
// knowledge base WRITES its answer (R23) on a cheap model, in the CONTENT worker,
// and that spends the same allowance out of the same two tables — so a law that
// only ever looked at data-ops would have graded the one worker it already knew
// about. The denominator is "every route file that calls consumeAiUnit", derived
// from the routes themselves, so the next worker that starts spending is judged
// the day it does.
