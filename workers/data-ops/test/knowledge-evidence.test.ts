// WHAT THE PANEL IS TOLD ABOUT A RETRIEVAL (Law R23, the wire half).
//
// The client is sent step rows and never a tool's result, so for as long as this
// app has had an assistant, a knowledge answer's citations reached the MODEL and
// stopped there — the panel could not have drawn a source under an answer if it
// had wanted to. `knowledgeEvidence` is the one frame that changes that, and
// these lock the two ways it can go wrong, both of them silent:
//
//   · it fires for a door it should not, and a turn draws "sources" that are
//     rows out of some other tool;
//   · it does NOT fire when it should, and every answer is prose again — which
//     looks exactly like an assistant that simply did not cite anything.
//
// And the third link, which is the one nobody would think to test: a conversation
// REOPENED tomorrow. The evidence is not stored in a column of its own; it is
// recovered out of the tool row's own saved text, so the writer and the reader
// have to agree on that text forever.
