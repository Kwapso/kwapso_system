// The error-RECORDING seam, machine-checked like the publish seam: every worker
// that binds the core DB must record unexpected crashes into the central
// error_logs table from a central catch (ERROR-HANDLING.md). A worker whose
// catch stops calling recordWorkerError silently loses its error history.
//
// THE ROSTER COMES FROM DISK, not from a list typed here. The list version named
// four workers and the fleet grew to eight: mcp complied by hand but unguarded
// (deleting its call kept the build green), realtime recorded nothing at all,
// and the two gateways could crash a stranger's request into a bare 1101 with
// nobody the wiser. A check that has to be edited whenever a worker is added is
// a check that will one day be forgotten — which is exactly what happened.
//
// Two obligations, decided by what a worker actually binds:
//   • binds the core DB  → it CAN record, so it MUST.
//   • binds no database  → it cannot record, so it must at least ANSWER: a
//     central catch that returns a clean response instead of a raw crash.
