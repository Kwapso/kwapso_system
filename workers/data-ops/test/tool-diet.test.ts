 * prove the module NAME is real and the tool is gone; neither ever asked
 * whether the grammar can actually SAY what the door's own `q` search says.
 *
 * `q` is the case that matters, because it is the one filter these doors
 * spread across SEVERAL columns rather than one. Deleting the `guests` field
 * this fold was built to add left every other check in this file green — the
 * name is still real, the module is still named, the tool is still gone — so
 * the gap it closes was provable only by reading the door's OWN source for
 * which columns its `q` really touches. That is what this does, the same way
 * R19 derives a tool's obligations: off disk, never hand-listed.
 *
 * TWO HOPS, not one. A door's handler does not build its own WHERE clause —
 * `getMeetings` calls `listMeetings`, and `listMeetings` calls `whereFor`,
 * which is where the LIKE clause actually lives (`getAccounts` →
 * `listAccounts` → `accountsWhere`, `getApps` → `listApps` → `appsWhere`, the
