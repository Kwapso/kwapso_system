// AN HONEST FAILURE BEATS A QUIET DEMOTION.
//
// The original sin: `selectModel` ended `return new WorkersAiModel(…)` whenever
// ANTHROPIC_API_KEY was unset. A secret that never got set on a new environment,
// or a rotation that half happened, therefore produced an assistant that kept
// answering — from a much weaker engine, with nobody told. Somebody judging the
// assistant in that state is judging a product they were never shown.
//
// The owner's ruling on 2026-08-27 was two words: "kill the escape hatch."
//
// THE WORLD INVERTED ON 2026-08-28 AND THE PRINCIPLE DID NOT. The owner moved the
// assistant onto Cloudflare (@cf/zai-org/glm-5.3-flash) and disabled the
// Anthropic key, so Workers AI is no longer the weak fallback — it is the engine.
// There is nothing left to fall back TO, which is a stronger position than the
// one this file used to defend, and exactly the reason the lock has to be
// rewritten rather than deleted: a suite that still asserted a throw on a missing
// ANTHROPIC_API_KEY would be green, meaningless, and read as coverage.
//
// So the property is now the one that survives the swap: ONE engine, chosen in
// ONE place, with no second branch that could quietly substitute another — and a
// door failure that still classifies into a sentence a person can act on.
