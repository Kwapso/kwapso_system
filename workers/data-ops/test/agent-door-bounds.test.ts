// TWO THINGS THE AGENT'S DOORS OWE A STRANGER: a ceiling in front of the parse,
// and one sentence for "not yours" and "not there".
//
// THE CEILING. `POST /agent/chat` has real caps — eight files, ~5 MB each — and
// every one of them was read AFTER `request.json()` had already buffered and
// parsed the whole body. So the caps bounded what could be IMPORTED while the
// parse bounded what could be SENT, and the parse's own bound was 40 MB of JSON
// string in a 128 MB isolate. A ceiling is only a ceiling if it is checked before
// the expensive step, so the ORDER is the assertion, not the number.
//
// THE SENTENCE. `listMessages` read the thread row and then judged it: a
// colleague's thread id answered 403 and a made-up one 404. Forty lines below it,
// its write-side sibling `requireOwnThread` resolves ownership INSIDE the WHERE
// and says why in one line — "404, not 403: 'that thread isn't yours' confirms
// the thread exists". Two answers on one table is an existence oracle over every
// private conversation in the team, from the door that exists to keep them private.
