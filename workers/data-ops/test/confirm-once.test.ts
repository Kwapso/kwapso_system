// THE APPROVAL GATE HAS ONE JOB: a dangerous call runs when — and only when —
// the person approved it. It ran TWICE on a double-tap, and it ran AFTER A "NO".
//
// confirmAndRun read the stored proposal, executed every call in it, and only
// then marked it "done" with an UPDATE that checked nothing. So two /confirm
// posts (a double-click, a retried request, a reconnecting stream) both read the
// same "proposed" calls and both executed them — a second invite, a second row,
// a second of whatever the model had asked permission for.
//
// The shape is CONCURRENCY.md's "a retryable operation that must run at most once
// claims it first" — the CSV importer's planned→running flip is its twin, locked
// the same way next door in import-idempotency.test.ts.
//
// AND THE OTHER ANSWER. This suite locked the approve path thoroughly and never
// touched decline — so it stayed green over a gate that only half worked. The
// decline branch appended "Okay — I've left that alone." and RETURNED, without
// spending the proposal, and it does not shadow it either: appendMessage writes
// tool_calls_json = NULL while getPendingProposal reads the newest assistant row
// that HAS a proposal. The refused calls therefore stayed "proposed" for ever and
// a later {approve:true} on the same thread executed exactly what the person had
// turned down. Sharpest on MCP, where agent_confirm is a tool an autonomous
// client calls: the operator declines, the client retries, the write lands.
//
// The decline half below is BEHAVIOURAL, against the real schema, because that is
// the only way to prove the thing that actually matters — that the refused call
// never reaches its door.
