// R10 — the gating seam for DATA-OPS. The scan itself is shared
// (shared/rules/seam-scan.ts); what lives here is the only thing that is
// genuinely this worker's — the reviewed exceptions.
//
// Data-ops has NONE on the write side: the import steps gate on an import right
// (confirm gates `create` on every destination module), the assistant gates on
// `agent:create`, and the owner endpoints (grant-credits, seed-targets,
// errors/resolve) gate on adminGuard. That empty object is a statement, not an
// oversight.
//
// AND ITS READS ARE SCANNED TOO, which R10 alone does not cover. `teamContext`
// proves signed-in + an active membership; it evaluates no right. That is the
// whole answer for a door serving the app's own SHAPE (the import catalogue, a
// blank sample file) and for one that reads only the caller's OWN rows. It was
// NOT the answer for `GET /import/batches`, which hands back the team's import
// history — uploaded file names, target tables, row counts — to anyone signed
// in, including a client login on the agency origin. So every read door either
// asks a permission question or is named below with the reason it needn't.
