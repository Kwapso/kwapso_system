//    GRANTS (who-can-do-what never changes silently),
//    deactivations (a role/article/dropdown value, only when switching OFF), and
//    deactivations and bulk/import writes pause for the yes/no panel; every OTHER
//    constructive write (article, ticket, reply, team details, reactivate) runs free,
//  • the catalog is OPT-IN (only listed actions are tools), and
//  • the agent acts AS the user with the user's EXACT rights (the server re-checks each
//    call); it still cannot control device sessions or delete the team. Managing
//    existing members (set a role, remove someone) IS allowed — normal, re-gated CRUD.
