// WHY THE ASSISTANT CALLED THE SAME TOOL FOUR TIMES — and the two things that
// stop it, tested as the pure logic they are (no model, no DB, no network).
//
// Asked "How many open tickets does Confia have?" on staging, the assistant called
// list_support_tickets four times in a row with the same arguments. That reads like
// a model fault and it is not one. A list door answers through `pagedJson`, whose
// shape is `{tickets: […50…], total, hasMore, nextCursor}` — the ROWS FIRST — and
// the loop handed the model `JSON.stringify(data).slice(0, 2000)`. A ticket is
// about thirty fields including a free-text description, so two thousand characters
// is three or four rows, and then the cut lands mid-object and takes `total`,
// `hasMore` and `nextCursor` with it.
//
// `total` is the exact count the question asked for. `nextCursor` is the only way
// to read further. list_help_tickets' own description PROMISES both. The model got
// neither, and no word saying they had been removed — so it did the one thing still
// open to it, which was to ask again. At one AI unit of the team's daily allowance
// per attempt, that is a money bug as well as an honesty one.
//
// So there are two guards, and only the first is the fix:
//   • trimResult drops ROWS, never the tail, and says what it dropped;
//   • repeatGuard makes an identical READ in one turn answer from the first call.
