// TRANSLATING WHAT A PERSON TYPED — the door's defence against an answer that
// came back wrong, and the shape of the door itself.
//
// THE LINE THIS DOOR SITS ON. shared/i18n.ts says the app translates what WE
// wrote and never what a PERSON typed. This door is the one place a READER may
// cross that line, for themselves, by pressing a button — so the two things
// worth locking are that it never crosses it on anybody's behalf (it writes
// nothing, it is refused to a client login, and it costs one unit per press),
// and that a model's bad answer degrades to the words that were typed rather
// than to a hole on the screen.
//
// THE PARSE IS RUN, NOT READ. Every branch below is a real answer a model has
// given at some point — a fenced block, a short array, a null in the middle, a
// paragraph of apology instead of JSON. A test that read the source for the word
// "JSON.parse" would pass for all of them.
