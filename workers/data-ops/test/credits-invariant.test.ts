  // This used to read `.toBe("true")`: staging was the environment that asked to
  // be uncapped, so that testing could never be refused for running out. It was
  // the right trade while staging was one person trying a screen.
  //
  // It stopped being one person. Eight review lanes and every `*-bench.mjs` run
  // against staging now, and `AGENT_NO_DAILY_CAP` does not raise the ceiling —
  // it REMOVES it (`capFor` returns MAX_SAFE_INTEGER). So a loop that retried
  // the agent door could spend the account to zero and the first signal would be
  // the Cloudflare bill. The meter kept measuring and nothing could ever say no.
  //
  // The owner's answer (relayed 2026-09-06) was not "put the cap back" — a cap
  // of 50 would refuse a normal day's testing by mid-morning, which is how the
  // flag came to exist. It was: a HIGH ceiling that only stops a runaway. So the
  // flag is gone from all three staging blocks and the number is 2,000 a team a
  // day, which is a real ceiling denominated in real money:
  //
  //     2,000 units × $0.0345 a step (COSTS.md, kimi-k2.6 at the measured
  //     preamble) = about $69 a team a day, worst case, if every unit were spent
  //
  // — roughly forty times a heavy testing day and nowhere near an unattended
  // loop, which is exactly the shape "only stops a runaway" describes. It is per
  // TEAM, so the estate ceiling is that times the teams on staging.
  //
