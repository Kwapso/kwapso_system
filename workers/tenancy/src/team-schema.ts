/** THE SPRINT-TYPE CATALOGUE — the ten ways the agency runs an engagement.
 *
 * These rows used to be the `programs` table behind the Delivery method page.
 * The page went on 17 Aug 2026 and the DATA did not: a programme was never
 * anything but "the kind of block this sprint is", which is the question the
 * sprint type already answers, so the two were one idea wearing two names. What
 * the programme carried and the sprint type did not is here — the mark somebody
 * recognises it by, the German name the agency already uses with its German
 * clients, the sentence that explains what the block includes, and how long one
 * normally runs. That is what lets a sprint say "Implementation, 21 days".
 *
 * A STARTING vocabulary, like the ticket types: every field is editable on the
 * team's own Dropdown values screen, and a team that has retired one keeps it
 * retired (the seed and migration 0025 are both pick-or-create).
 *
 * `standardDays` is a suggestion, never a rule — a sprint's real dates are the
 * ones somebody agreed with the client. `nameDe` is the ONE curated label
 * carried across from the legacy catalogue, because these words were already in
 * front of German clients; every other language comes from the translation
 * layer, which is why there is no third column here and never will be.
 * `Assessment` arrives bare — the legacy row had no mark, no German name and no
 * length, and inventing three would be worse than carrying a thin row honestly.
 *
 * THE MARK IS A TWO-LETTER CODE, not a pictograph — the client's ruling,
 * 2026-08-31: "i said no emojis. why are there still emojis? kill them!" The
 * legacy catalogue carried an emoji per type; this is the same ten types, the
 * same one-glyph-per-type shape, with the glyph made of letters instead, the
 * same substitution `shared/app-stages.ts` made for the app stages. */

-- five ways by five people, and the whole point of the dropdown module is that
-- the fifth person picks what the first one wrote.
--
-- So the two groups are created here, seeded with the bands (five, as the legacy
-- data has) and with the countries the customer records themselves evidence: the
-- language field is German, Spanish, Catalan or English, and the addresses are
-- European. The legacy labels arrive with the migration and pick-or-create into

-- exists is a group the import lands IN, instead of sixteen more homeless rows.

-- MEETINGS — the section the owner asked for, and the one noun the legacy import
-- had nowhere to put.
--
-- Glide held 350 of them and the reconciliation folded every one into a WORK LOG,
-- because a work log was the only row that carried a date, a duration and a
-- client. That kept the hours and threw away the meeting: what was on the agenda,
-- what was decided, and who it was with. A work log answers "how long did that
-- take"; it has no field that can answer "what did we agree in March".
--
-- So this is a record of its own, and the two things on it that nothing else in
-- the app holds are \`agenda\` and \`notes\`. Time still goes on a work log — a
-- meeting is not a timesheet — and the two are joined by nothing on purpose: a
-- meeting that ran long is two facts, not one.
--
-- WHY IT IS ITS OWN MODULE and not four more rights on \`delivery\`:
-- \`meeting_purposes\` is a TAXONOMY of why we meet (a settled list somebody
-- curates once a year). A meeting is a record that accumulates forever. Sharing
-- one permission row would mean granting the right to read every note ever taken
-- in order to let somebody see the list of purposes.
--
-- \`purpose_id\` points at that taxonomy, so "why did we meet" is a dropdown value
-- rather than a fifth spelling typed into a title.
--
-- \`status\` is two words, not five: a meeting is scheduled, or it has been held.
-- Cancelling is \`deactivated_at\` like every other retirement in the base — the
-- row survives, so a client asking "didn't we have a call in March?" is answerable
-- either way.
--   SUPERSEDED 18 Aug 2026 (see 0037): the held status is retired and nothing
--   reads \`status\` or \`held_at\` any more — a meeting's own \`starts_at\` says
--   whether it has happened. The columns stay, because what people ticked while
--   the idea existed is still history. The sentence about cancelling still holds.
--
-- \`google_event_id\` is what makes the calendar push idempotent. Pressing "put it
-- in my calendar" twice must not make two entries, and the row is the only place
-- that memory can live (SCOPE ch.03: Google being an hour behind breaks nothing —
-- Google holding two copies of one meeting is not the same kind of harmless).
--   SUPERSEDED 18 Aug 2026: there is no calendar push, the calendar is one-way.
--   The column and its unique index do the same work from the other direction —
--   they are how the sweep recognises an entry it has already made a record of.

    //                           the 221 seeded requests were typed by staff on a
    //                           client's behalf. It points at an `accounts` row of

    //                           account row (there is no contacts table, and 15.1
    //                           says why);
    //   `validated_at`          when the client's main stakeholder said yes (5.13).
    //                           Only the kinds that WAIT ever carry one.
    //
    // ON THE STORY:
    //   `story_type`            Fix / Feature / Change, editable like every other
    //                           vocabulary here (6.2). Nullable, because 3,677
    //                           stories arrived from the previous system with no
    //                           type and a NOT NULL would have made the import the
    //                           first thing this migration broke;
    //   `review_note` + the two file columns  what was done, and optionally
    //                           something to show for it (6.9 — Aurora's ruling
    //                           that the file is required only when there IS one).
    //
    // AND TWO TABLES, because both are genuinely many:
    //   `help_attachments`      several files AND several links on one ticket, from
    //                           both front doors (5.10). One shape for both kinds:
    //                           "here is the thing I mean" is one act, and a
    //                           second table would have meant two lists, two
    //                           counts and two ways to be wrong about the order;
    //   `story_processes`       a story links to one or MORE processes (6.5). The
    //                           `process_id` column on `stories` stays and is the
    //                           first of these — the savings maths and the import
    //                           both address a story's map by one id, and dropping
    //                           a column is the one migration you cannot take back.
    //
    // THE TWO NEW STATUSES ARE NOT SCHEMA. `status` is a free TEXT column the code
    // validates against `HELP_STATUSES`, so `awaiting_validation` and `scheduled`
    // need no DDL — and no back-fill either, deliberately: an existing ticket sits
    // in a state somebody genuinely put it in, and quietly re-deciding history is
    // how a report stops being believable. New tickets get the new ladder.
    //
    // TWO TICKET TYPES ARE ADDED, never swapped. The sub-tabs (5.1) are DERIVED
    // from the team's own live `Ticket type` values, so this migration only has to
    // make sure the two words the feedback names — Issue and Request — exist.
    // Retiring Feedback and Bug is CHECKLIST 2.1 and belongs to the words lane;
    // adding here and retiring there compose, whichever order they land in.

    // called it, where to join, what was attached) was reachable only by asking
    // Google again, live, with the reader's own token.
    //
    // That is not a small inconvenience. It means the facts are unavailable to
    // ANYBODY BUT THE PERSON WHOSE CONNECTION PUSHED THE MEETING, unreadable when
    // Google is slow, and impossible to put in a list — fifty rows would be fifty
    // calls. A meeting record that cannot say who was in the room is a record of
    // a conversation with the conversation left out.

    // THEY ARE A MIRROR AND THEY SAY SO. Every one is prefixed \`google_\`, and
    // \`google_synced_at\` says when it was last true. Nothing in the app WRITES
    // to Google through these columns — the four calendar doors do that, against
    // the live entry — so there is no direction in which they can disagree with
    // Google and win. If they are stale, the sweep is behind; the entry is right.

    // (\`files_json\`, \`plan_json\`, \`tool_calls_json\`, \`preview_json\`) and for the

    // hundred rows a week whose only reader is the row above them.

    // ── \`from_calendar\`, AND WHY IT DECIDES WHAT A RE-SYNC MAY OVERWRITE ──────
    // Two kinds of meeting carry a \`google_event_id\` and they are NOT the same
    // record. One was typed in kwapso and pushed out; the other was read IN off
    // somebody's calendar. A re-sync that rewrote the title of both would quietly
    // undo a person's own words the moment Google's copy differed — which it
    // will, because the push writes "BERG-M0007 · Kickoff" and the calendar says
    // "Kickoff".
    //
    // So the flag records WHERE THE ROW CAME FROM, once, at insert. Google owns
    // the words of a row it authored; kwapso owns the words of a row it authored;
    // and the \`google_*\` mirror is refreshed on both, because those are Google's
    // facts either way. \`notes\` is never touched by a sync at all — it is the one
    // column in this module that only a person writes.
    //
    // ── AND A SHARE THAT IS ONE FILE ─────────────────────────────────────────
    // \`google_sources.kind\` splits what was one word. The owner: "In Drive, why
    // is it that it's only folder-wise? What if it had to be file-wise?" It did
    // not have to — a folder was only ever the thing the form could spell, which
    // made sharing one contract mean sharing everything filed beside it. The
    // fence does not change shape: what is named is the only thing readable, and
    // a named file is exactly one file.

-- trimmed".

    // parked for weeks is that nobody had said what the word meant.
    //
    // IT BELONGS TO AN APP, NOT TO AN ACCOUNT, and \`app_id\` is NOT NULL because
    // of it. The legacy app hung these off the app too (glide/RECONCILIATION.md:
    // 8 rows, "Name, type, a content URL and a thumbnail"), and the reason is the
    // one that whole file opens with: the customer is the owner, the APP is the
    // unit of work. A handover doc with no system to hand over is not a record
    // anybody could file.
    //
    // \`account_id\` IS DENORMALISED FROM THE APP, exactly as \`processes\`,
    // \`process_versions\` and \`process_steps\` carry it: written once from the
    // app at creation, never edited, so the account fence rides ONE clause with
    // no join the day a client is ever shown these. It is the fence built now,
    // switched off now (R21: every door on this module refuses a portal caller);
    // what it is NOT is a column somebody has to back-fill later under pressure.
    //

    // /media/internal/… URL the upload door mints) or a link we do not (a Loom
    // recording, a Google Doc, an API reference). The same sentence
    // \`brand_assets.file_url\` makes, and for the same reason help_attachments
    // gives at length: "here is the thing I mean" is ONE act, and two columns
    // would be two lists, two counts and two ways to be wrong about which is set.

    // "some have a picture worth showing" is a fact about the deliverable, not
    // about its material.

    // the doors went up, the screens went up, the tools went up — and on every
    // team created before that day, including staging and production, NO ROLE
    // HELD THE RIGHT. Not Admin, which is defined as full access and cannot be
    // edited afterwards to grant itself anything. The module was unreachable for
    // the entire agency.
    //
    // WHY IT HID. A brand-new team is fine: `createTeam` runs the migrations and
    // then the seed, and the seed walks TEAM_MODULES and writes the whole tall
    // sheet. So every test that builds a fresh database saw the right and passed.
    // The bug only exists for a team that was born BEFORE the module, which is
    // every real team and no test one. Add a portal fence that was switched off
    // and there was nothing to look at from either side, and a module can be
    // invisible to everybody for a week under a green build.
    //
    // THE SHAPE IS 0021's, WORD FOR WORD, and deliberately not a fresh idea:
    //   • `r.is_default` supplies all four rights, which is 1 for the locked
    //     Admin role and 0 for every role somebody built by hand. A migration
    //     must never hand out a sight nobody granted — a Client role does not
    //     quietly gain the handover shelf because we fixed our own bug.
    //   • `WHERE NOT EXISTS` makes it idempotent, which matters more than usual
    //     here: at least one staging team already has this row, inserted BY HAND
    //     on 18 Aug 2026 to get testing unblocked. This migration must meet that
    //     team and do nothing, not fail on a unique index and not write a second
    //     row. Same predicate-rides-the-write shape as R17.
    //   • A brand-new team never reaches it either, for the same reason: its
    //     seed has already written the row, and `NOT EXISTS` sees it.

    // emoji and a translation without a bespoke admin screen. Those are the
    // right things to want and this table carries every one of them. What it
    // does not do is flatten: 160 of the 246 names are DISTINCT and 124 belong
    // to exactly ONE app, so a team-wide vocabulary offers 160 options on a
    // ticket where 11 apply. Scoping `selectable_data` instead would have made
    // one group app-aware in a seam built to be uniform — `VOCABULARY_HOMES`
    // rewrites records on rename by (table, column) with no notion of a scope,
    // and `(type, value)` would stop identifying a row.
    //
    // ── AND WHY A TICKET STORES THE ID, NOT THE WORD ────────────────────────

    // Every existing vocabulary stores the WORD on the record, because the word

    //     privacy setting, which is a far larger thing to change than a
    //     knowledge base deserves.

    // THE AUDIT MODULE, FINISHED — every ruling from round two of the

    //
    // ── ONE TOOL PER STEP, not several. 0053 built a joining table because both
    // sides looked many. Both respondents had already answered otherwise, and
    // Aurora's reason is better than the shape I chose: "if it's multiple tools —
    // it's multiple steps". A step done in two systems has a handoff in the
    // middle of it, and the handoff is the thing a process map exists to show. So
    // the tool comes onto the step row. `process_step_tools` STAYS on disk with
    // nothing reading it, which is this codebase's rule for a retired structure;
    // its rows are carried across first so nothing is lost.
    //
    // ── HOW OFTEN, IN THE PERIOD THE PERSON SAYS IT IN. "Twice a day" and "forty
    // times a month" are the same fact, and asking somebody to convert it in
    // their head at the moment they are describing their own job is how a wrong
    // number gets typed. Stored as the pair (count, period); everything downstream
    // converts to months, which is where the arithmetic lives.
    //
    // ── THE COST IS FROZEN ONTO THE STEP. The owner, and this is the architecture
    // half of the tie-breaker: "even if the cost changes, they have to be retained
    // as they were at the time we recorded them". A saving computed from today's
    // rate would silently rewrite last year's agreed figure the day somebody gave
    // a payroll rise — the client's own number changing because of something the
    // client did, with nothing on screen to say so. `role_cents_per_hour` is
    // copied at write time and never recomputed.
    //
    // ── THE SHAPE OF A PROCESS, in three columns and no graph table. The owner's
    // own proposal: two nodes at the SAME position are a fork, and the branches
    // rejoin where a single node appears again. `branch_label` is the word on the
    // fork ("if rejected"), and `loops_back_to` is the arrow home — "feedback
    // loops are real. We need to find a way to include them." A graph table would
    // hold the same three facts and cost a join on every read.
    //
    // ── THE AUDIT DATE is what a saving is measured FROM (Aurora's ruling): one
    // date per map, Alex's visit, not "version 1". Versions stay, as NAMED
    // BOOKMARKS on the timeline — "Version 2, After CONFIA" is a readable name for
    // a moment — while the dated revisions below are what the arithmetic reads.
    //
    // ── REVISIONS. The map as it was on any day. One row per (step, date), so the
    // map "as of D" is the newest revision on or before D for each step key. The
    // existing versions are CONVERTED into revisions using each version's own
    // date, which is exactly what the owner asked for; a map with no versions
    // still gets one revision per step, dated at the map's own creation.
    //
    // ── LINKS. "Many times the last step of a process is the first step — or
    // connected to — another process." Loose, by ruling: naming a link changes no
    // duration, no frequency and no saving on either side.
    //
    // ── WAVES. What a client bought. No price column and no reference to our own
    // rates, because the owner ruled the internal money out of this module's first
    // version four separate times.
    //
    // ── DRAFTS. What the extraction produces and a person approves. It is NOT the
    // record: "Nothing — the draft is not the record" was the comprehension check
    // both respondents passed, and this table is why that sentence is true.

    // answered two.
    //
    // 1 · `origin` — WHICH FRONT DOOR. Four surfaces act as the SAME PERSON
    //     through the SAME gated doors: the agency app, the client portal, a
    //     personal access token on the MCP surface, and the in-app assistant
    //     acting as its caller. That identity is the security design and it is
    //     right — the agent never exceeds the rights of the person it acts for —
    //     but it made their rows byte-identical. So after a leaked token the
    //     first question an owner asks, WHICH of these did this, had no answer
    //     in the one table that exists to answer it. Stamped at the two public
    //     gateways and carried by `forwardToDoor`; see shared/workers/origin.ts.
    //
    // 2 · `verb` — WHAT KIND OF EVENT. `type` is a human sentence and stays one:
    //     it is what the feed shows and it is right for a reader. It is also 157
    //     distinct free-text literals across 139 call sites, so "every archive
    //     last quarter" was a LIKE over prose that silently missed `retired`,
    //     `withdrawn`, `taken down`, `switched off` and `binned` — the same
    //     event in five coats. Eight values, DERIVED from the sentence in the
    //     one writer (shared/workers/activity-verbs.ts) so no call site had to
    //     change and none can forget, and rot-checked so a sentence the mapping
    //     cannot read turns the build red rather than shipping unfindable.
    //
    // 3 · `idx_activity_actor_feed` — WHAT HAS THIS PERSON DONE. Three indexes
    //     stood on this table and none led with `creator_id`, so the actor-
    //     scoped question was a full scan and a sort of what 0023 calls "the
    //     fastest-growing table in a team's database by construction… the
    //     tens-of-millions one". With four write surfaces acting as one person,
    //     that is the query that matters most and it was the one shape the table
    //     was not built for — guaranteed to time out at exactly the moment it is
    //     first needed. Same shape as the two feed indexes beside it, for the
    //     same keyset (`created_at DESC, id DESC`), so an actor page is an index
    //     seek and page two is too.

    // no origin and no verb, and a backfill would have to INVENT the first one —
    // there is nothing on an old row that says which surface wrote it. A NULL
    // here reads as "written before the column existed", which is true, and is
    // distinguishable from the string `unknown`, which means "we asked and could
    // not tell". Two different facts, two different values, neither guessed.
    // (The verb COULD be backfilled from `type` by the same mapping; it is not,
