// A DRAFT PROCESS MAP — what an extraction proposed, before anybody agreed to it.
//
// ── THE ONE SENTENCE THIS FILE EXISTS TO KEEP TRUE ───────────────────────────
//
// THE DRAFT IS NOT THE RECORD. With eleven proposed steps sitting here and Alex
// having touched nothing, what is on the client's record is NOTHING — not a
// greyed-out step, not a step with a flag on it, nothing. That is why a proposal
// is JSON in `process_drafts.payload` rather than rows in `process_steps`: a
// draft normalised into the real table is one forgotten `WHERE` away from being
// the map, and the reader who forgets it is a savings roll-up quoting a client a
// figure derived from words a model put in their mouth.
//
// So there are exactly two writes in this file, and neither of them is an INSERT
// into a process table:
//   • `createDraft` writes ONE row to `process_drafts`;
//   • `applyDraft` calls `addStep` / `updateStep` from lib/processes.ts.
//
// APPLYING GOES THROUGH THE MAP'S OWN DOORS, deliberately and without exception.
// Those two functions freeze the role's hourly cost at write time, refuse a role
// or a tool belonging to another client, write the dated revision the history
// slider reads, refuse an edit to anything but the current version, and log the
// activity. An INSERT of my own would have to remember all six, and would be
// wrong about at least one of them the first time any of those rules changed.
// Every law those functions carry, a draft carries by construction.
//
// ── THE FENCE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every statement here ANDs `accountScopeClause` in, the same as lib/processes.ts
// and lib/accounts.ts: "did this query carry the caller's stamp?" has one place
// to look. `account_id` and `app_id` on a draft row are copied from the PROCESS
// row, read under that same fence — never from the request — so a draft cannot be
// filed against a client the caller cannot see.
