// Dropdown values ("Selectable data") module — the per-team dropdown VALUES,
// grouped by TYPE (e.g. "File type" → Image file / Video link…), in the team's
// OWN database. Admins manage them so the Ticket-type / Sprint-type pickers stay
// theirs to shape. Deactivate-only (ARCHITECTURE §4): a removed value is
// retired, never hard-deleted, so old rows that referenced it stay truthful.
//
// A VALUE CAN CARRY MORE THAN ITS WORD. Four nullable columns arrived with
// team-schema 0025, when the Delivery method page was retired and its ten
// programmes — a mark, a German name, what the block includes, how long it
// normally runs — were folded onto the sprint type, which had always been the
// same idea under another name. They are optional everywhere and null on almost
// every row: a File type has no standard length, and nothing here pretends
// otherwise.
