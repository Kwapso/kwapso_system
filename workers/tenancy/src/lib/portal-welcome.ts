// THE ONE EMAIL THIS WORKER SENDS TO A CLIENT.
//
// THE OWNER, 26 Aug 2026: "We need to add a switch at the time of granting
// portal access that would say whether an email is allowed or not. If it's
// checked at the time of granting portal access, then an email will be sent from
// our email address that we are using to send all other emails."
//
// WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE: nothing. Switching a login on wrote a row and told
// nobody, so the client learned their portal existed when a person at the agency
// remembered to type the address into a mail by hand — and the address is
// configuration exactly because nobody should be typing it from memory
// (portal.kwapso.app is a DIFFERENT live product of the owner's; the portal is
// client.kwapso.app / staging-client.kwapso.app). A hand-typed welcome is one
// wrong hostname away from telling a customer to sign in somewhere else.
//
// WHY IT IS OPT-IN AND NOT AUTOMATIC. Because sending mail to a customer is the
// agency's decision, not the software's. A login is sometimes switched on days
// before anybody means to tell the client — during a migration, ahead of a
// kick-off, to test the fence — and an email that goes out on the same keystroke
// takes that timing away. The switch sits beside the button so the choice is made
// at the moment of the act, with the consequence written next to it.
//
// R30: this is a `record` send. It carries a `ctaUrl`, that URL is built by the
// one helper, and its audience is `portal` — because the recipient decides which
// app the link opens, and this recipient has just become a client.
//
// BEST EFFORT, LIKE EVERY OTHER SEND. The grant has already committed when this
// runs; a mail failure must never undo a login. The caller is told what actually
// happened so it can say so rather than assume.
