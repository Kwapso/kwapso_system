// THE CLIENT'S OWN ORGANISATION — who does the work, what it costs them, and
// what they use to do it.
//
// A process map has always carried a single free-typed word for who does the
// work. Round two of the audit-module questions turned that word into records,
// because a saving can only be MONEY if the person doing the work has an hourly
// cost, and a cost belongs to a role rather than to a sentence on a map.
//
// FOUR SHAPES, and the reasons they are four:
//
//   • a DEPARTMENT is a part of the client's company;
//   • a ROLE is a job in it — and it can sit in SEVERAL departments, which is
//     the owner's ruling and not a modelling flourish: "there is a chance that
//     one role is doing things across multiple departments, especially in
//     slightly smaller companies";
//   • a PERSON on a role is a CONTACT WE ALREADY HAVE. There is deliberately no
//     people table here — a second address book is one that goes out of step
//     with the first;
//   • a TOOL is anything a step uses, digital or physical, and its price is
//     DATED so a map set to March does not read today's price.
//
// EVERYTHING IS PER CLIENT. Every read takes the caller's account scope and
// every write checks the record belongs to an account the caller may touch, so
// a client login reaches its own company's organisation and nothing else. That
// is checked at the door AND here, because the fence that matters is the one
// closest to the rows.
//
// DEACTIVATE, NEVER DELETE (ARCHITECTURE §4). A retired role is still the role a
// two-year-old map was drawn against, and a saving computed from a deleted role
// would silently become zero.
