// PROCESS MAPS — apps, the processes inside them, the versions cut over those,
// the steps each version is made of, and the conversation a client has on a map.
//
// This is the ONLY file in the worker that writes SQL against `apps`,
// `processes`, `process_versions`, `process_steps` or `process_comments` — the
// same boundary lib/accounts.ts draws around the customer spine, and for the same
// reason: every exported function here takes an `AccountScope` and ANDs its
// clause into the statement, so "did this query carry the caller's stamp?" is a
// question with exactly one place to look, and a machine-checkable one
// (test/account-leak.test.ts derives the account-scoped doors off disk and sends
// a burglar at every one of them).
//
// The fence rides the WHERE, never a pre-check. `SELECT … then UPDATE` is two
// steps a concurrent write slips between; `UPDATE … WHERE id = ? AND <scope>` is
// one statement D1 runs atomically, and zero rows changed is the refusal.
//
// WHY EVERY TABLE CARRIES `account_id`. It could be resolved by joining up to the
// app, and that is exactly what makes it wrong: a fence that needs a join is a
// fence the next reader forgets to join. Denormalised, every read here fences with
// the same one clause the accounts list uses, and an app's account is written once
// at creation and never edited (there is no move-app door — see the migration).

/* THERE IS NO STAFFING FENCE IN THIS QUERY, AND THAT IS THE RULING.
 *
 * The owner asked on 19 Aug 2026 for the agency side to be fenced, and the first
 * reading of that hid the ROW: an app with people on it disappeared from the
 * list for everybody else. He read it back the same day and narrowed it — "I
 * just want to make it such that people who are not main stakeholders of the app
 * can see it. They just can't enter the details screen of it and stuff like
 * that."
 *
 * So the fence is RECORD-LEVEL and not row-level: every app in the agency is
 * visible to anybody holding `processes:read`, and what a non-staffed reader
 * cannot have is the app's own material — its address, its four context fields,
 * its running cost and the two people lists. That decision is made once, on the
 * row, as `canOpen` in listApps below, and the withheld fields are LEFT OUT of
 * the payload rather than hidden by the screen: a field that never crosses the
 * wire cannot be read out of the network tab, and "the screen doesn't render it"
 * is not a permission.
 *
 * WHAT STILL LEAKS, said plainly because he asked and accepted it: the knowledge
 * base and the assistant read the same rows through their own doors, so an app's
 * name and the prose written about it can still be reached that way. He ruled
 * that acceptable for now ("I think that's fine for now"). It is written down

  // exponential time over the whole table for a handful of bytes.

  // existing rows get none — so this clause matches nothing yet, and it is here

/** THE STEP SHOULD NEVER HAVE EXISTED. The owner's ruling (25 Aug 2026), and a
 * different verb from `removeStep` on purpose: STOPPING is a fact about the
 * work — the row stays, its whole time becomes a saving — while DELETING is an
 * admission the row was a mistake, and a mistake must not leave a saving, a
 * slider stop or a baseline line behind it.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES, and why each refusal keeps a number honest:
 *   · a step CUT INTO ANY OTHER VERSION. An agreed version stays exactly as it
 *     was agreed; deleting only the live copy would make the step "vanish"
 *     between versions and silently drop it out of the savings join — the
 *     precise corruption `removeStep`'s header warns about.
 *   · a LOOP'S TARGET. Another step's "sends the work back to" would point at
 *     nothing, and the picture would draw an arrow to a step that is not there.
 *
 * BOTH predicates RIDE THE DELETE as NOT EXISTS clauses (CONCURRENCY.md: the
 * check that matters is the one in the same statement as the write — a loop
 * added between a read and a write must still refuse). The reads before it
 * exist only to name the refusal: "zero rows moved" alone cannot say WHICH rule
 * refused, and a person deserves the sentence, not the shrug.
 *
 * THE HISTORY GOES WITH IT. `process_step_revisions` rows for this step_key are
 * deleted too — an accidental step never officially existed, and rows left
 * behind would keep drawing it on the date slider for ever. This is the one
 * place in the module that hard-deletes, which is exactly why it is fenced to
 * the never-agreed, never-referenced case above.
 *
 * R17, delete-shaped: the row already being gone is zero rows moved — no
 * activity line, no ping, a quiet null. */

/** WHAT ONE APP HAS GIVEN BACK — hours, and what those hours are worth (8.13).
 *
 * BOTH halves are `listSavings`' own arithmetic, unchanged and un-recomputed:
 * the baseline minus the latest, step by step, priced by the CLIENT-role rate
 * frozen onto each step when it was written. This function used to add a SECOND
 * price — a role named on the process, looked up against the agency's own
 * internal rate card — and on 25 Aug 2026 the two arithmetics disagreed on the
 * owner's own screen: the map said €2,766.35 a month, this tab said 0.00 and
 * "no role attached", because the map's roles live on its STEPS. One
 * subtraction, one seam (R25's whole argument), so this carries the seam's money
 * through untouched and adds only the per-process rollup shape the panel draws.
 *
 * IT LIVES HERE BECAUSE OF THAT 25 AUG DECOUPLING, and the move is the proof of
 * it. Until 10 Sep 2026 it sat in `lib/internal-money.ts` beside the agency's own
 * cost cards, and the file's header said nothing a client login can reach may
 * import it. That file was deleted when the client retired the internal rates —
 * "kill the whole internal rates thing … for now i iwanna wipe it clean" — and
 * this function came here rather than going with it, because for the sixteen days
 * before that it had already read nothing but `listSavings`, three lines up. Its
 * door (`getAppMoney`) still refuses a portal caller: what a client may see of
 * this is `GET /api/tenancy/impact`, the same subtraction with the prices their
 * own visibility switch withholds.
 *
 * A PROCESS WITH NO PRICED STEP CONTRIBUTES NULL MONEY AND ITS FULL HOURS. The
 * asymmetry is deliberate and honest: the time is a measurement, true whether
 * or not anybody priced it; the money is an inference that needs a number
 * nobody has given yet, and null says so where a zero would claim the work is
 * free.
 *
 * R25 rides the object: the caption comes from `listSavings` and is passed on
 * word for word, because the money is made of the same estimates the hours are.
