// THE NIGHTLY OPS DIGEST — the half of the error store and the AI meter that
// was measured and never read.
//
// ── WHAT WAS WRONG ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Both of these systems were built properly and then left waiting for somebody
// to come and look.
//
//   · `error_logs` records every unexpected failure in eight workers and two
//     front doors, keeps ninety days of it, and has a resolve workflow. Nothing
//     tells anybody a row appeared. Measured on staging, 2026-09-05: 5,086 rows,
//     live yesterday, last resolved 2026-08-17 — nineteen days and about 1,200
//     rows ago. `D1_ERROR: no such column: spine` appeared five times on
//     2026-09-01 and nobody was told.
//
//   · `agent_usage` meters every AI unit a team spends, `consumeAiUnit` refuses
//     the turn at the cap, and `refundAiUnits` gives back what bought nothing.
//     Nothing fires BEFORE the cap. The first thing anybody learns is a person
//     saying "the assistant stopped working", which is the meter doing its job
//     and the estate finding out last.
//
// ── WHY IT LIVES HERE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Tenancy already owns the estate's nightly work, already holds the core
// binding, and already has the ONE alert channel somebody chose: `ALERT_TO`, the
// address the 80%-full database alarm goes to. This is deliberately NOT a new
// channel. A second address to configure is a second address to forget, and the
// question "where should alerts go" is the owner's to answer once — he has
// answered it, and this uses the answer.
//
// ── THE SHAPE, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO ────────────────────────────────────
//
// ONE MAIL A NIGHT, and none at all on a quiet night. Every part of it is a
// CHANGE — a signature seen for the first time, a signature that jumped, a team
// about to run out — never a standing total, because a nightly repeat of a
// standing problem is the mail people filter, and the thing you want unfiltered
// is the one that says something moved. That is the same ruling the size alarm
// follows (sharding.ts, "once per NEW alarm").
//
// EVERY READ IS BOUNDED and says so (R14). NOTHING IS WRITTEN: this reads three
// tables and sends one email. And it never throws into the cron — the caller
// records its failure the way it records the size alarm's (R12), because a
// digest that silently stopped is the same blindness this exists to end.
