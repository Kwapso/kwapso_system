// WAVES — what a client bought, and the sprints inside it.
//
// A WAVE IS A PACKAGE OF SPRINTS. The owner's example is the definition: "Alex
// sells Hogo a package — he maps their processes, builds two automations, they
// test it, he trains them. Three weeks later he sells a second, identical
// package." Two waves. They are told apart by their name and their dates, and by
// nothing else — a wave has NO KIND, ruled out in the same round: "a wave
// consists of multiple sprints. Sprints consist of multiple stories… It makes no
// sense to label a wave as a particular kind. A wave is a wave."
//
// FOUR THINGS THIS FILE IS CAREFUL ABOUT, and each of them is a decision that
// was already made rather than a preference of the code:
//
//   1 · NO MONEY. Nothing here reads `internal_rates` or `account_rates`, and
//       there is no price column on `waves` for it to read. The owner ruled the
//       money out of the first version — "leave the whole internal_rates and
//       account_rates out of V1. It's something new, too complex. We will
//       revisit this later. This is a fix decision." R24 is the standing law
//       underneath it: an internal number cannot reach the client's side, and
//       the defence that survives is the import nobody wrote.
//
//   2 · THE DATES ARE DERIVED AND STORED. `recalcWaveDates` is the ONE place a
//       wave's dates are decided — the earliest start and the latest end of the
//       live sprints in it — and every write that could move them calls it. They
//       are STORED rather than computed on read because a list of waves would
//       otherwise carry two sub-queries per row for a pair of numbers that
//       change a handful of times a year.
//
//   3 · A WAVE WITH NO SPRINTS IS ORDINARY. "Alex sells the wave, sprints get
//       planned afterwards." So both dates are nullable, a create takes no
//       sprint, and the recalc over an empty wave writes NULL rather than
//       refusing or leaving a stale pair of dates behind.
//
//   4 · OVERLAPPING SPRINTS WARN, THEY DO NOT REFUSE. Aurora's ruling — "warn,
//       but we can save it (it can happen…)". Two sprints of one package
//       genuinely can run over each other, so `setSprintWave` SAVES and hands
//       the overlap back for the screen to say out loud. A refusal here would
//       leave a team unable to record something that had already happened.
//
// EVERYTHING IS PER CLIENT. Every read takes the caller's account scope and
// every write checks the record belongs to an account the caller may touch —
// asserted here, closest to the rows, as well as at the door.
//
// DEACTIVATE, NEVER DELETE (ARCHITECTURE §4). A switched-off wave is still the
// package a two-year-old sprint was sold inside.
