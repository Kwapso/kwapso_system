// Member notifications — when something happens TO a member that they did NOT
// trigger (their role changes, they're removed, their invite is revoked), tell
// them. Required communication: the change affects them but they didn't make it,
// so they wouldn't otherwise know. Sent through the SAME branded template +
// auth-worker sender as login/invite emails, so every email looks identical.
//
// Best-effort by design: a failed notification must NEVER fail the action that
// triggered it, so each helper swallows its own errors (the action already
// happened and is logged in activity).

 * is the record this email is about; a CLIENT login gets none, and that is the
 * point of carrying the audience at all. The portal has no members screen, so the
 * only link that could exist for them is an agency URL, which is a door they may
 * not pass and a door an email must never advertise (R21). */
