// THE CUSTOMER SPINE — accounts, the links between them, and portal logins.
//
// This is the ONLY file in the worker that writes SQL against `accounts`,
// `account_links` or `portal_users`. That is not tidiness, it is the security
// boundary: every exported function here takes an `AccountScope` and ANDs its
// clause into the statement, so "did this query carry the caller's stamp?" is a
// question with one place to look — and a machine-checkable one
// (test/account-leak.test.ts asserts every exported reader/writer here takes the
// stamp, and then sends a burglar at every door that uses them).
//
// The fence rides the WHERE, it is never a pre-check. `SELECT … then UPDATE` is
// two steps a concurrent write can slip between; `UPDATE … WHERE id = ? AND
// <scope>` is one statement D1 runs atomically, and zero rows changed is the
// refusal. Same shape as the last-admin guard (CONCURRENCY rule 1).

/** WHAT AN ACCOUNT ROW SAYS, AND TO WHOM.
 *
 * Most of this row is the client's own information, which is exactly why the
 * portal opens the door: their name, address, reference, the people in it. Three
 * fields on it are not theirs at all — they are the AGENCY'S RECORD ABOUT THEM:
 *
 *   • `commercialsVisible` — our own switch governing what money they may see.
 *     A setting about somebody is not a setting for them to read.
 *   • `createdByName` / `editedByName` — which staff member opened the record and
 *     which one last touched it. The same promise the ticket row and the reply
 *     thread keep (SCOPE ch.06); there is no reason it changes table.
 *
 * THE REPO ALREADY SAYS THIS, ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THESE VERY FIELDS. The portal
 * has no activity feed, and shared/rules/registry.ts gives the reason: "an
 * account's history names the staff who edited the record and shows the agency's
 * own before/after values (commercial flags) — none of which is the
 * client's to read." The history was closed and the CURRENT values rode out on
 * the row underneath it, which is the whole finding: the portal drew none of
 * this, and the server sent all of it.
 *
 * The projection lives HERE rather than at the three call sites, because a
 * redaction you have to remember is one somebody forgets — the same argument
 * `ticketFence` makes for having no default. Every reader in this file goes
 * through this function, so the wire cannot disagree with it.
 *
 * The one thing that must NOT come through here is a WRITE's before-image: an
 * edit compares against what is stored, not against what the caller may see.
 * `accountRowOrThrow` below is the raw read updateAccount uses for that. */

/**
 * Move an account under another (or to the top, with `parentAccountId: null`).
 *
 * THE LOOP GUARD, as one statement. Attaching X under P closes a ring exactly
 * when X is already an ancestor-or-self of P, so the recursive walk up from P is
 * the test — and it rides the UPDATE's own WHERE. Two admins re-parenting at the
 * same instant therefore cannot both pass a check and both write: D1 serializes
 * the statements, the second one re-walks the tree the first one left behind, and
 * a ring is refused rather than created (CONCURRENCY rule 1). Zero rows changed =
 * refused, and the caller is told plainly which of the three reasons it was.
 *
 * AND THE WALK IS BOUNDED. The accounts table is the one self-nesting structure in
 * the base, so this is the one unbounded recursion — a chain N deep costs N steps
 * every time anyone moves anything. `depth` rides the CTE and stops it at
 * MAX_ACCOUNT_DEPTH. Hitting the ceiling REFUSES the move (`OR depth >= ?` in the
 * ring test): past it the walk can no longer prove the tree is ring-free, and a
 * guard that can't prove safety must fail closed, not fall through to "fine".
 *
 * RETURNS WHETHER ANYTHING ACTUALLY MOVED (R17). Putting a contact under the
 * company she is already at is not a move, and now writes nothing at all: no
 * UPDATE, no history row, and the route publishes no ping. It matters here more
 * than on a toggle, because this is the one control a person uses to CORRECT a
 * mistake — they open the picker, look at it, decide it was right after all, and
 * press Save. A record that grows an "Aurora moved Marta under Bergman S.A." line
 * every time somebody checks is a history nobody can read.
 *
 * WHY THE PREDICATE CANNOT RIDE THE UPDATE the way setAccountActive's does: zero
 * rows changed is ALREADY the refusal below. A no-op would come back as "that
 * would put the account inside itself", which is untrue and alarming. So the
 * before-image answers it, one statement earlier. Two people moving the same
 * contact at the same instant is unaffected — the ring guard is still the WRITE
 * itself, and the worst a lost race can cost is one duplicate history row saying
 * the same true thing twice, never a ring and never a wrong parent.
