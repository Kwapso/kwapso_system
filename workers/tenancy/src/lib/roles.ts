 *     so a caller holding member_roles:{create,edit} could mint Admin's twin.
 *   • INVITE someone to a role. `team_members:create` is a perfectly ordinary
 *     grant (an office manager invites people), and `GET /members` hands out
 *     every role id with an `isAdmin` flag on `team_members:read` alone. Invite a
 *     second address you own to the Admin role, accept it, and you hold every
 *     right in the team — no member_roles right involved at any point.
 *
 * So the ceiling is checked against the RIGHTS, not the role id: whatever sheet
 * you are handing out, every switch on it must already be on in your own. An
 * Admin holds everything, so an Admin is unaffected; nobody else can hand out a
 * right they do not personally hold. Fails closed — a caller whose own sheet
