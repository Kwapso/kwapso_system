/** PUT A CLIENT LOGIN ON THE TEAM — the other half of "give access".
 *
 * THE OWNER, 26 Aug 2026: he granted portal access to a contact, watched the
 * Portal access tab say "Can sign in", signed in at the client door, and was
 * told "There's nothing here for you yet. Someone at kwapso needs to switch your
 * access on." Both screens were telling the truth about different things.
 *
 * WHY IT HAPPENED. A client login is, by R21's own words, "an ordinary team
 * member holding an ordinary role" — the portal resolves which team's database
 * to ask from the caller's `current_team_id`, and every door behind it opens
 * with a `MemberGuard`. Granting portal access wrote a `portal_users` row and
 * nothing else, so the person had a fence and no membership: the portal could
 * not name a team, and `session.ts` fell to `no-access`.
 *
 * The seed script did BOTH acts — grant, then invite, then accept — which is why
 * every seeded client works and no real one could. The seed knew; the product
 * did not, and the button says "Switch their login on" as though it were one act.
 * It is one act now.
 *
 * WHY NOT AN INVITE. Because a client cannot accept one. The portal gateway
 * forwards a named allow-list that deliberately excludes `/api/tenancy/invites`
 * and `bootstrap` (R21), so the only way to spend a client's invite is to send
 * them to the AGENCY hostname — a door they may not pass — and let the 403 they
 * receive be the thing that enrols them. That is not a journey anybody would
 * design; it is what the seed's own comment describes as a curiosity.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT SAFE. The consent an invite exists to capture is already here in
 * a stronger form: the grant is a gated, confirmed act by a holder of
 * `portal_users:create`, on a person who is already on the account's own books
 * and has already signed in to this platform at least once, holding a role the
 * granter CHOSE. The grant door refuses an existing staff member outright, so
 * this can never quietly demote a colleague.
 *
 * UPSERT, like the accept path, because a removed member's row is deactivated
 * and never deleted: re-granting a login to somebody whose access was taken away
 * must revive them rather than silently do nothing. */
