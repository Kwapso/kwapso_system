// THE QUERY ENGINE — a structured request in, SQL out, and nothing in between
// that a caller wrote.
//
// The grammar it speaks lives in `@shared/workers/query-grammar` (read its
// header first: it says WHY there are two tools here instead of fifty). This
// file is the half that touches the database, and its whole job is the sentence
// the owner's ruling turns on:
//
//   THE MODEL FILLS IN A REQUEST. THIS CODE BUILDS THE STATEMENT.
//
// Three separate promises hold that up, and they are worth naming apart because
// breaking any one of them would look fine in a test that only checked the
// others:
//
//   1. THE TABLE comes from `QUERY_MODULES` and from nowhere else. A module name
//      that is not a key in that map is a 400 naming what the caller could have
//      asked for instead. There is no deny-list to keep current — `internal_rates`
//      is not queryable because it was never declared, not because something
//      remembered to forbid it (R24).
//   2. EVERY COLUMN comes from the module's own declared `fields`. A field name
//      that does not resolve is a 400. So `field` can only ever be one of a
//      fixed set of literals written in our own source.
//   3. EVERY VALUE is a BOUND PARAMETER. Not escaped, not interpolated — bound.
//      The one addition is the LIKE needle, which is bound AND passed through
//      `likeLiteral` first, because binding stops a value becoming SQL and does
//      nothing at all to stop it becoming a PATTERN.
//
// R14: the rows path PAGES by key (the collections behind it grow), and the
// grouped path is capped at GROUP_CAP with the truncation reported honestly.
// R20: the door validates every query parameter at the boundary; the clause
// shapes inside `where` are validated here, positionally, field by field.

 * back the database's spelling: `account_type`, `help_type`, `title_en`,
 * `resolved_at`. No screen on either front door reads this route, so the only
 * callers were the two machine surfaces — and a model that asks for
 * `fields: ["accountType"]` and reads `row.accountType` got `undefined` out of
 * a 200, which is indistinguishable from an empty column.
 *
 * The TYPE is honoured on the way out too, for the one case where SQLite's
 * storage and the published type disagree: a `boolean` field is a 0 or a 1 in
 * the column, and `commercialsVisible: 0` is a number a reader has to know to
