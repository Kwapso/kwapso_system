// THE BADGE DOOR — how many of each thing hang off ONE record, in one round
// trip, before anybody has clicked a tab.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR. A record's collection tabs were badged out of a sidecar cache
// key that only the tab PANEL's own list fetch ever primed, so the number
// appeared the moment you opened the tab and not one moment sooner — and
// `formatCount` renders nothing for "none" AND nothing for "not loaded", so an
// unopened tab was indistinguishable from an empty one. This door answers the
// COUNTS eagerly; the ROWS stay lazy, which is the whole shape of the fix.
//
// IT REFUSES A CLIENT LOGIN (R21), first and unconditionally. Everything it
// counts is the agency's own working picture of a customer — how many systems we
// have built them, how much work we have sold, how many requests are open, what
// their rate card holds. A client has their own front door with its own screens;
// this is not one of them, and a door not named on the portal's allow-list is
// still served to that same person at the agency origin.
//
// IT HAS NO SINGLE GATE, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN. R18's sentence is that a
// cross-module read carries the CALLER'S rights, and one record's children cross
// as many modules as it has tabs. Gating the whole door on one of them would
// pick a winner: gate an account's counts on `processes` and somebody who only
// does support loses their to-do badge; gate them on `todos` and a developer
// loses the app one. So each COLLECTION asks for its own module's read right and
// comes back `null` without it — "you may not look" and "there are none" are
// different sentences, and the second would be a confident lie about the first.
//
// AND IT COUNTS NOTHING ITSELF. Every figure is the module's own existing
// `count*` function over the same question its list asks, so the badge and the
// list it reveals are one expression rather than two that happen to agree.
//
// WHICH FIGURES THIS WORKER OWES is read off `shared/record-counts.ts` rather
// than written here: the same registry the screen reads to know which doors to
// ask, and the live layer reads to know which pings move which record's counts.
// Three hand-written copies of one list is how two of them come to disagree.
