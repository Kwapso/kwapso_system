// THE CLIENT'S OWN ORGANISATION — the doors. Departments, roles, the people
// holding them, and the tools they use.
//
// EVERY DOOR HERE IS OPEN TO A CLIENT LOGIN, deliberately, and that is the one
// thing to read carefully. R21's usual answer is `refusePortalCaller`; here the
// owner ruled the other way in round two, ticking all four: a contact sees "the
// departments and roles we recorded for them", "the people we have listed
// against each role", "their tools and what those tools cost" and their waves.
//
// So these doors resolve the ACCOUNT FENCE instead of refusing — `callerScope`
// on every one, handed to every read and every write, and the lib asserts the
// record's own account is inside that scope before it writes. Staff see every
// client; a contact sees their own company and nothing else. The fence is the
// permission here, which is why it is never optional and never defaulted.
//
// WHAT A CLIENT STILL DOES NOT SEE: the history. Every activity row here names
// the staff member who made the change, and a role's carries what an hour costs
// — costs that sit side by side across one company. Both are withheld by
// PORTAL_ACTIVITY_FENCE, which says why at length.
//
// THE MODULE IS `processes`, because that is the only reason any of this exists:
// a role carries an hourly cost so a step's minutes can become money, and a tool
// carries a price so a step that replaces it can be subtracted. Whoever may read
// a client's process map is exactly whoever may read its cast list.
