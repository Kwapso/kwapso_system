// EXTRACTION — the doors. Read a call, propose a process map, review it, apply
// what survived.
//
// Every handler here does the same four things, in the same order, exactly as
// the process-map doors beside it:
//   gate on the caller's ROLE (R10) → decide about CLIENT LOGINS (R21) →
//   validate at the boundary, positionally (R20) → publish (R1).
//
// ── THE R21 DECISION, AND IT IS THE SAME ON EVERY DOOR HERE ──────────────────
//
// Every one of them refuses a portal caller. There is no read here a client may
// make, and that is a stronger statement than the process-map doors make about
// themselves, so it is worth the sentence:
//
//   • EXTRACTING is the agency's own work. A client does not have their own
//     conversation read and turned into a map by pressing a button; that is what
//     they are paying us to do, and the review in the middle of it is the whole
//     value of the service.
//   • A DRAFT HOLDS THE RAW CALL. `source_text` is a transcript — half of it is
//     us talking about them, and none of it has been reviewed by anybody.
//     Serving that back to the client is the disclosure this app is most
//     exposed to, and it would not even be a permissions bug: a client login is
//     an ordinary team member holding an ordinary role, and the agency gateway
//     forwards by PREFIX. "A client would never call it" is precisely the
//     assumption two leaks in this codebase were built on.
//
// So `refusePortalCaller` opens the fence on all five, including the two GETs.
//
// ── WHAT A DOOR HERE MAY NOT DO ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Write a step. Not one of these handlers touches `process_steps`: applying goes
// through `applyDraft`, which goes through `addStep` / `updateStep`. The draft is
// not the record, and a door that could shortcut that is a door that eventually
// does.
