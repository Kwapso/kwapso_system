// THE QUERY DOORS — two of them, standing in for fifty tools.
//
// `GET /api/tenancy/query/describe` says what a module HAS: its fields, their
// types, and the values an enum accepts (including the ones the TEAM edits,
// read live off their own dropdown list).
// `GET /api/tenancy/query`          asks a module something: filters, an
// optional grouped count, an order, a page.
//
// WHY THEY LIVE ON TENANCY. The team database is ONE database per team, and
// this worker already serves the app's only other generic, module-spanning read
// — the activity feed, which resolves a module GATE from the table being asked
// about (`ACTIVITY_GATE_MAP`) rather than naming one at the door. These doors
// are the same shape one step further along: the module named in the request
// resolves to a table AND to the permission that table's own list door gates on,
// so nothing here is readable that was not already readable one screen at a time.
//
// WHAT THEY GRANT: nothing. `requireRight(<the module's own right>, "read")` is
// the same gate the module's list door opens with, and `refusePortalCaller`
// closes the door on a client login outright (R21) — a generic reader over the
// agency's own material is not a thing a client login is ever handed, and
// refusing at the door is what survives somebody adding a line to the portal
// gateway's allow-list.
