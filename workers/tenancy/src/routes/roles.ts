/** GET /api/tenancy/roles/export — the team's roles as a CSV download carrying
 * EVERY captured field (the owner's export rule): the role row, the FULL
 * permission matrix flattened to one `<module>.<right>` yes/no column each
 * (spreadsheet-filterable), and the whole audit block. The cross-cutting rule:
 * EXPORT NEEDS READ (import needs create). Team-bound by construction
 * (teamContext → the caller's own team database). Leading columns still match
 * the import format (title, description) so the file round-trips.
 *
 * AND IT IS WHOLE, OR IT IS AN ERROR — the accounts door's rule, and this door
 * needed it more than any other. Three reads sit behind one file here, and two of
 * them could truncate: the role rows came back on the SCREEN cap (a thousand,
 * because the export borrowed the list reader), and the permission sheet is roles
 * × modules. The second one is the dangerous half. `buildPermissionValue` renders
 * a role with no rows as every right OFF, and the columns lead with the import
 * format — so a short file was not merely missing roles, it was an instruction to
 * REVOKE the ones it kept. Refused now, at the door, before a single line is
 * written: the exact server count against what the list returned, and the
 * permission read's own `complete`. */
