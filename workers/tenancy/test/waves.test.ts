// WAVES — what a client bought, and the sprints inside it.
//
// FIVE THINGS HAVE TO HOLD, and every one of them fails SILENTLY if it does not.
// That is the whole reason this suite runs the real migrations into real SQLite
// and calls the shipped lib functions rather than mocking them: a wave's dates
// are a derived number that looks exactly as convincing when it is stale.
//
//   1 · THE DATES COME FROM THE SPRINTS, AND THEY MOVE. `starts_on` / `ends_on`
//       are STORED, so nothing recomputes them on a read — which means a recalc
//       that was skipped leaves a wave quoting dates no sprint in it has, on a
//       screen that looks finished. Moving a sprint OUT is the sharper half: a
//       recalc that only ever wrote a value would leave the old pair sitting
//       there, and "the wave still runs to April" would be a fact about a sprint
//       that is now in a different package.
//
//   2 · A WAVE WITH NO SPRINTS IS ORDINARY. "Alex sells the wave, sprints get
//       planned afterwards." Its dates are NULL, and null is the honest answer —
//       a read that refused those waves, or a write that demanded a sprint,
//       would break the moment this module is actually used for.
//
//   3 · OVERLAPPING SPRINTS SAVE, AND SAY SO. Aurora ruled it: "warn, but we can
//       save it (it can happen…)". So the assertion is deliberately two-sided —
//       the warning is reported AND the row landed. A door that refused would
//       pass a test that only looked for the warning.
//
//   4 · ANOTHER CLIENT'S SPRINT CANNOT BE PUT IN THIS CLIENT'S WAVE. The account
//       fence stops a caller REACHING another client's rows; it does not stop a
//       staff member — who can see both — writing Bergman's sprint into a
//       package Delaval bought. Nothing on the screen would say so: a wave shows
//       the sprint's NAME.
//
//   5 · DEACTIVATING TWICE MOVES ZERO ROWS (R17). The second click must write no
//       activity row and announce nothing.
//
// Real migrations, real SQLite, real lib functions.
