//
// WHY THIS IS A DOOR TEST AND NOT A SCREEN ONE. Every claim below is about SQL,
// and this suite runs the real migration in real SQLite — which is the only
// thing that could have caught what the first draft got wrong. It preferred the
// link that agrees with the parent pointer, in the subquery's ORDER BY, and
// SQLite refuses an outer correlated reference THERE while allowing it in the
// WHERE: a statement that parses, typechecks, and 500s on the first request. A
// mocked door would have shipped it.
