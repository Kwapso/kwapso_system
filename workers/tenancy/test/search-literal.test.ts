// A SEARCH BOX IS NOT A PATTERN BOX.
//
// Binding a needle as a parameter stops it becoming SQL. It does NOT stop it
// becoming a LIKE PATTERN, and those are two different escapes — the accounts
// search wrapped the caller's text in `%…%` and handed it straight to LIKE.
//
// Two things follow, and both are here. A person searching for the literal
// "PO_1" silently matched "PO-1" and "POx1": a filter quietly answering a
// different question, which is the defect R19 exists for wearing a wildcard. And
// SQLite compares a LIKE pattern by RECURSING at every `%`, so a needle of
// alternating `%` and letters is a handful of bytes in a query string that costs
// the worker exponential time over the whole table.
//
// Against a real SQLite database, because "does LIKE treat this as a wildcard" is
// a question only the engine can answer.
