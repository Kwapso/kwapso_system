// repeatable write into the shared core database. None of that is retention:
// three tables in core are written by callers who are not signed in at all (a
// sign-in code and its ledger row are minted for anyone who types an email
// address), and their totals were bounded by nothing but how long the internet
// stayed bored. Nothing has ever deleted a spent code, a spent send or a session
// that expired last spring.
//
// These run against real SQLite with the real migrations, because the whole
// question is which rows a WHERE clause selects — and a stub would agree with
// whatever clause it was handed.
