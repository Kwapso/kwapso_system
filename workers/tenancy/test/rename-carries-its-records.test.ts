// A RENAME IS A RENAME — the dropdown value moves and the records move with it.
//
// The fault: a record stores its dropdown value as the WORD, so the spelling is
// the only thing joining a record to its vocabulary. Renaming the row alone left
// 107 tickets saying "Extra" while the group had moved on — their tab gone,
// their mark gone, a new tab beside them counting nothing.
//
// The asymmetry is what made it hard to see, and it is asserted here rather than
// described: the MARK was always a lookup (it lives only on the dropdown row and
// is read by the word), so changing an emoji already reached every record. Only
// the WORD was a join key, and only the word needed carrying.
