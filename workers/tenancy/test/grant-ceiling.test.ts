// NO GRANTING WHAT YOU WERE NOT GIVEN — the invariant `setRolePermissions` has
// stated in words since it was written, now enforced on every door that hands
// rights to somebody.
//
// The hole this suite was written for: `member_roles:update` was guarded against
// the caller widening their OWN role (`roleId === guard.roleId`), and that guard
// names ONE role id, so two doors walked straight around it.
//
//   • INVITE. `POST /api/tenancy/invites` gates on `team_members:create` — an
//     ordinary grant — and applies the named role verbatim on accept. `GET
//     /members` hands out every role id with an `isAdmin` flag on
//     `team_members:read` alone. So: read the Admin role's id, invite a second
//     address you own to it, accept, and you hold every right in the team,
//     without ever touching a member_roles right.
//   • CREATE A ROLE with a full matrix. The self-grant check compares against the
//     caller's role id, and a role that did not exist a moment ago never matches.
//
// Run against a REAL team database with the REAL migrations and the REAL seed,
// because the guard's whole question is "what does role_permissions actually
// say" — a mocked sheet would agree with the guard whether it was right or not.
