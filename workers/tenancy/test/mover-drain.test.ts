// THE ONE RELIEF VALVE HAS TO SURVIVE THE SIZE IT EXISTS FOR.
//
// The module mover is what an 80% size alarm tells you to run, so it is only ever
// pointed at a table that has grown too big for its database. Two of its steps
// could not survive that:
//
//   • THE COPY walked `LIMIT 250 OFFSET n`. SQLite reaches offset four million by
//     reading and discarding four million rows, so copying a big table cost O(n²)
//     reads — and the window shifted under any concurrent write, so rows could be
//     copied twice or skipped and step 3 would only notice afterwards.
//   • THE EMPTYING was one statement: `DELETE FROM <table>;`. D1 refuses a
//     statement past 30 seconds, so on a multi-million-row table that DELETE was
//     the step guaranteed to fail — AFTER the routing flip had committed. Routing
//     flipped means `resolveModuleDatabases` returns BOTH databases and every read
//     is a merged read, so a row left behind is a row returned twice: a doubled
//     list, a doubled count, doubled money, and nothing anywhere saying so.
//
// This suite reads the source, because both bugs are shapes rather than values —
// proving them behaviourally would mean standing up two real D1 databases with a
// million rows in them.
