  // activity door's module gate. Without it the help burglary below would be
  // refused by the gate and pass while the fence was wide open — a green test
  // asserting the wrong thing.
  // `todos` is the one module on this list a REAL Client role is meant to hold:
  // a to-do is aimed at the client and they complete it themselves. So the
  // burglar holding it is not a worst case at all — it is the ordinary case, and
  // what stops them reading Bergman's homework is the account fence rather than
  // a refusal.
  // `contacts` is on the list for the burglar's sake, most of all: the address
  // book is now its own module, and a burglar refused by their ROLE would prove
  // nothing about whether the FENCE holds. Holding it is the worst case, which
  // is what this harness is for.
  // `work` is here for exactly that reason and no other. No real Client role
  // would ever hold it — every work-engine door refuses a portal caller outright
  // — which is precisely why the burglar must: a refusal proved against a caller
  // whose ROLE already stopped them proves nothing about the door.
  // `all_tasks` (4.9) is on the list for BOTH reasons at once. For the staff
  // caller it is the ordinary case — this harness's suites are about what the
  // task doors DO, and a role missing the right would narrow every one of them
  // to one person's list and quietly turn six view tests into assertions about
  // an empty array. For the burglar it is the worst case: the widest sight of
  // our own admin a role can be given, so a refusal proved with it held is a
  // refusal proved by the DOOR. The narrowing itself is proved separately, by a
  // caller who deliberately does not hold it (todos-tasks.test.ts).
  // `deliverables` (8.7) is here for BOTH reasons too. For the staff caller it
  // is the ordinary case — the app's handover shelf is one of the collections a
  // record's badge door owes, and a role missing the right would turn that into
  // an assertion about a `null`. For the burglar it is the worst case: the
  // material IS the client's, so a client role plausibly holding it is the very
  // thing the door's refusal has to survive. The narrowing itself is proved
  // separately, by a caller whose right is taken away (deliverables.test.ts).
