// THE FILTERED COUNT — "filter by type, and the count doesn't change".
//
// That sentence, from a manager on staging, is two defects standing on each
// other. The screen's filters were the library frame's, so they narrowed the
// fifty rows the browser had loaded; and the count above them was the door's
// exact COUNT(*) over the whole collection, which is correct and which therefore
// never moved. Both numbers true, neither about the question being asked.
//
// The filters are the DOOR's now, and this proves the half a source scan cannot
// see: that narrowing an accounts read narrows its `total` by exactly the same
// sentence. Against a real SQLite database running the real team migrations,
// because "do the rows and the count agree" is a question only the engine can
// answer — the two clauses are built once (`accountsWhere`) precisely so they
// cannot drift, and a test that trusted that would be testing the comment.
