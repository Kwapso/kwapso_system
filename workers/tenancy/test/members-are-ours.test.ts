// A CLIENT LOGIN IS A MEMBER, AND IT MUST NOT BE AN ASSIGNEE.
//
// Grant → invite → accept is the only way to make a working portal login, so a
// client contact holds an ordinary role and sits in `team_members` beside our own
// staff. Nothing on the membership row says which is which — and every people
// picker in the agency app is built from that list, so "Who's doing it" on a new
// task was offering the agency's clients by name. The owner found it by opening
// one.
//
// The fix has two halves and they are checked in two places: the DOOR says which
// members are client logins (here), and the front door decides what to do about
// it (web/test/assignable-members.test.ts). This suite is the first half — the
// fact has to be true before anything can act on it.
//
// It runs the REAL handler against a real SQLite database with the real
// migrations, through the shared spine harness, because the fact comes off the
// customer spine and a mocked query would only prove the mock.
