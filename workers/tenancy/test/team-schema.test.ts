// A MODULE REACHES THE TEAMS THAT ALREADY EXIST, OR IT REACHES NOBODY.

// Earned on 18 August 2026 by `deliverables`. Migration 0036 created the table,
// the module went into TEAM_MODULES, and the doors, screens and tools all
// shipped — with no `role_permissions` back-fill. Every team born before that
// day therefore held the right on NO role, not even the locked Admin, which is
// defined as full access and cannot be edited afterwards to grant itself
// anything. The module was invisible to the entire agency for a week.
//
// IT HID BECAUSE EVERY TEST BUILDS A FRESH TEAM. `createTeam` runs the
// migrations and then the seed, and the seed walks TEAM_MODULES and writes the
// whole tall sheet — so a database built in a test has the right and a database
// belonging to a real customer does not. The one shape no fixture had was "a
// team that predates the module", which is the shape every production team has.
//
// So this is the general version, derived from TEAM_MODULES rather than from a
// list somebody keeps. THE ORIGINALS are the exception, and they are data with a
// reason: the modules that already existed when 0001 shipped were granted by the
// first seed every team ever ran, so there is no earlier team for a back-fill to
// reach. Anything added since is a module some team predates.
