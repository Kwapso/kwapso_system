//
// `users` lives in the GLOBAL core database and is written by two workers. That
// is fine, and it is only fine while the split holds: **auth owns identity, and
// tenancy writes exactly one column.** auth creates the row, changes the email
// and writes the profile; tenancy writes `current_team_id` (plus its `updated_at`
// stamp) because "which team is this person looking at" is a tenancy fact that
// happens to live on an auth-owned row.
//
// Nothing enforced that. A tenancy handler that started writing `users.email` —
// on an email-change flow, say, or a "tidy up the name while we're here" — would
// give two workers an authoritative opinion about one field, and the loser of
// the race would be silent. There is no log that explains that class of bug
// afterwards, which is exactly why it is worth a test rather than a paragraph.
//
// The split is stated for a human in RESILIENCE.md § "Who owns a fact"; this is
// the half that fails the build.

// document ends with a remember-to: "If you add a second writer to a table, add a
// row above." In a repo whose whole philosophy is that a rule with no check is
// not a law, that sentence was the law. A tenancy handler that started writing a
// content-owned column, or a fifth shared table nobody listed, ships green — and
// the failure mode is the one the document opens by describing: two components
// with an authoritative opinion about one fact, the loser of the race silent, and
// no log that explains it afterwards.
//
// So the SET is derived and compared with the document, both ways. A new shared
// writer turns the build red until somebody writes down the split; a documented
// row whose table stopped being shared turns it red too, so the list can only
// shrink honestly rather than becoming a record of what used to be true.
