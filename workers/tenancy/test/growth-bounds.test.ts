// A TABLE SOMEBODY CAN GROW HAS A CEILING AT THE WRITE AND A LIMIT AT THE READ.
//
// R14 bounds every list read, and a bound is only a promise about the ROWS in
// front of it. Two tables here had the promise on neither end:
//
//   • `member_roles`. The create door was uncapped, and two HOT reads pulled the
//     title lookup with no LIMIT at all — the members list and the invitations
//     list, both opened by everyone. So an ordinary `member_roles:create` grant
//     (the one an office manager gets) set the size of somebody else's screen,
//     and of the roles CSV export, which reads roles × modules.
//   • `screens`. The key is a screen key and this worker cannot check it against
//     a list — it treats a recipe as opaque on purpose, because the web app owns
//     the shape. So any string minted a row, each carrying up to 64 KB, and the
//     read behind EVERY page load pulled all of them back unbounded.
//
// Both ends are asserted here: the door refuses at the ceiling, and the read that
// consumes the table carries a LIMIT. Against a real SQLite database, through the
// shipped handlers.
