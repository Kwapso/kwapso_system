// THE QUERY DOOR ANSWERS IN THE WORDS IT PUBLISHED.
//
// `query_records` is the ONE read the assistant has for most of this app: nine
// `list_*` tools were retired into it (REPLACED_BY_QUERY), and no screen on
// either front door reads this route at all — its only callers are the two
// machine surfaces. So the vocabulary it publishes IS its contract, and there is
// no human looking at a screen who would notice the contract being broken.
//
// TWO THINGS DRIFTED, both invisible to every other check here, both found by
// driving the real door on staging on 30 Aug 2026:
//
//   1 · THE ROWS CAME BACK IN THE DATABASE'S SPELLING. `describe_module`
//       advertises `accountType`, `helpType`, `resolvedAt`; filters, `sort` and
//       `groupBy` all take those names; and the ROWS came back keyed
//       `account_type`, `help_type`, `resolved_at`, `title_en`. The grouped
//       answer already mapped back (`[f.name, r[f.column]]`) — ten lines above
//       the row path that did not — which is what says this was an omission and
//       never a decision. A caller that asks for `fields: ["accountType"]` and
//       reads `row.accountType` gets `undefined` from a 200.
//
//   2 · A DECLARED VALUE THE COLUMN NEVER HOLDS. `accountType` was declared
//       `["entity", "person"]`; the column holds `entity` and `individual` —
//       the spelling the create door validates, the seed writes and the door's
//       own `groupBy` hands back. So the assistant, told to filter by `person`,
//       got `200 total=0` with no `unmatched` beside it: a confident, false
//       "this team has no contacts" over 108 real people. Asking for
//       `individual` — the value the same door had just returned — was a 400.
//
// WHAT MAKES THESE CHECKS RATHER THAN CLAIMS. Each is grounded in an oracle the
// grammar does not control: the ROW test reads the keys the real door really
// returned, and the VALUES test reads `SELECT DISTINCT` off the database the
// harness seeded. Both were run against the unfixed code first and both went
// red, naming `account_type` and `individual` respectively.
//
// SCOPE, said plainly: the values test can only judge a column the fixture
// actually fills, so it is a floor and not a census. The wider instrument is
// scripts/query-bench.mjs, which runs this same engine over the real staging
// rows and prints the `unmatched` values a request named nothing with — the
// "NAMED NOTHING" line — which is how this one was found.
