// THE CHAIN THE MONEY HANGS ON: step → client role → frozen rate.
//
// The model moved on 25 Aug 2026. The first cut priced a process by ONE role
// named on the process against the internal rate card, and the step work then
// gave every STEP a client role whose rate is FROZEN onto the row when it is
// written — the one savings seam prices the subtraction step by step, and the
// process screen shows that figure. For six days appMoneyBack still ran the old
// arithmetic beside it, and the two disagreed on the owner's own screen:
// €2,766.35 on the map, 0.00 on the Value tab, "no role attached" about a map
// with four priced steps. One subtraction, one seam; this suite now proves the
// rollup IS the seam's answer, through the real doors against a real database:
// a map with no priced step, a step that gains a priced role, a rate of zero,
// and — the owner's ruling — a rate rise that must NOT move an agreed figure.
