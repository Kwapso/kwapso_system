// THE PER-REQUEST MEMOS, AND THE ONE PROPERTY THAT MAKES THEM SAFE.
//
// `hasRight` and `accountScope` are both resolved once per request now, keyed on
// the guard OBJECT. That turns seven permission reads and seven fence reads on
// one record-screen open into one of each — every one of those was a separate
// HTTPS request to the D1 REST API, because a team database is created at
// runtime and cannot be a native binding (ARCHITECTURE.md).
//
// The saving is not what needs a test. The SAFETY does. A memo on a permission
// answer inside a long-lived Worker isolate is a tenant-isolation bug waiting to
// be written: the isolate serves many callers, so anything keyed on a string
// (`roleId`, `userId`, `teamId`) survives the request that made it and can hand
// the next caller the previous caller's rights. The whole defence is that the
// key is an object whose lifetime IS the request — `requireMember` builds a
// fresh literal every time — so two requests can never collide on it.
//
// That is an invariant nothing else states, which is exactly the kind that rots.
// These tests state it: two guards, same role, same module, must each pay for
// their own read and must each get their own answer.
