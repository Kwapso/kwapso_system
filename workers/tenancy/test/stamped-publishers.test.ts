// HALF-STAMPED IS SILENTLY DEAF. A resource in SCOPE_STAMPED_RESOURCES is one
// whose pings a fenced portal listener may only hear when the publisher NAMED
// the account (`mayHearChange` fails closed on a missing scope) — so a publish
// site that forgets the sixth argument does not leak, it goes quiet: the
// client's screen simply stops updating, with no symptom anywhere. That is the
// exact no-alarm failure shape R15 exists for, one layer down.
//
// Earned on 26 Aug 2026, when `processes` and `account_rates` joined the
// stamped set so the portal's Impact screen could hear its own subject: the
// two resources had SIXTEEN publish sites between them, and a sweep that fixed
// fifteen would have shipped green. So the census is derived, not remembered:
// every `publishChange` whose resource literal is in the stamped set must pass
// a sixth argument, read straight off the workers' source.
//
// `account_rates` LEFT THE STAMPED SET ON 10 SEP 2026 with the rate card itself
// ("the whole account rates also killed it"). Nothing about this census changed,
// which is the property worth noticing: the stamped set is read off
// shared/workers/account-scope.ts at run time and the publish sites are read off
// disk, so a resource leaving is a resource with no sites left to judge rather
// than a line anybody had to remember to delete here.
