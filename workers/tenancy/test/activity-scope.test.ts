// `?scope=user` with no `id` matched no branch, left the WHERE empty, and handed
// the whole team's cross-module history (with before→after values) to anyone with
// team_members:read. A scan that asserts "the clause exists" stays green through
// that. So this test RUNS the reader over every scope/id shape it can be called
// with and asserts the SQL that comes out is never an unfiltered whole-table read.
