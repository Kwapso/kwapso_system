// THE DEPLOY'S MIGRATION GATE — what it promises, locked.
//
// `scripts/check-team-migrations.mjs` refuses a deploy while a live team database
// is behind `TEAM_MIGRATIONS`. It is a PIPELINE GATE, not a Law of the Base — it
// asks about the live estate — so it has no RULES.md entry and no registry row.
// What it does have is a fistful of properties that were each proved by hand on
// one afternoon (27 Aug 2026), and a proof nobody can re-run is a proof that
// decays. This is that afternoon, made repeatable, with no network in it.
//
// IT LIVES HERE, beside the robot rather than in web/test/ with the laws,
// because the ORACLE lives here. The gate parses `TEAM_MIGRATIONS` out of the
// file; this suite IMPORTS it. Two different routes to one answer is what makes
// the comparison worth anything — a test that re-derived it the same way would
// only prove the parser agrees with itself.
//
// It also holds the deploy chain's OTHER positional property — the account gate
// (`scripts/check-cloudflare-account.mjs`) must run before the first upload —
// because that check derives its answer from the same worker's wrangler config,
// and because a positional property has now been silently falsified twice. They
// belong where the next person will find them together.
//
// The four properties, and what each one is standing in front of:
//
//   1. THE LATEST VERSION the gate computes is the one the ROBOT computes. If
//      these ever disagree the gate is measuring against a migration nobody is
//      rolling out.
//   2. A `version:` OUTSIDE the array is invisible. This is the accidental
//      adversarial test: the planning session's first mutation proof landed past
//      the array's close and the gate correctly reported OK. A regex would have
//      gone red for a reason nobody could have acted on, which is this repo's
//      other recurring failure — a check that fails for the wrong reason teaches
//      people to ignore it just as fast as one that never fails at all.
//   3. THE POPULATION IS THE ROBOT'S. Proved against real SQLite rather than by
//      matching text: a `failed` team and a deactivated team must be invisible
//      to the gate, because they are invisible to the remedy. This is the whole
//      trap — a gate that refuses over a team nobody can migrate is a gate
//      somebody switches off, and then the estate has neither.
//   4. A WAIVER CANNOT ROT. It is the one deliberate hole, so it is the one that
//      has to be nailed to the floor: wrong team, wrong version, past its date,
//      or belonging to the other environment, and it stops excusing anything.
