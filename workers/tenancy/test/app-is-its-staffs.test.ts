// AN APP WITH PEOPLE ON IT KEEPS ITS MATERIAL FOR THEM.
//
// THE RULING, IN TWO STEPS, AND THE SECOND ONE IS THE RULE. Asked on 19 Aug 2026
// whether the agency side should be fenced too — any team member with the apps
// right seeing every app, running cost included — the owner said "yes of course",
// and the first reading of that hid the ROW: an app with staff on it disappeared
// from the list for everybody else. He read it back the same day and narrowed it:
//
//   "I just want to make it such that people who are not main stakeholders of the
//    app can see it. They just can't enter the details screen of it and stuff
//    like that... if somebody sends them a link to the app, it just throws them
//    out."
//
// So the fence is RECORD-LEVEL, not row-level. Everybody sees every app. What a
// non-staffed reader does not get is the app's own material: its address, its
// four context fields, its running cost, and the two people lists. That is
// decided on the row (`canOpen`) and the withheld fields are LEFT OUT of the
// payload — a field that never crosses the wire cannot be read out of the network
// tab, and "the screen doesn't render it" is not a permission.
//
// WHY UNASSIGNED IS NOT SECRET. On staging: 28 live apps, and exactly TWO with
// anybody staffed on them. Closing an app nobody is on would shut 26 of 28
// systems to everyone but an admin on the day this shipped — and a rule that
// locks almost everything gets switched off rather than filled in. So an app with
// nobody on it stays open, and the fence closes around it the moment somebody is
// put on it: the more of the rota is filled in, the tighter it gets.
//
// A CLIENT LOGIN IS NOT SUBJECT TO IT. The account fence has already decided which
// apps they may see, and every one is their own system; staffing is OUR rota, and
// applying it to them would close a client's own app because none of our people
// had been assigned yet.
//
// THIS FILE EXISTS BECAUSE THE REDACTION HAD NO TEST. It was a projection inside a
// `.map()` — exactly the shape a refactor drops in silence.
