// THE LEAK TESTS — "leak tests are law" (SCOPE ch.06, "Access and the fence").
//
// A permission matrix answers "may this ROLE do this?". It cannot answer "may
// this person do it to THAT customer's rows?" — and that second question is the
// one a client portal lives or dies by. So this suite hires a burglar: a caller
// with EVERY right on the spine, pinned to one account, who walks down the
// worker's own route table and tries every handle for another account's rows.
//
// Three things make it hold up over time rather than rot into decoration:
//
//   1. THE ROUTE TABLE IS READ, NOT RETYPED. The account-scoped routes are
//      derived from the worker's ROUTES map plus the module each handler gates
//      on, read off disk. A route added tomorrow is in the derived set the
//      moment it ships.
//   2. COVERAGE FAILS THE BUILD. A derived route with no burglar attacking it,
//      or an account-scoped MODULE nobody tries the handle of, is a red build —
//      not a quiet gap. That is the difference between a test suite and a claim.
//   3. THE POSITIVE CONTROL. Every attack is paired with the same door answering
//      a STAFF caller, who must see exactly what the burglar could not. A fence
//      that refuses everybody is not a fence, it is a broken door — and it would
//      pass a refusal-only suite perfectly.
//
// The single assertion every attack reduces to: the burglar's response must not
// contain ANY id from the victim's world, and the victim's rows must be byte-for
// -byte what they were. Not "a 403" — a 200 with the name in it leaks just as
// hard as a successful write.
