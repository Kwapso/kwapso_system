// THE ACCOUNT FENCE'S CONFIRM RULE — a machine-surface write that changes WHO
// CAN SEE WHOSE must stop for the agent's yes/no panel, exactly as a write that
// changes who can do what already does.
//
// WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS, precisely. The confirm set used to be derived from a
// list of three MODULE names (member_roles, team_members, portal_users). That
// derivation is honest about permissions and blind to the fence: `link_contact`
// is gated accounts:create and `set_account_parent` is gated accounts:update, so
// neither looked like a privilege write — while both change an input the fence
// reads, and either one silently widens what an outside company's login can
// read. A green test that asserts the wrong intent is how the first confirm gap
// hid; this one asserts the intent from the DOORS' OWN SOURCE rather than from
// anybody's list.
//
// The scan, in one line: the fence declares its inputs (FENCE_INPUTS, beside the
// SQL that reads them) → a tenancy door announces what it changed by PUBLISHING
// that table (R1 guarantees every mutation publishes) → so a door whose publish
// names a fence input is a fence write → and any catalogued tool posting to it
// must confirm BOTH WAYS. Add a door tomorrow that writes account_links and a
// tool that reaches it, and this goes red until the tool confirms — even if the
// runtime derivation's name-matching missed it.
//
// "MUST CONFIRM" USED TO MEAN "must declare the literal `true`", and on 29 Aug
// 2026 that stopped being expressible for two of these doors: twenty-one
// (de)activate tools collapsed into one `set_record_active` over RECORD_TOGGLES,
// so the tool on the contact-link and portal-login doors declares a PREDICATE —
// it has to, because the same tool also archives an account, which does not ask
// both ways. Reading a declared boolean is no longer the question.
//
// So the check RUNS the rule instead, through `requiresConfirm`, in both
// directions. That is strictly stronger than what it replaced: a literal `true`
// was a promise about the declaration, and this is the answer the agent will
// actually get at the moment somebody unlinks a company — the same move R22 made
// when it stopped reading `buildBody` and started running it.
