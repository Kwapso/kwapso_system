// The token → session BRIDGE. A verified token is exchanged (via auth's
// INTERNAL_KEY-gated /internal/mcp-session) for a short-lived session PINNED to
// the token's team — so every tool call flows through the SAME gated doors a
// browser uses: live membership + role re-checked per request, input validated
// at the boundary, activity + audit written identically. Minted cookies are
// cached per isolate (~10 min) to avoid a session INSERT per call; the token
// itself is re-verified on EVERY request, so revocation bites immediately.

/** The cookie name, IMPORTED now rather than restated.
 *
 * It used to be written out here, with the true reason that one worker does not
 * reach into another's source. What was missing was a third option: the name now
 * lives in `shared/workers/session-cookie.ts`, which both workers may import
 * without either reaching into the other. Three hand-written copies of a
 * security-relevant literal — one of them on the legacy migration's thirty-day
 * clock — is a drift nothing was comparing.
 *
 * The `__Host-` prefix is auth's session-fixation defence and belongs to the
 * BROWSER contract, not this one: prefix rules constrain what a browser accepts
 * in `Set-Cookie`, while this is a request header minted worker-to-worker. It
 * matches anyway, because the name has to be the one auth reads — and auth reads
 * the prefixed name first. */

/** HOW LONG A PASSED STAFF CHECK MAY STAND.
 *
 * The cookie cache exists to avoid a session INSERT per tool call, and nothing
 * is cached until `requireStaff` has passed — so the window is also how long a
 * PASSED AUTHORIZATION DECISION stands without being re-asked. That is a posture
 * worth being precise about, even though the decision it caches has no
 * transition that could invalidate it:
 *
 *   • to hold a working token you must be an ACTIVE member of the pinned team
 *     (auth's /internal/mcp-session refuses anyone else, on every mint);
 *   • to read as a CLIENT you must have a `portal_users` row — and portal-ness
 *     is decided by the PRESENCE of that row, live or revoked (the fence reads
 *     `WHERE user_id = ?` with no liveness filter). Presence is permanent:
 *     revoking a grant keeps the row, so anyone who has EVER been a client
 *     reads as `portal` and `requireStaff` refuses them — which means they
 *     could never have minted a token in the first place. (The grant door's
 *     `is_staff` refusal still guards the FIRST grant against fencing a
 *     colleague out; since re-grants were allowed for prior clients it is a
 *     courtesy, not the carrier — presence is the carrier.)
 *
 * The two are mutually exclusive at every instant, so "staff at mint, client a
 * moment later" is not a state this app can reach. That refutation is not a
 * paragraph to be taken on trust: `test/staff-only.test.ts` reads the fence's
 * own source and fails if the presence rule ever relaxes, at which point this
 * cache has to go rather than quietly become the hole.
 *
 * It was ten minutes, on the reasoning that anything inside the 60-minute
 * pinned-session TTL is safe. "Safe" was the wrong measure — the right one is
 * how long a decision may stand unasked, and a minute is what the cache is
 * actually FOR (a burst of tool calls in one conversation shares one session).
 * Ten minutes bought a rounding error of extra sharing and held an answer for
 * ten times as long. */

/** WHAT AN EXPIRED ENTRY IS: a live session cookie for somebody the cache has
 * stopped answering for. Nothing used to remove one. `dropCachedSession` clears
 * a REVOKED token's entry and a fresh mint OVERWRITES its own, so an entry only
 * ever left this map if its own token came back — which means an isolate serving
 * many tokens accumulated one credential per token it had ever seen, past the
 * minute it was useful, for as long as the isolate lived. Small, but it is an
 * unbounded structure holding credentials, and both halves of that sentence are
 * the kind this codebase does not leave standing.
 *
 * Swept on the way past rather than on a timer: this function is the only thing
 * that writes to the map, so it is the only moment the map can grow, and a
