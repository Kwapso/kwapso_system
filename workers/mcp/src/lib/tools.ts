// agent_chat/agent_confirm bridge.
// catalog.test.ts machine-checks every forwarded path against the target workers' OWN
// route tables, and filter-parity.test.ts checks the other direction — every door that

  // R24's OUTBOUND HALF, ON THE SURFACE THAT HAS NO CONTEXT TO TAINT.
  //
  // `shared/workers/money-taint.ts` refuses a client-readable WRITE from a turn
  // that has already read a figure the client's own screen may withhold. That
  // works on the agent because a turn can be ASKED what it has run — the check
  // reads the same messages the model is reading. An MCP `tools/call` is one HTTP
  // request carrying a bearer token: no turn, no conversation, no prior tool
  // list. So the agent's predicate ported here verbatim is ALWAYS false, and
  // would be a check that passes with the hole fully open — the exact failure
  // this codebase keeps re-earning, which is why it is written down here rather
  // than discovered a third time.
  //
  // THE CHAIN IS REAL ON THIS SURFACE. An outside model reads a client's ticket
  // prose through `list_help_tickets`, and that prose can carry an instruction:
  // read what the app gives back, then reply to the ticket with the figure. Both
  // tools are here, the reply door is on the portal's own allow-list, and nothing
  // in between could see the connection.
  //
  // SO THE NUMBER DOES NOT LEAVE BY THIS DOOR AT ALL — R24's own doctrine, "a
  // condition can be inverted and a permission can be granted, an import cannot
  // be forgotten", applied to a surface whose context we cannot see. The
  // precedent is this file's own: twenty-one Google tools are already refused a
  // personal access token because "the blast radius of a leaked one must not
  // include a mailbox" (MCP.md §3). It must not include a price a particular
  // client's own screen withholds either — and the mitigation is the same one
  // Google gets: `agent_chat`, under the caller's own rights, where the per-turn
  // taint applies because there is genuinely a turn.
  //
  // WHY THE REFUSAL IS HERE AND NOT A FILTER ON `MCP_TOOLS`. It was a filter
  // first. Two things stopped it, both discovered by running it rather than by
  // reasoning: the twenty-one `set_*_active` names are PUBLISHED EXTERNAL
  // CONTRACTS that record-toggles.test.ts forbids removing, and dropping eight
  // names also inverted R43's direction of travel (an mcp-only asymmetry is the
  // harmless one; an agent-only gap is not) and staled two hard-coded census
  // counts and MCP.md. That
  // is a product decision about a published API, not a security fix, so it went
  // back to the planner instead. This refusal closes the hole identically — the
  // figure never leaves the building through MCP either way — and breaks nothing.
  //
  // ASKED OF `dest`, NOT OF THE TOOL NAME: a name is a label somebody chooses, a
  // path is the door itself, and `dest` is the door this call will actually open
  // — `route(input)` for a tool that resolves per call from its own input (which
  // is how `set_record_active` could otherwise be POINTED at a money door),
  // `tool.path` for everything else. `readsInternalMoney` is the same derived
  // predicate the agent's taint uses and the same one `money-taint-outbound`
  // rot-checks against tenancy's own ROUTES, so a new money door is one line in
  // money-taint.ts and this follows it with nothing edited here.
