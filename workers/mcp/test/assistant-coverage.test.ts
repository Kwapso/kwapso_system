// R47 — EVERY MODULE A PERSON CAN SEE, THE ASSISTANT CAN ANSWER ABOUT; AND WHAT
// IS NOT IN THE CORPUS SAYS WHY.
//
// The owner's sentence, 1 Sep 2026: anything he can see in the app, the
// knowledge base should be able to see. He proved it false the way he proves
// everything — he asked it something. "What is Alex's full name?" was
// unanswerable, and NOT because retrieval failed: nothing anywhere in the base
// said who his own colleagues are. `staff_profiles` carries a `user_id` and no
// name column at all, and the names live in the GLOBAL core database, so no
// table the sweep could reach had ever held the answer.
//
// TWO CLAUSES, BECAUSE ONE WAS MEASURED AND FOUND TOOTHLESS. The first draft of
// this law asked only "is this module reachable by the assistant at all", and
// the census came back 21 of 22 green — every module already had a list tool.
// That is exactly why the failure was invisible: a tool answers when the model
// knows to call it, and a person asking a vague question reaches the CORPUS. So
// the law separates the two, and makes a corpus gap a written decision instead
// of an accident.
//
// THE MONEY IS THE CASE THAT SETTLES THE SHAPE. Internal rates and the margin
// are reachable by tool, on the doors R24 already fences — and they must NEVER
// be in the corpus, because the corpus has exactly one gate (`knowledge:read`)
// and no way to subtract a caller's denied modules the way the activity feed
// does (R18). A law that only asked "is it reachable" would have passed that in
// silence. A law that demanded a kind per module would have demanded the breach.
// Written down, it is the true sentence, and it is the owner's to read:
// reachable, but only by the people who could already see it.
//
// NOTHING HAND-LISTED. The modules come from the permission matrix, the kinds
// from the sweep, the tools from the agent's own catalogue, and each tool's gate
// from the source of the door it forwards to — the same door census R19, R22 and
// R27 stand on, which is why this file sits beside them.
