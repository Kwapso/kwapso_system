// THE MACHINE SURFACE IS THE AGENCY'S. A client-portal login must not mint a
// personal access token, and a token must not act for one.
//
// The finding this locks: a client-portal contact IS an ordinary team member —
// grant → invite → accept is the only way to make a working portal login. So
// "are you signed in?" never told the two apart, and a client who signed in at
// the AGENCY address could mint a token and call the agency's own reads with
// their Client role's rights: the whole of an internal module, in full, as a
// CSV. Nothing was bypassed. The gate ran and PASSED — the reason that material
// is safe is that the client's own gateway REFUSES those doors, and the machine
// surface had no door-level opinion at all.
//
// (The module it was found on was Learning, which has since been purged. The
// finding was never about articles: it was about a door with no fence, no
// refusal, and a second front entrance nobody had asked the question at.)
//
// Driven through the worker's real handlers, with tenancy answering the way the
// real door does: `{ kind: "staff" | "portal", accounts, currentAccountId }`.
