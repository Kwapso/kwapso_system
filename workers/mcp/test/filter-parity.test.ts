// R19 — AGENT/MCP FILTER PARITY and R22 — BODY-FIELD PARITY, both standing on
// one full DOOR CENSUS.
//
// Three things are checked here, in that order, because the later two are
// worthless without the first:
//
//   1. COVERAGE — every door a person can reach on the four workers that serve
//      the app's own doors (tenancy, content, data-ops, auth) either has a tool
//      on SOME machine surface (the shared catalog, the MCP's own, or the
//      agent's own), or is a named line in TOOLLESS_DOORS with a written reason.
//   2. PARITY, the QUERY half (R19) — a tool sitting on a door that FILTERS must
//      expose and forward every filter that door parses, or the assistant falls
//      back to free text and answers a DIFFERENT question (downstream: 3,465
//      descriptions that merely mentioned the words instead of the 134 records
//      carrying the value). The required filter set is DERIVED from the door's
//      own parameter parsing — never hand-listed here.
//   3. PARITY, the BODY half (R22) — the same sentence about the other half of
//      an HTTP request. A tool on a WRITE door must expose and forward every
//      field that door reads off the body, or a named line in
//      NARROWED_BODY_FIELDS says why not. R19 alone measured query strings, so
//      four write tools quietly offered a narrower contract than their door
//      accepted for six weeks under a green build: update_team could not set the
//      logo, create_role could not carry its permission matrix,
//      reply_help_ticket could not @mention, agent_chat could not attach a file.
//      Same census, same derivation, other half of the request.
//
// THE SCAN STARTS AT THE DOORS, NOT THE TOOLS — and now at ALL of them. It once
// iterated SHARED_TOOLS, so a door with no tool was not a failure, it was
// invisible; that is how eleven capabilities across the customer spine sat
// outside the machine surface with a green R19 suite. Moving the scan to the
// doors fixed that — for doors that take a QUERY PARAMETER. Everything else was
// still invisible, and twenty capabilities were sitting in exactly that blind
// spot: what may I do here, how much of the app's own daily AI allowance is
// left, what may I import into, what did that import plan say. None of them
// takes a filter, so none of them was ever counted.
//
// A law that only inspects the doors you gave a query string measures your query
// strings. So the denominator is now every non-admin door, filtered or not:
// silence about a capability has to be written down before it is allowed.

An assistant able to call it could enlarge its own sight of somebody's mail, which is the one act that would make act-as-user stop meaning anything.

Nothing is lost. `create_deliverable` and `update_deliverable` both carry `url`, so a machine that already has an address for the material — a recording, a document, an API reference, which is what most deliverables are — files the record in full.

What it needs is not argument room but a browser: a signed PUT is issued to a client that will make an HTTP request to R2 with the exact Content-Type and Content-Length the signature pins, and a model emitting a tool call is not that client. A machine caller that genuinely holds bytes already has a door — the buffered and streamed uploads below — and the one thing it cannot do is hold a PDF, which it never could.

The buffered door is unreachable because 34 million characters will not fit in an argument; this one is unreachable because it does not take arguments for the part that matters.

Changing the cost model is the owner's decision, not a parity default.
