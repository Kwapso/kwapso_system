// TWENTY-ONE TOOLS BECAME ONE. THIS IS THE PROOF IT WAS A REFACTOR.
//
// On 29 Aug 2026 the agent's `set_account_active`, `set_role_active`,
// `set_app_active` … `set_staff_certificate_active` collapsed into a single
// `set_record_active` over `RECORD_TOGGLES`. The saving is real — about 2,500
// tokens of schema, re-sent on every model step of every turn — and so is the
// risk, because a collapse is the one refactor that can quietly change
// behaviour in twenty-one places at once while the build stays green.
//
// Four things are pinned here, and each is a different way the collapse could
// have gone wrong without anybody noticing:
//
//   1. EVERY DOOR IS STILL REACHABLE, proved by RUNNING `route` rather than by
//      reading the list beside it. The same standard R22 holds `buildBody` to,
//      and for the same reason: a list is a claim, a run is an observation.
//   2. EVERY DOOR STILL RECEIVES THE BODY IT READS — the right id field under
//      the right name, `roleId` where the roles door says `roleId`.
//   3. THE CONFIRM MATRIX IS UNCHANGED, both directions, all twenty-one,
//      against a table captured from the twenty-one tools BEFORE they were
//      deleted. This is the assertion the whole file exists for.
//   4. THE MCP SURFACE KEPT ITS NAMES. A tool name there is an external
//      contract; `set_${record}_active` reproduces every historical one exactly
//      — `set_dropdown_value_active` included, which is why the record is called
//      `dropdown_value` and not `dropdown`.
