// R43 — AGENT/MCP TOOL-SET PARITY: a tool that exists on one machine surface
// exists on the other too, or the gap is a named, reasoned line — never silence.
//
// R19/R22's coverage census (filter-parity.test.ts) asks whether a DOOR has a
// tool on SOME machine surface — the agent's own catalog, MCP's own, or the
// shared one both project from. That "some" is deliberate for R19/R22's own
// purpose (a door reachable from either surface is not a gap the OWNER asked
// about), but it has a blind spot of its own: a door with an AGENT tool and no
// MCP tool passes that census trivially, and the asymmetry between the two
// machine surfaces — which is exactly the sentence the owner asked to be made
// checkable ("same thing an agent can do, same thing from MCP") — is never
// itself examined. Twenty-five tools lived on the agent and nowhere on MCP;
// twenty-three lived on MCP and nowhere on the agent. Every one of them turned
// out to be a real, written decision (MCP.md §3's "intentionally NOT on the
// machine surface" list, and the mirror sentence in
// workers/mcp/src/lib/tools.ts's own MCP_ONLY comment) — but nothing before
// this file MACHINE-CHECKED that the decision was written down, or that it was
// still true. The comment introducing data-ops's own AGENT_ONLY array undercounts
// itself today: it names four tools and was never updated when the 21 Google
// tools joined it, which is the drift this test exists to catch happening again.
//
// EARNED A SECOND TIME, on this law's own first real merge (29 Aug 2026). Two
// branches, each green alone, collapsed onto an integration branch and R43 was
// the only thing that caught what neither could see by itself: the agent's 21
// `set_*_active` toggles collapsed into one `set_record_active` (a genuine,
// reasoned cost saving — the agent re-sends its whole catalogue every model
// step), and 9 `list_*` tools stopped being sent to the agent in favour of the
// new `query_records` grammar — but MCP, which pays nothing per step and treats
// a tool name as an external contract, kept publishing all 30 by name. The
// owner's ruling: correct and deliberate, wire the one piece that was a genuine
// gap (`set_record_active` had NO form on MCP at all — not even the generic
// shape), and reason the rest. **THE DIRECTION THAT MATTERS: MCP is a STRICT
// SUPERSET of the agent's catalog, never a subset.** Every one of these 30
// names is MCP holding something the agent no longer carries by that name —
// nothing a person can do through the UI became unreachable from MCP, which is
// the owner's actual sentence. An agent-only column reappearing here would be
// the dangerous direction; an mcp-only one growing is the safe one, and this
// file's own coverage test (below) still fails loudly the day that stops being
// true for any UNDOCUMENTED name.
//
// Nothing here is hand-listed beyond the two reason tables: tool names come
// from TOOL_CATALOG and MCP_TOOLS themselves, exactly as filter-parity.test.ts
// reads doors off the route tables rather than prose.
