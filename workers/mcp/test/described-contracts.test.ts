// R27 — DESCRIBED CONTRACTS: every `backticked` identifier in a tool
// description names something real.
//
// R19/R22 prove the machine-readable contract — schema, buildQuery, buildBody —
// against the door's own source. Neither ever reads the PROSE, and the prose is
// the half a developer and a model actually read. Proven on 2026-08-16: a
// session reverted a tool description to a false promise, added two parameters
// that do not exist and a fake filter claim, and `npm run check` passed —
// because every law on this surface reads the wiring and none read the words.
//
// So the words get the same treatment the wiring gets: DERIVED, never trusted.
// A backticked identifier in a description must be one of:
//
//   1. an argument the tool's own schema declares;
//   2. a query param its door parses (`searchParams.get`, the R19 census);
//   3. a body field its door reads (`body.<f>`, the R22 census);
//   4. a field its response actually carries, from the seams and the door's own
//      source — the pagedJson contract (R14's one paged shape) plus the door's
//      extras read out of the call itself; the keys of `json({...})` literals in
//      the handler; the row fields the module's own libs map off a database row
//      (`stepKey: r.step_key` — the one shape every mapper here uses); and the
//      keys of R23's `knowledgeAnswer` seam, for the module whose routes import
//      it (no door may assemble that response by hand, so the seam IS the
//      contract);
//   5. another tool's name on either machine surface (descriptions cross-refer:
//      "pass `cursor` from `list_help_tickets`");
//   6. an entry in DESCRIPTION_VOCABULARY below — the small reviewed remainder,
//      each with a reason, rot-checked like every other deny-list in the base.
//
// Nothing hand-listed that can be derived: tools from the three catalogues
// themselves, doors from each worker's own switchboard, reads from handler
// source, response keys from the seams and the module's own libs.
//
// SCOPE, stated honestly: this law checks IDENTIFIERS, not sentences. A
// description that misuses a REAL identifier ("filters by `status`" on a door
// whose rows merely carry status) tells a lie no identifier census can see —
// that sentence is R19/R22's to make pointless, since the schema either exposes
// the filter or doesn't. What THIS law ends is the lie that actually shipped:
// a name that exists nowhere — not in the schema, not in the door, not in the
// response — surviving review because only humans read prose, and humans
// assume a green build checked it.

Delete this line when the derivation learns to read MODULE_ALIASES, or when the module names stop diverging. Earned on 29 Aug 2026: the assistant asked for `help`, the door refused, and the owner's own question died on its first call — so the description now teaches the alias, which is exactly the kind of true sentence this list exists to allow.",

Underivable for the same reason `runaway` is, plus one: it is NESTED a level inside a response field, and the response-key derivation reads the keys a door hands over rather than the shape of the objects inside them. Delete this line when that census learns to walk one level down, or when `byAccount` goes.",
  runaway:
    "the flag on a running timer that has been going longer than RUNAWAY_HOURS — computed at read time in workers/content/src/lib/work-logs.ts (`runaway: elapsed > …`), so it is a real row field the row-mapper derivation cannot see: no column is copied, the value is arithmetic over one.",
  // `awaiting_validation` had a line here — "the stage a ticket OPENS in when
  // its kind is one that waits for the client (CHECKLIST 5.13)". The client
  // retired that stage on 7 Sep 2026 and no description names it any more, so
  // the rotting-entry rule below took the line out: an entry nothing uses is a

  // now the ONLY stage a ticket opens in, which is what its line says.
  new: "the one stage `createTicket` opens a ticket in — a HELP_STATUSES value in shared/types.ts, not a field: `createTicket` computes it and no door reads it off a body, so neither the schema census nor the response-key derivation can see it. It had a sibling here (`awaiting_validation`, for the kinds that waited on the client) until that stage was retired on 7 Sep 2026, and the birth status stopped being a decision at all.",

  // derivation improved. That is the exemption list working the way it should.

Counted in the one statement rather than per row on purpose — a query per department is the N+1 this module would otherwise have been born with.",

    "the departments a role sits in — several, deliberately (the owner: \"one role is doing things across multiple departments, especially in slightly smaller companies\"). It is a real field on every row list_client_roles returns AND a real body field update_client_role sends, and it is derivable from neither side: the value is stitched in memory from a second statement over `client_role_departments`, not copied off a column.",
  peopleIds:
    "the contacts holding a role, stitched from `client_role_people` in the same read as the departments above and for the same reason — one statement for the whole page rather than one per role. There is deliberately no person table behind it: a person on a role is a contact we already have, because a second address book is one that goes out of step with the first.",
  export_too_large:
    "the refusal code a too-big export answers with, thrown by the one CSV seam (shared/workers/csv.ts) — R14's posture applied to files: the export is whole or it is an error, never a silently short CSV. An error VALUE rather than a response key, so no door's own source names it.",
  memberUserId:
    "who on a meeting's invitation is one of OUR OWN people. It is a real field on every `links` row `get_meeting_people` returns, and it is derivable from nothing this census can read: `linkGuests` (workers/content/src/lib/meetings.ts) builds it from a users row in the GLOBAL core database, over `env.DB.prepare` rather than the team's REST door, so the row-mapper derivation — which reads a module's libs mapping off a team-database row — never sees the statement at all. The shape it belongs to is `MeetingPersonLink` in shared/types.ts.",
  memberName:
    "the name beside `memberUserId`, and underivable for exactly the same reason — it is assembled in code from the core database's `first_name` and `last_name`, so there is no column being copied for the derivation to find. Named beside its sibling because a description that promised the id and not the name would describe half a row.",
