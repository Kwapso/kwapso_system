// THE RETRIEVAL BENCH — what the knowledge base actually answers, measured
// against the agency's own material rather than against books.
//
// ── IT MEASURES A BRANCH, WITHOUT DEPLOYING ANYTHING ────────────────────────
//
// That is the whole property, and it is the reason a retrieval change can be
// judged at all. A bench that asked the deployed door would measure whatever is
// deployed — so a change sitting on a branch could not be measured before it
// shipped, and "ship it and see" is a hope, not a gate. Three things make the
// other way possible, and the third is the one nobody guesses:
//
//   • `retrieve` is IMPORTED FROM THE WORKING TREE. The code under test is the
//     file you just edited, not a copy of it and not a deployment of it.
//   • env.KNOWLEDGE_INDEX and env.AI are one small object each — Vectorize and
//     bge-m3 over their REST doors, same index, same namespace, same filter,
//     same model. A Worker gives a binding; Node gives a `fetch`. Nothing else
//     differs, and the fence is exercised rather than asserted.
//   • D1 NEEDS NO STAND-IN AT ALL. `d1Query` already speaks to Cloudflare's REST
//     door, so pointing `cfg` at the real team database means the WORDS come out
//     of the real database under the real reader clause (R26), exactly as they
//     do in production.
//
// So: real code, real index, real embeddings, real rows, real fences — and no
// deploy. Run it on `main`, run it on your branch, read the difference.
//
// ── HOW TO RUN IT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   node --experimental-transform-types scripts/kb-bench.mjs
//   node --experimental-transform-types scripts/kb-bench.mjs --verbose
//
// `--experimental-transform-types`, NOT `--experimental-strip-types`: the strip
// mode cannot compile the constructor parameter properties in
// shared/workers/gating.ts and dies before the first question. `@shared/*` is
// resolved by scripts/lib/shared-alias.mjs, imported on the first line below.
//
// KB_INDEX / KB_CORE / KB_TEAM point it at another environment; it is read-only
// in every one of them.
//
// ── WHAT IT COSTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One embedding call per question (a few thousand tokens, on Workers AI) and one
// Vectorize query each. It never asks for `compose`, so it spends nothing from
// the team's own AI allowance — composing is the only act on this module that
// draws it. The token comes from the Keychain, like every other script here.
// Nothing is written: every statement this runs is a SELECT.
