//
// WHAT THIS FIXES. `seed-staging.mjs` brought twenty-eight apps, twenty companies
// and a hundred and three people across, and not one picture with them: `apps`
// had no column to put a logo in until 0037, and the accounts columns existed
// (0024) but the seed never sent them. So the app screen drew the same stage
// glyph on every tile while the app it replaced showed the client's real mark.
// This is the second half of that migration, run separately because it moves
// BYTES and the seed moves rows.
//
// THE BYTES COME TO US, NOT A LINK TO THEM. Every picture in the export is a
// `storage.googleapis.com/glide-prod…` URL, and those stop resolving the day the
// Glide subscription ends (RECONCILIATION.md §4.5). Storing the URL would put
// every logo in this app on somebody else's infrastructure, on a clock. So each
// file is read off disk (scripts/glide-files.mjs already rescued them), turned
// into a data URL, and POSTed to the ordinary gated door — which puts it in OUR
// R2 under the team's own prefix and keeps a `/media/...` path on the row. The
// upload seam is `shared/workers/image.ts storeImageDataUrl`; this script does
// not know where R2 is and must not.
//
// IT WRITES THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR, exactly as the seed does and for the same
// three reasons: it proves the doors work, it goes through the permission spine,
// and it leaves real activity rows and live pings behind. Nothing here touches
// D1 and nothing here touches a bucket.
//
// SAFE TO RUN TWICE, AND CHEAP TO. Every record is matched on the same natural
// key the seed used (an app's name, a company's name, a person's email) and a
// record that already carries the picture is SKIPPED — so a second run writes
// nothing and says so. That is what makes it safe to re-run after fixing the two
// or three files that failed the first time.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT DO, said out loud rather than fudged:
//
// • THE DOOR TAKES PNG, JPEG OR WEBP UNDER 2.5 MB (parseDataUrl). Four files in
//   the export are outside that — one AVIF, and three over the cap. They are
//   re-encoded with `sips`, which is on every Mac; where `sips` is missing or
//   fails, the file is REPORTED and skipped rather than quietly dropped.
// • A URL THAT IS NOT GLIDE'S IS LEFT ALONE. Twenty-seven contact photos and one
//   app logo point at a client's own website or a stock library. Those are not
//   ours to re-host: they are somebody else's asset on somebody else's terms,
//   they were never in Glide's bucket, and they do not die with the Glide
//   account. They are counted and named, and the owner can decide.
