// WHAT THIS FIXES, and it is two things with one cause.
//
// `scripts/glide-files.mjs` rescued 194 files off Glide's storage.
// `scripts/glide-visuals.mjs` carried the app logos, the company logos and
// covers and the contact photos. Eight files were left, because they are not
// pictures: six PDFs and two videos. Nothing in the repo looked at them.
//
// THE SIX PDFs ARE BRAND ASSETS, and the reason they were missed is worth
// writing down because it is the same mistake twice. Glide's `branding` table
// has TWO file columns: `am2b4` (the picture on the card) and `iXERi` (the
// document itself). `seed-the-quiet-screens.mjs` reads `am2b4` and skips a row
// with nothing in it — "8 skipped, no file on the row". Six of those eight rows
// DO have a file. It is in the other column. So the six most substantial things
// in the agency's brand library — the Brand Book, the Branding presentation, the
// Moodboard, the Social templates, the Spacing and font sizes deck and the Glide
// certificate — are not in this app at all, and the log said the rows were empty.
//
// THE PICTURES THAT DID COME ACROSS ARE BORROWED. That same seed wrote Glide's
// URL straight into `file_url`, with a description that says so out loud: "the
// file is still hosted there, not by us". Forty-one live brand assets are one
// cancelled subscription away from being forty-one broken images
// (RECONCILIATION.md §4.5). The bytes are already on this machine. This moves
// them.
//
// THE BYTES COME TO US, NEVER A LINK TO THEM. Same rule and same seam as
// glide-visuals.mjs: read the file off disk, POST it to the ordinary gated
// upload door (`/api/content/brand-assets/upload-stream`, gated
// `brand_assets:create`), and patch the row through the ordinary edit door
// (gated `brand_assets:edit`, which publishes and writes activity). Nothing here
// touches D1 and nothing here touches a bucket.
//
// THE TWO VIDEOS HAVE NO RECORD TO LAND ON, and that is a decision rather than a
// gap — see the last section, which prints it every run rather than leaving it
// in a comment nobody opens.
//
// SAFE TO RE-RUN. A record is matched by name, and a file is skipped when the
// row already points at a `/media/internal/…` path of ours. A second run writes
// nothing and says so.
//
// AND IT FAILS LOUDLY. Every refusal, every unreadable file and every write that
// does not survive the read-back is counted, printed, and turned into a non-zero
// exit — including the quiet one: signing in as somebody whose team has no brand
// library at all, which is what an unnoticed wrong `SEED_OWNER_EMAIL` looks like
// from in here. "Nothing to do" is never allowed to be the same as "done".
