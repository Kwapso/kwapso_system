// MCP smoke test — the EXTERNAL MACHINE SURFACE, proven against live staging.
//
// smoke-staging.mjs walks the human journey and touches /mcp in passing. This
// one is the machine door's own suite: it mints a personal access token and
// then connects over the gateway at POST /mcp with `Authorization: Bearer …`,
// exactly as an outside tool would — no service bindings, no internal keys, no
// shortcuts the real client wouldn't have.
//
// It does not TRUST the posture in MCP.md §5 — it tries to break each claim:
//
//   · acts AS its owner, never above them — a denied tool is refused, and being
//     granted READ never smuggles in CREATE;
//   · pinned to ONE team — the token keeps reading its own team while the human
//     it belongs to is signed into a DIFFERENT team where they are Admin;
//   · a role change bites the LIVE token — both directions, no re-mint, on the
//     very next call (the bridged session cookie is cached, so this proves the
//     DOOR re-checks the role, not just the bridge);
//   · a revoked token is dead on the next call;
//   · R19 filter parity — every filter a list door parses is exposed by the
//     DEPLOYED catalogue and actually filters (a dropped filter would silently
//     answer a different question).
//
// Two fixed accounts, so repeat runs don't litter: the ADMIN (the same account
// smoke-staging uses, owner of the token's team) and the MACHINE OWNER — a
// deliberately under-privileged member who holds the token. The machine owner
// also keeps their OWN personal team, which is what makes the one-team proof
// real rather than notional.
//
