// — filled so the app reads like a working system.
//
//   TEST_LOGIN_KEY=… node scripts/seed-the-quiet-screens.mjs staging
//
// WHERE EACH ONE'S CONTENT COMES FROM, because they are not the same and the
// difference matters:
//
//   • THE BRAND LIBRARY IS REAL — Glide's `branding` table, read straight out of
//     the rows this repo pulled, and still pointing at the files Glide hosts.
//
//   • PROCESS MAPS ARE NOT REAL, and this file says so out loud in the place a
//     reader will see it. Glide never held a process map, so there is nothing to
//     import: the maps below are written FROM the apps' own descriptions — which
//     say, in the client's own words, what each system replaced ("Excel
//     spreadsheets", "WhatsApp groups", "Post-its and Outlook flags", "paper") —
//     and the TIMES are first-pass estimates, not measurements.
//
//     That matters more here than anywhere else in the app: a process map's
//     times drive the savings figure, and the savings figure is shown to the
//     CLIENT on their own portal whether or not price visibility is on. So every
//     map carries a line in its description saying the times are unconfirmed and
//     must be agreed with the client before anybody quotes them. The app's own
//     caption already says the times are agreed estimates; this is the sentence
//     that keeps that true while they are not yet agreed.
//
// TWO SCREENS THIS SCRIPT USED TO FILL AND DELIBERATELY NO LONGER DOES.
// Marketing was purged outright on 17 Aug 2026, so there is no screen left to
// fill. The delivery method went the same day, and that one is a fold rather
// than a loss: its ten programmes were always the SPRINT TYPE under a second
// name, so the enrichment that made them worth a table of their own — the mark,
// the German name, the description, the standard length in days — now lives on
// the sprint type's own row, seeded from SPRINT_TYPE_CATALOGUE and back-filled
// by migration 0025_purge_learning_marketing_programmes. A fresh team already
// has those rows before this script signs in; writing them again would be a
// second hand on the same dial.
//
// STAGING ONLY by default, and production refuses the sign-in door anyway.
