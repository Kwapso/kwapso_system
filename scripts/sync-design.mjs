/**
 * sync-design.mjs — pull the kwapso design system into shared/ui/ at a tag.
 *
 * The kit at github.com/Kwapso/kwapso-ui-ux is a DEPENDENCY, vendored rather than
 * installed, so that `npm ci` and the Cloudflare build never need private-repo
 * credentials. This script is the only door new kit code enters through:
 *
 *     node scripts/sync-design.mjs v0.9.0
 *
 * It clones the repo at that tag (default: the tag pinned in
 * shared/ui/VERSION.json), replaces shared/ui/ with the kit's deliverable
 * directories, and writes VERSION.json with the tag, the commit sha, and a
 * content hash. `npm run check` recomputes that hash (web/test/vendored-kit
 * .test.ts) and goes red if anything under shared/ui/ was hand-edited since —
 * a local edit to the kit must be made upstream instead, or the fork drifts.
 *
 * shared/ui/ is also excluded from this repo's oxlint (.oxlintrc.json), for
 * the same reason node_modules is: it is a DEPENDENCY. Its own repo lints it;
 * linting a vendored copy we may not edit would only produce unactionable red.
 *
 * CLONING USES THE PLAIN REPOSITORY URL, and that is a fix rather than a
 * simplification. This carried `https://alaap-kwapso@github.com/…` on the
 * reasoning that the kit needs a different GitHub identity from the machine's
 * default. A username in the URL does not SELECT a credential — it forces git
 * to look one up for that exact user, and when the helper has nothing filed
 * under it git falls through to an interactive password prompt. There is no
 * terminal on this path, so the prompt failed as `could not read Password …
 * Device not configured` and the vendor step died at `git clone`, on 7 Sep
 * 2026, with the tag sitting correctly on the remote. The plain URL lets the
 * configured helper answer, which it does — the same URL the kit's own
 * checkout pushes through.

     restructured to the four words the client uses: `controls/` and
     `structures/` became one `components/`, and `tokens/`, `icons/` and
     `motion/` moved under `foundations/`. Nothing was renamed inside those
     folders — 1,431 of 1,507 moved paths are byte-identical and not one
     basename changed — so this is a pure folder move and the app's imports
     follow it mechanically.

     `lib/` stayed at top level and is byte-identical between versions, which
     is why the app's `@shared/ui/lib/*` imports need no change at all.

     `docs/` arrives too, since 2026-08-27: five rulebooks, about 156 KB, that
     had never once reached this repository because they were not on this list.
