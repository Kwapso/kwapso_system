// R2 LIFECYCLE RULES — the one thing in this system that had no expiry at all.
//
// ── WHAT WAS MISSING ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every other store here has a lifetime somebody decided. Sessions expire; the
// error log has a retention sweep and an hourly write ceiling; `db_growth` keeps
// two readings per database rather than one a night; D1 has a size alarm, a
// growth rate and (since 5 Sep 2026) an account-level ceiling. R2 had none of
// that: no lifecycle rule on any bucket, in any environment, since the day the
// first one was created. An object written in June 2026 is still being paid for,
// and — because `scripts/backup.mjs` uses the bucket as its own inventory, by
// design and for good reasons — it is also copied on every nightly backup run.
//
// ── WHY EXPIRY-BY-AGE IS NOT THE RULE, AND WILL NOT BE ──────────────────────
//
// The obvious lifecycle rule is "delete objects older than N days", and it is
// the wrong one here and always will be: a team logo uploaded two years ago is
// live, and an object's age says nothing whatever about whether a row still
// points at it. Deleting by age would take a client's brand mark off their
// record. Garbage in this bucket is identified by REFERENCE, not by date, which
// is `reclaimMedia`'s job at the door that supersedes it (shared/workers/image.ts).
//
// So this sets the two rules that are safe BY CONSTRUCTION — neither can ever
// remove a byte anything points at:
//
//   1. ABORT INCOMPLETE MULTIPART UPLOADS after 7 days. A part uploaded for a
//      multipart that was never completed is unreachable by any key: no row can
//      reference it, no door can serve it, and it is billed as storage until
//      somebody aborts it. R2's own recommended baseline rule.
//   2. (OPT-IN) TRANSITION TO INFREQUENT ACCESS after 90 days. Same bytes, same
//      keys, same URLs — a cheaper storage class with a retrieval fee. It is a
//      COST decision rather than a correctness one, so it is off unless
//      `--infrequent` is passed, and OPERATIONS.md carries the arithmetic.
//
// ── HOW THE BUCKET LIST IS DECIDED ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Read off the wrangler configs, exactly as `scripts/backup.mjs` does it, plus
// the one bucket no worker binds (the Glide archive). A bucket is covered
// because a worker declares it, so adding a binding adds it here and there is no
// second list to keep in step — and `workers/gateway/test/r2-lifecycle.test.ts`
// re-derives both halves off disk so the two can never drift.
//
// Usage (every Cloudflare command on this machine takes the cf-exec prefix — a
// bare wrangler resolves to the wrong company's account):
//
//   cf-exec node scripts/r2-lifecycle.mjs staging
//   cf-exec node scripts/r2-lifecycle.mjs production --infrequent
//   cf-exec node scripts/r2-lifecycle.mjs staging --dry-run
//
// It is idempotent: `r2 bucket lifecycle set` replaces the rule set, so running
// it twice leaves the same rules. Nothing here reads or writes an object.
//
// ── IT HAS NEVER BEEN RUN. Checked 2026-09-06, against the live account ──────
//
// All nine kwapso buckets carry exactly one lifecycle rule and it is not ours:
//
//     cf-exec npx wrangler r2 bucket lifecycle list kwapso-media
//     name: Default Multipart Abort Rule
//
// That is Cloudflare's own rule, applied when a bucket is created. The rule THIS
// script writes has id `abort-incomplete-multipart`, and it appears on no bucket
// in either environment. So the script exists, is correct, is tested, and is not
// a control — an unrun script protects nothing, and from the disk alone the two
// are indistinguishable.
//
// What that costs today is small and worth stating rather than assuming:
// Cloudflare's default rule happens to do the same job as rule 1, so incomplete
// multiparts ARE being aborted. What is missing is rule 2 (infrequent access),
// which is opt-in and off, and the guarantee that rule 1 stays there if the
// default ever changes.
//
// Running it is an infrastructure change to live buckets, so it is the owner's
// to make, not a lane's:
//
//     cf-exec node scripts/r2-lifecycle.mjs staging --dry-run   # see it first
//     cf-exec node scripts/r2-lifecycle.mjs staging
//     cf-exec node scripts/r2-lifecycle.mjs production
