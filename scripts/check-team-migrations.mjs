// THE MIGRATION GATE — refuse to deploy while a team database is behind.
//
//   node scripts/check-team-migrations.mjs staging
//   node scripts/check-team-migrations.mjs production
//
// A PIPELINE GATE, not a Law of the Base: it asks a question about the LIVE
// ESTATE, so it has no RULES.md entry, no registry row and no rule test.
//
// It runs in both deploy chains IMMEDIATELY AFTER TENANCY IS DEPLOYED and before
// any other worker. That position is the whole design and it is not negotiable;
// the section "WHERE IT SITS, AND WHY IT MOVED" below is the reason.
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS (26-27 Aug 2026) ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Migration `0057_one_control_where_there_were_two` created a new per-team table
// (`sync_leases`). The code that writes to it went to staging and production
// WITHOUT the migration being rolled out to the team databases that already
// existed. Every "Bring it in" press then reached a table that was not there and
// came back a 500.
//
// `npm run check` was green the whole time and could never have caught it. The
// test suite builds its database by replaying the WHOLE of `TEAM_MIGRATIONS` on
// every run, so the schema it tests against is always current by construction.
// Only an environment with a HISTORY — a database built months ago and migrated
// forward since — can be behind. That is not a property of the source, so no
// test that reads the source can see it.
//
// OPERATIONS.md already said "roll it out with migrate-teams first, then deploy".
// It said it in prose, and prose does not fail a build.
//
// ── WHAT IT ASKS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The core database's `teams.schema_version` is what the migration robot WRITES
// when it finishes a team (`migrateTeams`, workers/tenancy/src/routes/admin.ts),
// so it is the estate's own record of how far each team has been carried. This
// reads that column and compares it with the last entry in `TEAM_MIGRATIONS`.
//
// Both halves are DERIVED and neither is typed here:
//
//   • the LATEST version is parsed out of `workers/tenancy/src/team-schema/migrations.ts`
//     itself, off the syntax tree, not matched with a regex and never copied.
//     A copied version number in this file would be a gate that goes green
//     while the estate is behind — the exact failure it exists to catch, wearing
//     a green tick. (README/OPERATIONS both carry the scar: the sentence naming
//     the last migration has drifted twice.)
//   • WHICH TEAMS COUNT is the robot's own WHERE clause, lifted out of
//     `migrateTeams`. The gate and the robot must agree about the population or
//     the gate refuses over teams the remedy provably cannot fix.
//
// It reaches the core database only. It does NOT open the team databases, and
// that is deliberate: those go through the D1 REST door on `CF_D1_TOKEN`, which
// is the credential that was rotated on 27 Aug — a gate that needs the broken
// thing to tell you something is broken is not a gate.
//
// ── WHERE IT SITS, AND WHY IT MOVED (27 Aug 2026, hours after it shipped) ───
//
// It first shipped as the FIRST thing in both deploy chains, ahead of even
// `lang:check`, so that it would fail in a second rather than after a two-minute
// build. That position deadlocked the next schema change, which is every schema
// change from here on:
//
//   · lane/google-scope wrote migration 0058. Local TEAM_MIGRATIONS ends at
//     0058; both live teams read 0057. The gate refused. So far correct.
//   · The remedy said "run the robot". The robot answered HTTP 200,
//     {"teamsChecked":2,"teamsMigrated":0}, and changed nothing.
//   · The gate refused again, identically, forever.
//
// BECAUSE THE ROBOT IS NOT A TOOL, IT IS A DEPLOYED WORKER. `migrateTeams`
// applies `TEAM_MIGRATIONS` AS BUNDLED INTO THE RUNNING TENANCY WORKER. That
// worker was built from main and had never heard of 0058, so it correctly found
// nothing missing and correctly reported success. Teams could not reach 0058
// until a tenancy carrying 0058 was deployed; nothing could be deployed until
// teams reached 0058; and the gate stood in front of the deploy. Closed loop.
//
// The gate had been asking "is the estate current with my working tree?" at a
// moment when the answer NO has two completely different causes and only one
// remedy printed:
//
//   A. the migration is DEPLOYED and not rolled out — the 26-27 Aug incident,
//      the fault this exists for. The estate is broken right now. Refuse.
//   B. the migration is merely WRITTEN — the ordinary state of every branch that
//      adds one. Nothing is broken; the deploy IS the remedy. Refusing here is
//      the deadlock.
//
// Nothing in the core database can tell A from B: `schema_version` records how
// far the robot has carried each team and says nothing about what the deployed
// worker knows. So the fix is not a cleverer question, it is a better MOMENT to
// ask it. Deploying tenancy collapses B into A — once the running worker carries
// the new list, "behind" means one thing and the printed remedy always works.
//
// Hence: lang:check → build → realtime, auth, TENANCY → **this check** → content,
// data-ops, mcp, both gateways → smoke. The gate now guards exactly the workers
// that READ the new columns, which is precisely who broke on the 27th (content's
// sync-lease writer), and the three-phase sequence OPERATIONS.md always described
// in prose — tenancy, then migrate, then the rest — is finally the sequence the
// command actually runs. As a bonus it makes that prose POSSIBLE: taken
// literally, "roll it out first, then deploy" could never work for a new
// migration, because the thing that rolls it out ships inside the deploy.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS, said plainly: it no longer fails before the build. A deploy
// carrying a new migration now takes two runs — build, three workers, refusal,
// robot, run again. That is a real price and it buys a gate that can always be
// satisfied. A gate that cannot be is one somebody deletes, and a fast failure
// nobody can clear is not faster, it is just earlier.
//
// ── THE TRAP THIS IS BUILT AROUND ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A naive "any team behind → refuse" would have blocked every deploy on the
// morning of 27 Aug. A leftover "Smoke team" was stranded at an old version and
// could not be migrated at all. A gate that cannot be satisfied is a gate
// somebody deletes, and then the estate has neither the gate nor the prose.
//
// So the population is the robot's: `db_status = 'ready' AND deactivated_at IS
// NULL`. A team the robot SKIPS cannot be brought forward by the remedy, so
// refusing over it would be refusing over something nobody can fix. (Staging
// today holds exactly that team — a third row, `db_status = 'failed'`,
// `schema_version` null. It is invisible to the robot and it is invisible here.)
//
// ── AND WHEN A COUNTED TEAM GENUINELY CANNOT BE MIGRATED ────────────────────
//
// The case above is the one that has actually happened, and skipping it costs
// nothing, because a `failed` team serves nobody. The harder case is a team that
// IS `ready`, IS live, and still will not go forward: its database has been
// deleted underneath us, or one migration hits data only that team has.
//
// Three ways out were considered. Written down because the wrong one is the
// obvious one:
//
//   1. AN ENV-VAR ESCAPE HATCH (`SKIP_MIGRATION_GATE=1`). REFUSED. It is the
//      cheapest to write and the only one that can switch the gate off forever
//      without leaving a mark: it goes into a shell profile or a CI variable
//      during one bad afternoon and nothing ever turns it back on. A gate you
//      can silence invisibly is prose again, with extra steps.
//
//   2. DEACTIVATE THE TEAM — the first answer, and it needs nothing new. A team
//      whose database cannot be migrated is a team the app cannot serve
//      correctly, and saying so in the row is the honest record rather than a
//      workaround. `deactivated_at` takes it out of the robot's population and
//      out of this gate at the same moment, because both read the same fence.
//      Deactivate, never delete, so it is reversible the day the database is.
//
//   3. A DATED WAIVER — the second answer, for a team that must stay live while
//      somebody works out why it is stuck. `MIGRATION_WAIVERS` below, one entry
//      per team, each carrying the version it is stuck at, WHY, and an EXPIRY.
//      It is the shape this repo already uses for every exemption list
//      (SCREEN_WIDTH_EXEMPT, PALETTE_LITERAL_OK, UNWALKED_OK): data, with a
//      reason each, rot-checked so it can only shrink. A waiver whose team is no
//      longer behind turns this red. A waiver whose stated version no longer
//      matches turns this red. A waiver past its expiry turns this red. So the
//      deploy is never stranded, and the waiver is never permanent: renewing it
//      is an edit somebody has to justify in a diff, which is the difference
//      between an exception and a hole.
//
// The list is empty today, and that is the point of it.
//
// The three derivations, the waiver rot check and the whole verdict are EXPORTED
// and locked by
// workers/tenancy/test/migration-gate.test.ts, which runs in `npm run check` and touches no
// network. Everything this gate promises was once a manual proof somebody ran on
// an afternoon; a proof nobody can re-run is a proof that decays.
