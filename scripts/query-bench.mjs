// THE QUERY BENCH — what the query door answers, against REAL staging data,
// without deploying anything.
//
// The lane that built the door was opened by one measured question:
//
//   "how many open tickets from flu clinic, confia and HORSt combined and how
//    many resolved in july 2026 across all?"
//
// Under the old catalogue that cost 369,193 input tokens in a single turn and
// gave up. Three clients meant three calls, and "resolved in July" was
// INEXPRESSIBLE — the ticket door parsed twelve filters, every one single-valued
// and not one of them a date — so the only route to an answer was paging 1,820
// tickets by hand.
//
// This asks it against the same 1,820 tickets, through the shipped engine, and
// prints what it cost.
//
// ── IT MEASURES A BRANCH, WITHOUT DEPLOYING ANYTHING ────────────────────────
//
// Same three properties kb-bench.mjs stands on, and the same reasons:
//
//   • `parseQuery` and `runQuery` are IMPORTED FROM THE WORKING TREE. The code
//     under test is the file you just edited, not a deployment of it.
//   • D1 NEEDS NO STAND-IN. `d1Query` already speaks to Cloudflare's REST door,
//     so pointing `cfg` at the real team database means the rows come out of the
//     real database, exactly as they do in production.
//   • NOTHING IS WRITTEN. Every statement this runs is a SELECT, and the engine
//     it runs has no other kind.
//
// It deliberately does NOT drive the assistant. A model turn on staging spends
// the team's own allowance and would fold two changes into one number — the
// grammar, and whatever else is deployed. What is measured here is the thing
// this lane owns: how many CALLS the question takes, what each one returns, and
// how much of it the model would have to read.
//
// ── HOW TO RUN IT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   node --experimental-transform-types scripts/query-bench.mjs
//
// `--experimental-transform-types`, NOT `--experimental-strip-types`: strip mode
// cannot compile the constructor parameter properties in shared/workers/gating.ts.
// QB_CORE / QB_TEAM point it at another environment; it is read-only in all of them.
