//
// `cf-exec` resolves the account from the folder and puts the id and the key in
// the environment (OPERATIONS.md § 0). Exporting the pair by hand still works and
// the refusal below prints the two lines — it just no longer spells the account
// number out in a comment, which is a copy that cannot be kept current.
//
// glide/files/manifest.json is the source of truth — every file Glide was hosting
// for us, with the row and column that referenced it (scripts/glide-files.mjs put
// it there; RECONCILIATION.md §4.5 says why). This script uploads every one of
// them and writes glide/r2-manifest.json: original URL → bucket + key → content
// type → size → the row it came from. That map is the whole point. The migration
// has not run, no team has an id yet, so nothing can be repointed today; when it
// can be, this file is what it reads.
//
// Safe to re-run, and cheap to. It LISTS the bucket first and skips every object
// already there at the size the manifest recorded, so a second run uploads
// nothing and says so. A missing local copy is not a failure either — it falls
// back to fetching the original Google URL, so this works on a machine that has
// never run glide-files.mjs.
//
// ── WHERE THE OBJECTS GO, AND WHY IT IS A BUCKET OF THEIR OWN ────────────────
//
// These files belong to no team. There are no accounts yet, no team ids to key
// them under, and no gated row that points at them — so for now they must sit
// somewhere that is provably NOT servable to anyone, and be copied into proper
// team-scoped keys later, when the migration knows the ids.
//
// The two candidates were a reserved prefix inside kwapso-media[-staging], and a
// bucket of their own. The prefix loses, and not on taste — it is measurably
// public. `serveMedia` (shared/workers/front-door.ts) answers /media/<key> by
// calling bucket.get(key) for ANY key that clears `safeMediaKey`. There is no
// prefix allow-list on that path and no session check: the key IS the credential,
// a deliberate, recorded decision (SCOPE ch.06). Measured against staging on
// 11 Aug 2026, `GET /media/users/01KZJA16ZG5ZHFDRAMF82TSFSH` — an ordinary key
// listed straight out of kwapso-media-staging — returned `200 image/jpeg` from
// the agency door AND from the portal door. So every key in the media bucket is
// a live public URL to whoever knows it, and the key for an archive object would
// be derived from its Glide path: the very thing already published in the Google
// URLs we are retiring. A reserved prefix would republish the clients' files
// under our own domain on day one.
//
// So: a bucket of their own, bound by nothing. Three facts make "cannot be served
// publicly" a property rather than an intention, and `assertPrivate` re-checks all
// three BEFORE a byte is written, on every run, in both environments:
//
//   1. no wrangler config under workers/ names this bucket, so neither front door
//      has a binding that could reach it. Only those two workers are public at
//      all — workers/gateway/test/public-surface.test.ts holds that line per
//      worker, per environment;
//   2. the bucket's managed r2.dev address is disabled — and the script FETCHES
//      that address to be sure, rather than believing the flag;
//   3. it has no custom domain.
//
// Then, after uploading, it proves the negative the only honest way there is: it
// takes a key the R2 API has just confirmed exists and asks both public front
// doors for it. A 404 from a door that cannot be shown the object is the evidence.
