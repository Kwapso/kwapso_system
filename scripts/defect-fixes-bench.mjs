// THE TWO-DEFECT BENCH — does the model's FINAL TEXT change with the two new
// prompt sentences (staleness honesty, no internal tool names), given the SAME
// synthetic tool result both times?
//
// Unlike agent-routing-bench.mjs (which measures which door a FRESH question
// opens), this measures what the model SAYS after a tool has already answered —
// so the conversation here is three turns: system, user question, an assistant
// tool call + its result, then the model's follow-up text. The tool results are
// built from REAL staging data (FluClinic's actual meeting rows and the actual
// get_meeting_transcript "not found" message), so the model is judging real
// material, not an invented shape.
//
// Reads AGENT_MODEL off wrangler.jsonc, same refusal-on-disagreement guard as
// agent-routing-bench.mjs. Run it against a candidate prompt change and against
// the baseline (`git stash` the change between runs, since both live in the
// same working tree) — never against DEFAULT_AGENT_MODEL.

//
// ── DEFECT 2 IS A CLOSED, DEFINITIVE NEGATIVE RESULT — 31 AUG 2026, ON
//    @cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b. READ THIS BEFORE TRYING AN EIGHTH ROUND.
//
// Seven rounds, each 5 trials, none of them moved "does the reply leak a real
// tool name or say run/call" off 0/5:
//
//   round 1  baseline (no change at all)                                0/5
//   round 2  system-prompt rule, short ("never name a tool...")         1/5 (fluke — never replicated)
//   round 3  system-prompt rule, + a concrete before/after example      0/5
//   round 4  system-prompt rule, names the `message` field explicitly
//            as "written for you, not to relay"                        0/5
//   round 5  get_meeting_transcript's `message` field (meetings.ts)
//            rewritten as a fact, no tool name in it at all             0/5
//   round 6  round 5's rewrite, PLUS the tool's own static description
//            (tool-catalog.ts) also stripped of the tool-name mention   0/5
//   round 7  = round 6, re-confirmed after the stale `list_meetings`
//            cross-reference was fixed in the same edit                 0/5
//
// Rounds 2-4 were reverted (workers/data-ops/src/lib/agent.ts is back to its
// pre-investigation state). Rounds 5-6 were KEPT — both are real, independent
// improvements (a fact instead of an instruction; a stale `list_meetings`
// reference from an unrelated fold, fixed) — but neither closed the leak, and
// nothing in round 7 did either.
//
// THE READING: every text source that could plausibly be "the instruction the
// model is echoing" was tried and removed — the system prompt, the runtime
// `message` field, the tool's own schema description — and the leak did not
// move once. That rules out "the model is quoting nearby text" as the
// mechanism. What's left: a tool's NAME is in its JSON schema, sent on every
// single step regardless of any description, and the model treats that
// identifier as ordinary, correct vocabulary for describing what it's about to
// do — the same reflex a coding assistant has saying "run npm install". No
// content edit reaches that, because the content isn't where it comes from.
//
// NOT BUILT: an output-side guard that scans the model's own reply for
// tool-name-shaped strings before it reaches the user (pagingGuard's shape,
// applied to content instead of call counts). Owner-adjacent call, 31 Aug
// 2026: declined for now — new machinery on every turn's output path for a
// symptom hit once, real risk of mangling a correct answer, and "too much
// code is a defect" is a standing law here. Left as the honest next idea for
// whoever revisits this, one they should weigh rather than reach for first:
// tool names that read as ENGLISH PROSE rather than snake_case identifiers
// might dissolve the reflex on its own, since the leak is arguably the names
// being quotable at all — but R19, R22 and R27 all key off the literal name,
// so that is a rename across the whole machine surface, not a today decision.
//
// ── DEFECT 1, BUILT — see query-grammar.ts's `staleCheck` and query-engine.ts's
//    `unlinked` field. The suggested prompt-only fallback (an explicit "repeat
//    the query without the account filter before answering" instruction) was
//    tried here first and never produced a single broadened follow-up call in
//    5 trials — the model answered straight from the stale row every time.
//    That is why the fix moved into the DOOR rather than staying a sentence:
//    see the query-engine.ts header for the shape.
//
//    VERIFIED IT SHIPS (npm run check, 5 new tests in query-engine.test.ts,
//    mutation-proved). THEN ONE BENCH ROUND, `BENCH_ONLY=defect1_staleness`,
//    to answer the only question that mattered once the field existed: does
//    the model actually read it? Same synthetic conversation as before, one
//    change — the FLUCLINIC_MEETINGS_RESULT fixture now carries the real
//    shape the door actually returns (`records`, not the old fixture's
//    `meetings` — its own long-standing inaccuracy) plus `unlinked: {count:
//    3}`, the real number measured on staging, and the tool's own
//    description (tool-catalog.ts) tells the model to look for and use it.
//
//      round 8 (payload carries `unlinked`, description documents it)   0/5
//      round 9 (description's wording mirrors `unmatched`'s own MUST-say
//               pattern — the one proven case in this exact door — instead
//               of a field left to be discovered)                       0/5
//
// Round 9 was the best remaining hypothesis and it was worth the one round:
// `unmatched` works because its description doesn't just mention the field,
// it says MUST and gives the sentence shape, in the SAME description this
// tool already carries. Rewriting `unlinked`'s own sentence to match that
// pattern exactly — MUST, same sentence as the count, a worked example — was
// the cheapest test of "is this a wording problem or a field-shape problem"
// available, and it used a pattern already proven in this file rather than
// inventing a third approach. Still 0/5. So it is not that the field was
// merely undocumented — a `MUST` sentence sitting right beside a working one
// did not move it either, and the reasonable conclusion is that this
// particular model does not reliably act on an instruction to relay a
// SECOND, unscoped fact next to the one it was actually asked for, at least
// not from a sibling JSON field, however it's described. HARD STOP here —
// no round 10.
//
// A payload field the model never reads is exactly the dead weight this
// verification step existed to catch, and it caught it: none of the ten
// trials across both rounds mentioned the field, the count, or anything
// resembling the hedge, and several made the SAME single-meeting follow-up
// call defect 2's scenario measures, ignoring the `unlinked` count sitting
// one field over in the same tool result — the two defects share a
// trajectory a real turn could hit at once, worth knowing for whoever works
// either one next. Reported rather than chased further: the door change
// stands on its own merits regardless of what this one model does with it —
// an MCP caller, a script, a person reading the JSON, and every FUTURE model
// get an honest signal that did not exist before, built at the data layer,
// opt-in, bounded, mutation-proved through a real HTTP route against a real
// database. What is unfixed is one specific chat model choosing to relay it.
// Those are two different sentences, and this file should never be read as
// saying only one of them.
