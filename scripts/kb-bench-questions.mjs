// THE QUESTION SET the bench measures against, and the answer key beside it.
//
// AUTHORED OFF THE MATERIAL, not off the pipeline. Every `cites` names a source
// that is really in the staging base and really contains the answer, and every
// `refuse` names something the agency demonstrably has nothing on — checked by
// reading the rows, not by asking the retriever and writing down what it said.
// A key derived from the retriever's own output measures nothing.
//
// THREE KINDS OF CLAIM, because retrieval fails in three different ways:
//
//   cites   FINDING. One of these strings appears in a cited title.
//   refuse  HONESTY (R23). A question about something that never happened must
//           come back as "we have nothing on that". A confident answer here is
//           worse than no answer at all, and it is the failure a relevance floor
//           exists to prevent.
//   spread  USEFULNESS. Six passages that are one thing said six ways is not a
//           six-passage answer. `spread` is the number of DISTINCT subjects the
//           citations must cover once the calendar envelopes ("Invitation:",
//           "Notes:") are stripped back to the meeting they are about.
//
// A question may carry more than one; all of them must hold for it to pass.
//
// ── AND A SECOND KEY, FOR THE HALF A PERSON READS (--compose) ───────────────
//
// The three above grade RETRIEVAL. `--compose` grades the ANSWER, against the
// three things the owner actually named when he called the answers poor:
// "beating around the bush, unnecessary references to files that were not
// important, and the big juicy files it should have touched, it didn't".
//
//   lead   BEATING AROUND THE BUSH. At least one of these must appear in the
//          answer's FIRST SENTENCE. Authored off the material — these are things
//          the meeting or the document actually says, so a first sentence
//          carrying one of them is a first sentence that answered, and a first
//          sentence carrying none is a preamble however fluent it reads.
//   topic  FILES THAT WERE NOT IMPORTANT. A cited title must contain one of
//          these to have earned its place. Defaults to `cites` where a question
//          does not need a wider set.
//
// The third thing he named — the big juicy file it should have touched — needs
// no key at all, and that is the point: a passage whose whole text is its own
// title and a date cannot have earned a citation slot for ANY question, so the
// bench detects it from the material rather than from a list (see `hollow` in
// kb-bench.mjs). It had to be measured that way because a title key cannot see
// it: an empty placeholder for a meeting and the 92-chunk transcript of that
// meeting have exactly the same title.

  // three FluClinic meetings and missed the task — so the fuller and more
  // courteous the question, the worse the answer.
  //
  // It was blamed on the proportional term floor and that was wrong twice over:
  // the floor's bypass was already there, and it was switched off for this exact
  // reference by a rarity cap somebody guessed at (20 chunks; 3144 is in 56).
  // With the cap measured, the word arm finds the chunk — and then loses it, ten
  // to one, to a fusion weight set for ordinary questions. Both had to move. See
