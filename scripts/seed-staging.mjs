//
//   node scripts/glide-transform.mjs          # writes glide/normalised.json
//   node scripts/seed-staging.mjs staging
//
// THREE RULES THIS SCRIPT LIVES BY.
//
// 1. IT WRITES THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR. Every row below is created by a real HTTP
//    call to a real gated endpoint, signed in as a real person — never by
//    touching D1. That is the whole point: seeding this way proves the doors
//    work, exercises the permission spine, and leaves genuine activity rows and
//    live pings behind, exactly as a person clicking would.
// 2. IT IS IDEMPOTENT. Every record is matched on a stable natural key first
//    (a company's name, a person's email, a story's title, a request's
//    description) and skipped when it is already there. Run it twice and the
//    second run creates nothing.
// 3. IT CHECKS THE FENCE FROM THE OUTSIDE. A seed that writes rows the fence
//    would never allow is worse than no seed — it makes a leak look like normal
//    data. So the last thing it does is sign in AS a client login and prove it
//    sees its own company's world and nothing from any other one.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS SCRIPT CANNOT DO, SAID OUT LOUD RATHER THAN FUDGED.
//
// • EVERY ROW IS CREATED TODAY. No door in the base accepts a timestamp — every
//   `created_at` is stamped server-side at the write (that is what makes the
//   audit trail worth reading). So two years of history arrives dated this
//   afternoon. The real dates are all in glide/normalised.json; nothing is lost,
//   it simply is not reachable through the front door. See HISTORY below.
// • THE AUTHOR OF A SEEDED REQUEST IS WHOEVER SEEDED IT, for the same reason:
//   the actor comes from the session, never from the body. The real reporter's
//   address is carried in normalised.json beside each request.
//
// AND ONE IT WILL NOT DO: EMAIL A REAL CLIENT. Inviting somebody sends them a
// real message, so `ownInbox` below refuses any address that is not the owner's
// own — the client logins are plus-addressed variants of it, attached to real
// companies as real contacts. Real contacts are seeded as records, never as
// logins.
//
// STAGING ONLY. SCOPE ch.13: production is deliberately empty and parked, and it
// refuses the test-login door outright (auth's ENVIRONMENT check), so this
// script cannot sign anyone in there even if you insist.
//
// Needs TEST_LOGIN_KEY and ADMIN_KEY in the environment (they live in
// ~/.config/kwapso/keys.env — export them, never paste them):

  // anyone else's records — and the doors below say so themselves, which is the
  // point of the list.
  //
  // THIS ROLE IS THE WORST CASE ON PURPOSE, NOT A DESCRIPTION OF A GOOD ONE.
  // `selectable_data` is DELIBERATELY still granted even though every one of its
  // doors now refuses a client login outright (d7512f1). It is not a leftover: a
  // real owner building their own client role would plausibly tick it, so leaving
  // it on makes this seeded client the WORST CASE — a caller holding rights the
  // doors must refuse on grounds other than the role. R21's enumeration reads
  // these rights to decide which doors to walk, so taking them away would quietly
  // stop the check testing the very doors that were leaking a week ago. The
  // defence must not depend on how carefully the role was built.
  //
  // `learning` sat beside it and made the same point until 17 Aug 2026, when the
  // learning library was purged outright. A right on a module that no longer
  // exists walks no doors — the permission writer builds the sheet from
  // TEAM_MODULES — so it went with the module rather than lingering as a word
  // nobody could trace.
  //
  // `agent` is here for the same reason, and it is the sharpest case of it. An
  // owner does not have to be careless to grant it: the DEFAULT Viewer template
  // ships `agent: read + create` (workers/tenancy/src/team-schema.ts), and
  // "clone Viewer, untick the obvious things" is how a client role gets built.
  // Without this line R21 read the agent doors as unreachable and skipped the
  // whole surface — the one place in the app where a client login could attach
  // eight CSVs, be shown the import catalogue's inner shape, and spend the team's
  // AI allowance that the portal was built never to touch. A right the seed does
  // not hold is a door the law does not walk.
  //
  // `processes` is the one right on this list a client GENUINELY needs, rather
  // than one held to make the worst case worse. It is what opens their value
  // screen — the savings drilled App → Process → Step — and `create` is what
  // lets them say something on a map, one of the six things SCOPE says a contact
  // can do. The AUTHORING doors on the same module (map a process, edit a step,
  // cut a version) hold the same right and refuse a portal caller at the door,
  // which is exactly the shape R21 exists to check: the rights let them through
  // and the door turns them away.
  //
  // `commercials` is DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and it is the only module on this list
  // that could not be here even as a worst case. Every one of its doors refuses a
  // client login anyway (R24 + the refusal-symmetry suite), so granting it would
  // test one more refusal — but the seed is also a working example an owner
  // copies, and a Client role with a tick beside "Rates & margin" is a screenshot
  // nobody should ever be able to take.

    // correct the wording, and drag them into the order they want — and both are
    // `help:edit`. What makes that safe is not this line: it is the LOCK (both
    // stop the moment a staff member reads the ticket) and the four doors on the
    // same right that now refuse a portal caller outright — status, bulk-status,
    // bulk-status-by-filter and archive. "Resolved" is our word, and SCOPE says
    // there is no client-side reopen button.
