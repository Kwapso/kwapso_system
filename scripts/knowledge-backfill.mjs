// THE BACKFILL — fill a live environment's knowledge base with the material the
// app already holds, before anybody starts using it.
//
//   node scripts/knowledge-backfill.mjs staging
//   node scripts/knowledge-backfill.mjs production
//
// Needs, in the environment: TEST_LOGIN_KEY (the same staging-only admin door
// the smoke uses) or KNOWLEDGE_COOKIE (a session cookie you already hold —
// production has no test-login door, by design), and BACKFILL_EMAIL for the
// account to act as.
//
// IT IS A LOOP OVER ONE DOOR, and that is the whole point. `POST
// /api/content/knowledge/sync` does a bounded slice and answers `caughtUp`; the
// 15-minute cron calls the SAME engine with the SAME bounds. So there is no
// second ingestion path to keep in step, no script-only SQL, and nothing here
// that has not already been exercised by the cron on every other tick. It writes
// through a gated door as a real signed-in person, so every source it creates
// carries the same audit trail as one typed by hand.
//
// SAFE TO RE-RUN, and safe to interrupt. Each kind keeps its own cursor in the
// team's database, a row whose text has not changed is skipped before it is
// chunked, and a source somebody deliberately took away is never put back. Stop
// it halfway and the next run — or the next cron tick — carries on from there.
