// WHAT THE ASSISTANT PAYS FOR BEFORE ANYBODY TYPES A WORD.
//
// Every model call in an agent turn re-sends the same preamble — the system
// prompt plus the whole tool catalogue — and a turn makes several. That preamble
// is the largest single line in this product's bill, and until 2026-09-05 its
// size was quoted in three places from three different measurements, none of
// them reproducible: "~109 KB" in tools.ts, "roughly 46,000 tokens" in
// prompt-cache.test.ts, "37.6K" and "49KB" in two paragraphs of model.ts.
//
// So this measures it, on the working tree, in one command, and prints the
// arithmetic COSTS.md quotes. It makes NO model call and costs nothing: it
// bundles two pure functions and reads the length of what they return.
//
//     node scripts/measure-preamble.mjs
//     node scripts/measure-preamble.mjs --json
//
// THE CANARY IS THE POINT. An import that silently resolves to an empty
// catalogue would print a beautifully small preamble and a wonderfully cheap
// turn — the shape of every wrong measurement in this repo's history. If either
// half comes back empty, or the tool count is implausible, this exits non-zero
// and says so rather than printing a number.
