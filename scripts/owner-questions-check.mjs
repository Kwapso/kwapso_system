// THE TWO QUESTIONS THE OWNER ASKED AND THE APP COULD NOT ANSWER.
//
// 1 Sep 2026. He asked staging's assistant two things and got nothing useful:
//
//   "What is Alex's full name?"        — nothing anywhere in the base said who
//                                        his own colleagues are. Coverage.
//   "What was the latest week planning about?" — answered from a 2027 calendar
//                                        shell. Question understanding.
//
// Both are now permanent questions in the retrieval bench
// (`scripts/kb-bench-questions.mjs`). This is the OTHER half, and the two are
// different claims: the bench measures RETRIEVAL against the index directly,
// running the working tree's code with no deploy. This asks the DEPLOYED
// ASSISTANT, through the real chat door, as a real signed-in person — model,
// prompt, tool catalogue, permission gate and all.
//
// A bench pass and a live pass can disagree, and when they do the disagreement is
// the finding: retrieval can hold the answer while the model never reaches for
// the door, which is exactly what the routing bench measures separately. So this
// asserts the sentence a PERSON would read, and prints the whole reply when it
// fails, because "it did not say Stadlmair" is not a diagnosis on its own.
//
//   node scripts/owner-questions-check.mjs
//
// WHAT IT COSTS: two assistant turns on the team's own allowance. That is the
// price of asking the deployed thing rather than a stand-in for it, and it is
// the only way this claim can be made honestly.
//
// STAGING ONLY. It signs in through the admin test-login door, which production
// refuses outright.
