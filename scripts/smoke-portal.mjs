// CLIENT PORTAL smoke test — the OTHER front door, proven against live staging.
//
// `deploy:staging` shipped eight workers and then ran one smoke that never once
// touched `kwapso-portal-staging`. Half the product — the half a CLIENT reaches
// — went out unverified on every deploy. This is that half's suite.
//
// IT RUNS AGAINST THE PORTAL'S OWN HOSTNAME, and that is the whole point rather
// than a detail of configuration. R21 was earned twice by the same substitution:
// a door the portal gateway withheld was still being served to the same person
// at the agency origin, because a client login is an ordinary team member
// holding an ordinary role. So this script signs ONE person in at BOTH addresses
// and asks each door twice — 404 at the client's hostname (the allow-list never
// named it) and 403 at ours (the door itself refuses them). A check that only
// ever knocked on the portal would pass over exactly the hole that has now been
// dug twice.
//
// WHAT IT PROVES, in the order it proves it:
//
//   · a client signs in AT THE PORTAL, through the portal's own auth doors;
//   · EVERY door on `PORTAL_DOORS` answers there — the census is derived from
//     the gateway's own table and from what this script actually called, so a
//     door opened tomorrow is an untested door today and the run goes red;
//   · THE ACCOUNT FENCE (SCOPE ch.06): standing in one company, every door is
//     attacked with another company's ids — by list, by search, by id, and by
//     write. Every negative has BAIT proved to exist first, from the account
//     that should see it, because "they cannot see it" passes trivially when
//     there is nothing to see and that is exactly how a fence test stays green
//     over an open hole;
//   · A DELIVERABLE'S VISIBILITY IS PER ROW AND REVOCABLE — hidden, shared,
//     then un-shared, and the third state takes the FILE URL with it (a real
//     bug, found the week of 2026-08-19);
//   · R24 — no door reading the agency's own cost is reachable at the client's
//     hostname. The doors are DERIVED from `internal-money.ts`'s own exports,
//     the same walk `web/test/rules.test.ts` makes, so a fifth one added
//     tomorrow is asked the question tomorrow;
//   · every resource in `PORTAL_LISTENERS` has a door behind it that answers —
//     a listener with no live door is a screen that goes quietly stale.
//
// TWO ADDRESSES, TWO ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
//
//   SMOKE_BASE         the AGENCY front door (staff build the world here, and
//                      the client is asked the R21 question here)
//   SMOKE_PORTAL_BASE  the CLIENT front door — everything the client does
//
//   TEST_LOGIN_KEY=… node scripts/smoke-portal.mjs
//
// FIXED FIXTURES, so repeat runs prove idempotency instead of littering: one
// role, two companies, one contact, two apps, two maps, two tickets, one to-do
// and two deliverables, all found-or-created by name. The second run creates
// nothing.
//
// Exits non-zero on any failure.
