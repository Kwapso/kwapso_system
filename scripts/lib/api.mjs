// The ONE HTTP helper the deploy scripts share. smoke-staging, smoke-mcp and
// seed-staging each carried a near-identical `api()` — and only seed-staging's copy
// had a timeout, so `smoke:staging` (the LAST step of `deploy:staging`) could hang a
// deploy on a wedged host forever. R11 lives here now, in one place no script can
// forget: the machine check for R11 scans `workers/*/src` .ts only, which is exactly
// why these .mjs copies were free to drift.

/** R11: never hang on an external service. Generous enough for a cold Worker start
 * on a fresh deploy, short enough that a wedged host fails the run instead of the day.
 *
 * OVERRIDABLE, added 11 Sep 2026, for exactly one shape of caller. 30s is right for
 * a smoke check, where a door that has not answered in half a minute IS the finding.
 * It is wrong for `knowledge-backfill.mjs` immediately after a wipe: a slice there
 * re-reads and re-EMBEDS 25 sources per kind from nothing, and the first ticks
 * legitimately run past 30s. Measured that day — three slices aborted client-side at
 * 30s while the worker carried on and finished the work, so the script reported
 * failure over a door that was succeeding, which is the worst way to be wrong.
 *
 * The default does not move. A caller that knows its own work is long says so:
 * `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS=180000 node scripts/knowledge-backfill.mjs staging`. Anything
 * unset, unparseable or non-positive falls back to 30s, so the smoke path cannot be
 * weakened by a stray environment variable. */

 * single 30-second stall killed a twenty-minute seed twice in a row — once at
 * the tickets, once at the contact links, both of them requests that would have
 * succeeded on the next try. A run that dies on one slow socket is a run nobody
 * can finish against a cold worker.
 *

 * answer came back, so trying again cannot do the write twice. NOT retried: any
 * HTTP status at all. A 500 is an answer, a 400 is an answer, and re-sending a
