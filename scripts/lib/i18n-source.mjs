 * finished. The only fix available at the call site was to wrap each branch in
 * `t(...)` by hand (web/components/account-form-dialog.tsx says so in a comment),
 * which works for the four somebody remembered and for none written afterwards.
 *
 * The two operands of `&&` are NOT treated alike: `cond && "Saved"` renders its
 * RIGHT side and tests its left, so descending into the left would harvest the
 * string out of a comparison (`kind === "asc" && …`) and put a sort direction in
 * the catalogue. `||` and `??` can render either side, so both are taken. No
 * other operator is descended, which is why `===` inside a condition is never

 * carry three of the twenty-nine languages by hand. `shared/scale.ts` holds
 * "Compact", "Comfortable" and "Large", rendered through `t(step.label)` with

 * remember to widen it, which is the exact failure R28 exists to end

 * And it draws the line where the law draws it: `shared/workers/record-link.ts`
 * says "Open the ticket" in an EMAIL, no front door imports it, and it stays
 * out — a fact about the code rather than a judgement somebody made once.

 * fails to reach that says something a person reads. */

 *   toast       toast.success("Saved.")        the sentence after a write
 *   t-call      t("Save")                      a string ALREADY adopted
 *
 * The last one is what keeps the pair honest. Without it, wrapping a string in
 * `t(...)` would delete it from the extraction — the catalogue would lose its
 * key the moment the call site started using it, and the app would go back to
 * English with a green build.
 *
 * FIELD-LABEL IS THE SEVENTH, AND IT IS THE SAME WORDS AS `property`. A recipe
 * field is built by `field(column, label)` (web/lib/screens.ts), so its label is
 * an ARGUMENT rather than a `label:` property — and `property` only ever looked
 * at the second. Every column heading in the app was therefore outside the
 * catalogue: the recipes' own, and the tables a screen composes for itself. The
 * law that exists to catch a sentence shipping in English could not see the one
 * kind of sentence a person reads at the top of every column of every table.
 *
 * ONLY THE SECOND ARGUMENT, because the first is a COLUMN NAME — data, not
 * words. That is the same line `translateRecipe` draws when it translates
 * `field.label` and leaves `field.column` alone, and drawing it differently here
 * would put a database column in the catalogue and, one codemod later, in
 * German. Narrow by construction, exactly as `scope` above is.
 *
 * JSX-CHILD IS THE SIXTH, AND IT IS THE SAME WORDS AS THE FIRST. `<p>Save</p>`
 * and `<p>{busy ? "Saving…" : "Save"}</p>` are one sentence on screen and two
 * different syntax nodes underneath — a JsxText and a JsxExpression — and only
 * the first was ever looked at. A person cannot see which one a developer typed;
 * the reader who chose German only saw that one of the two was still in English.
 * Every OTHER kind of child expression (`{count}`, `{items.map(…)}`, `{cond &&
 * <Row/>}`) yields no plain string and is skipped by `literalTexts` without a
 * special case, which is why this position costs one branch rather than a
 * heuristic. */
