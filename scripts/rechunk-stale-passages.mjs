// THE RECORD WAS MENDED AND THE PASSAGES WERE NOT.
//
// ── WHAT IS ACTUALLY WRONG, AND WHY "NOTHING IS BROKEN" WAS THE WRONG TEST ──
//
// Google's own profile carried the owner's display name mis-decoded ("Ãlaap"),
// and wrote that spelling into everything it composed. `repair-mangled-titles`
// mended the SOURCE rows on 31 Aug 2026 and `shared/workers/mojibake.ts` now
// mends on the way in, so nothing new arrives wrong.
//
// The CHUNKS were built from the pre-repair text and were never rebuilt.
// Measured on staging, 1 Sep 2026:
//
//     23 chunks across 17 sources still contain "Ã"
//     0 of those 17 SOURCES contain it — every one of them is already clean
//
// So open the record and his name is right; let the assistant QUOTE it and his
// name is wrong. That is the literal complaint this whole workstream opened on,
// surviving in the one place a reader actually meets it.
//
// I FIRST CHECKED THE WRONG THING and it is worth writing down: the 17 are fully
// chunked, fully indexed, fully embedded and carry no index error, so "is this
// broken?" answered no — a true measurement of a question nobody asked. The
// question is whether what a person READS says the right thing.
//
// ── WHY IT WILL NEVER HEAL ON ITS OWN ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// `content_hash IS NULL` means "re-chunk me when you next read me", and for a
// windowed Google lane the next read only comes if the row is still inside
// Google's listing. These 17 have aged out of it. Nothing will ever meet them
// again, so the flag is a request nobody will service — the same class
// `repair-mangled-titles.mjs` closes on ("the rows that have already fallen out
// of Google's window and will never be swept again").
//
// ── HOW IT MENDS THEM: BY RUNNING THE APP'S OWN CODE ────────────────────────
//
// It imports `indexSource` from the working tree and calls it with `force`,
// exactly as the sweep would. Not a reimplementation — the same chunker, the
// same embedding model, the same vector ids, the same counters. A script that
// wrote its own version of this would be a second definition of what a passage
// is, and the day the two drifted the base would hold chunks nothing else could
// reproduce. `env.AI` and `env.KNOWLEDGE_INDEX` are the REST doors standing in
// for the bindings, which is the shape kb-bench.mjs already proved.
//
// COST: about 23 embeddings, a few neurons. Nothing else is touched.
