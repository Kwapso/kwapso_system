// Reconcile the owner's narrated coverage list against the kit on disk.
// His list is a transcription — "as spec ratio" is aspect-ratio, "cue" is queue,
// "dialogue" is dialog. Mapping them here once beats four lanes each guessing.
//
// SELF-CONTAINED, ON PURPOSE (30 Aug 2026 rewrite). The previous version read
// its inputs from /tmp/kit-components.txt, /tmp/kit-compositions.txt and
// /tmp/app-imports.txt — three files nothing in the repo generated, so every
// lane that ran this script first ran a hand-typed shell incantation to
// produce them, and a lane that got the incantation slightly wrong got a
// slightly wrong census with no way to tell. `node scripts/kit-coverage.mjs`
// is now the whole command; it walks the filesystem itself.
//
// REACHED, NOT MERELY IMPORTED — via a walk that follows BOTH languages the
// kit ships in. A JS/TS file names a sibling with `from "@shared/ui/…"` or a
// relative specifier; a CSS file names one with `@import "…"`. Counting only
// the first missed `motion` entirely: both front doors' globals.css pull in
// `foundations/motion/motion.css` by a relative `@import`, which no
// import-string grep for `@shared/ui/…` will ever match, so the census called
// it unreached while every screen in the app was animating with it. That is
// the SEVENTH time this walk undercounted in the same direction — six earlier
// misses (`notes` through Comments, `folder` through tabs, `title` through the
// kit's own record-detail, `progress` through file-upload, and two more) were
// found by hand and filed as footnotes while the headline number stayed wrong.
// `motion` was the one nobody could find by hand, because there is no import
// LINE to grep — the reference lives in a directive JS's own import syntax
// does not have.
//
// So the walk is generic over the resolution rule, not motion-specific: a
// `resolveSpec` step that understands `@shared/ui/…`, a relative path, and an
// `@import` string identically, feeding one BFS closure. A part the app
// reaches through another part it has adopted is adopted — that is what a
// person looking at the screen would say, and the number exists to answer
// that question rather than a question about which of two import syntaxes
// was used. It cannot over-count: nothing enters the set without a path back
// to a file the app itself names, which is why `heatmap` stays unadopted even
// though `pulse-band` imports it — pulse-band is not reached either.
//
// EXPORTED for the law that checks this (`web/test/rules.test.ts`, R45): the
// test imports `computeReachability` from this plain .mjs file directly —
// vitest/esbuild take a JS module with no transform needed — so the checked
// law and the human-facing checklist can never compute two different
// answers. `main()` below is the CLI: read the repo, write KIT-COVERAGE.md,
// print the summary. Everything before it is the reusable computation.
