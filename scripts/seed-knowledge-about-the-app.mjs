// PUT THE APP'S OWN STORY INTO ITS OWN KNOWLEDGE BASE.
//
//   TEST_LOGIN_KEY=… node scripts/seed-knowledge-about-the-app.mjs staging
//
// So that "what is a sprint here", "why is a client called an account", "who can
// see the margin" and "why does the ticket module say help" are questions the
// team can ask the app instead of asking a person — and get the answer the
// PROJECT actually holds, not a plausible one.
//
// THREE RULES, and the first is the one that matters.
//
// 1. NOTHING IS WRITTEN FROM MEMORY. Every document below is assembled from a
//    file in this repository: the chapters come out of SCOPE.html's own blocks,
//    the vocabulary out of shared/glossary.ts, the laws out of the rule registry,
//    and the screen guide out of the page registry the sidebar itself reads. If
//    the app changes and this is re-run, the knowledge changes with it. A
//    knowledge base about the app, written from an agent's recollection of the
//    app, is the exact thing R23 exists to prevent.
// 2. IT WRITES THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR, signed in as a real person, gated like
//    any other write — same as the seed.
// 3. IT IS IDEMPOTENT on the title. Run it twice and the second run corrects
//    what is there rather than making a second copy; that is what makes it safe
//    to re-run after the docs move on.
