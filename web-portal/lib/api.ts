// The ONE place the client portal talks to the workers. Same-origin /api calls —
// the PORTAL gateway routes them — so cookies flow automatically.
//
// This file is deliberately a SHORT list, and it is the portal's honest
// inventory: every function here corresponds to a door named in the portal
// gateway's allow-list (workers/portal-gateway/src/index.ts), and a test proves
// the two agree. If a screen needs something that isn't here, that is a
// conversation about opening a door — not an import away.
//
// It is NOT web/lib/api.ts with a filter. The agency client carries ~90 calls
// across roles, invites, imports and the assistant; this list is a fraction of
// it. The COUNT is deliberately not written down here: it was "fourteen" for
// long enough to become wrong, in this comment and in ARCHITECTURE.md at the
// same time, because a number in prose is a number nothing checks. The door
// table in workers/portal-gateway/src/index.ts is the truth, and the fence
// suite walks this file against it.
