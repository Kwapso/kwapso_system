"use client"

// R15 on the CLIENT surface: every resource the portal's screens depend on has a
// listener here, so a reply typed by the agency lands on the client's screen
// without them reloading anything.
//
// The portal publishes NOTHING — it only reads and raises. So the "no deaf
// publishers" half of R15 is satisfied by construction: there is no new resource
// string on this surface. What this file owns is the other half — that the
// resources the portal READS are actually listened to.
//
// Coarse, not row-level, and that is a deliberate difference from the agency
// side. The agency's registry patches a single row into a cached list because
// its lists are long and its screens are dense. A client has one company and a
// handful of tickets; dropping the key and re-reading is simpler code, one
// round-trip, and indistinguishable to the person watching.
