"use client"

// TICKETS — everything this client has asked us, newest first.
//
// No tabs — still, and now for a better reason than the one this comment used
// to give. It said a client's list was "already all theirs" because the ticket
// fence pinned a portal caller to the tickets they personally raised, so a My /
// All strip would offer a choice between a list and the same list. Since the
// owner ruled that a contact sees their COMPANY's questions (11 Aug 2026) those
// two lists genuinely differ, and the door serves both (`?scope=mine`). We are
// still not drawing the strip: this screen is the company's record of what it
// has asked us, and a filter is not what makes that readable — attribution is.
// A row saying WHO raised it is the open piece of work here, and it is not a
// one-liner: `raiserName` can be a staff name the day staff raise a ticket on an
// account's behalf (SCOPE ch.07), so it needs the same server-side decision the
// thread's authors now get (lib/help listReplies) rather than a field the screen
// prints and hopes about.
// R3 is satisfied by having no toggle at all rather than a prettier one.
//
// R14: the list PAGES. "Show older" walks the opaque cursor the door handed us,
// so a client four years in can still reach their first ticket.
