"use client"

// WHAT WE HANDED OVER — the client's own shelf.
//
// The owner, 18 August 2026, asked whether a client should see deliverables:
// "yes of course.. the deliverables are for them! but only once we mark it as
// visible yeah?" So this screen exists, and every row on it is one somebody at
// the agency deliberately shared. Neither fence is drawn here: the door answers
// with the caller's own company's SHARED rows and nothing else, so this file has
// no filter to get right and no id to pass. It renders what it was given.
//
// GROUPED BY THE SYSTEM IT BELONGS TO, because that is how a person looks for
// it. Nobody thinks "where is that PDF"; they think "what came with the
// dispatch app". A client with one system sees one heading and loses nothing.
//
// NO STAFF NAMES, ANYWHERE — and not because this file declines to draw them.
// `ClientDeliverable` has no `creatorName` and no `editorName` to draw (SCOPE
// ch.06: the portal shows the work, never which staff member is doing it), so
// the restraint is in the shape rather than in the discipline of whoever edits
// this next.
//
// ONE THING IT REFUSES TO DO IS LIE ABOUT A FILE. Some deliverables point at a
// link anybody can open (a Loom recording, a Google Doc, an API reference) and
// some point at bytes we host. Today the hosted ones live in a bucket only the
// AGENCY's hostname serves, so their address does not resolve here. Rather than
// print a link that 404s, the card says the file has to come from us. See the
// note on `reachableHere` below — this is a real gap, honestly drawn, not a
// design.

/** CAN THIS ADDRESS BE OPENED FROM *THIS* HOSTNAME?
 *
 * The agency's front door serves two buckets — `/media/` (shared: logos, photos,
 * the files on a ticket) and `/media/internal/` (the agency's own: brand
 * material, knowledge-base documents, staff records). The client's front door
 * binds only the first, which is right: `/media/internal/` is a capability URL
 * onto a bucket full of things no client may read, and opening it here to reach
 * one module's files would publish all of it.
 *
 * The consequence is narrow and real: a deliverable whose material was UPLOADED
 * rather than linked has an address this app cannot resolve. So we do not print
 * it. The honest fix is for handover material — which is FOR the client by
 * definition — to be stored in the shared bucket like a ticket attachment
 * already is, and that is a change to the agency's upload door, not to this
 * screen. Until then the card is complete and truthful about what it can offer.
 *
 * A relative path is the only shape that can be ours; an absolute link belongs to
 * somebody else's host and is theirs to serve. */
