"use client"

// WHAT YOU'VE SENT US — the to-dos this company has already completed, and the
// documents they attached to them.
//
// THE OWNER RULED ON THIS DIRECTLY ("yes they can see it ofc!"), and the bug
// underneath it was worse than a missing screen. `completeTodo` writes
// `file_url` and `completed_at` in the SAME UPDATE, so a to-do carries a
// client's document if and only if it is completed — and every to-do list on
// both front doors filtered the completed out. A contact pressed "Send a file",
// the bytes went into the bucket, the row was correct, and the item vanished
// from the only screen that had ever shown it. The last time they saw the
// contract they had just sent us was the moment before they sent it.
//
// It renders NOTHING when the pile is genuinely empty, exactly as "Awaiting your
// input" above it does, and for the same reason: most people will land here
// with nothing in it, and a card congratulating them on that is a card they
// learn to scroll past. Loading and error are answered FIRST, though — a
// screen that checked emptiness before either read "nothing sent" while the
// fetch was still in flight, and forever if it failed.
//
// THE FILE IS THEIRS AND THE FENCE ALREADY PERMITS IT. `postCompleteTodo` writes
// to `env.MEDIA` — the shared bucket this gateway binds and serves at `/media/*`
// with the same key validation the agency door uses — not to the agency's own
// `/media/internal/`. So reading it back is the account fence answering yes, not
// a hole being opened.
