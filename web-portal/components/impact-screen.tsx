"use client"

// WHAT THIS HAS BEEN WORTH — the client's own side of the savings figure.
//
// It is the same arithmetic the agency sees, drilled the same way (App →
// Process → Step), because it has to be: a client who asks "where does 208
// hours come from?" and gets a different answer from the one their account
// manager has is a client who stops believing both.
//
// THREE THINGS ARE DELIBERATE HERE.
//
// 1. THE CAPTION SHIPS WITH THE NUMBER (R25), word for word, from the one
//    constant beside the arithmetic. The times are estimates we agreed with
//    them; the subtraction is arithmetic. A client who understands that trusts
//    the figure. One who believes we held a stopwatch stops trusting every other
//    number in the app the day one of them looks wrong.
//
// 2. A STEP THAT GOT SLOWER IS SHOWN, and it is counted. There is no filter on
//    this screen that drops one, and the totals never quietly lose one — the
//    rule was "build the attachment; do not build a filter that hides them". So
//    a regression appears with our EXPLANATION beside it, and when we have not
//    written one yet it says so plainly rather than disappearing. Hiding it
//    would be the version of this screen that costs the most the first time
//    somebody notices.
//
// 3. PRICES ARE ABSENT UNLESS THEY WERE SENT. The per-account switch is decided
//    at the door: when it is off, the `prices` key is not in the response at
//    all. This screen has no flag of its own to get wrong — it renders what it
//    was given. And what it can never be given, under any setting, is the
//    agency's own margin or internal rates (R24).

//
// The local money copy left `minimumFractionDigits` off, so this screen rendered
// a round rate as "12.5" where the agency's own rate card, reading the SAME cents,
// rendered "12.50". A client and the person who set their price were looking at
// two spellings of one number. That is the exact divergence the shared file was

// reason for a second one to exist.

/** THE PICTURE, FETCHED AFTER THE FIGURE IT ILLUSTRATES.
 *
 * The headline of this screen is a number and the sentence that makes it honest
 * (R25), and Recharts is ~112 kB. Behind a static import, a client on a phone
 * would wait on a charting library before being told what their figure is made
 * of. Behind this one, the number and its caption paint immediately and the
 * picture arrives underneath. `ssr: false` because a static export has no server
 * to render it on; the placeholder holds the chart's own height so the accordion
 * below it does not jump when the chunk lands. */

 * and — when a step got slower — a sentence of explanation, all on one line.
 * That made it the densest band in the client portal, on the screen a client is
 * most likely to turn round and show somebody else (N1 caps a band at four).
 *
 * Now: the NAME is the title. The two times are ONE unit, an arrow between them,
 * because "twelve minutes became four" is one fact a reader decodes in one go
 * and not two facts to be compared. How often it runs is the second. The HOURS
 * SAVED is the trailing number, because it is the point of the line. And the
 * regression sentence drops to a line of its OWN underneath — a sentence is
 * never a unit on a band beside numbers (N4: one band, one question).
