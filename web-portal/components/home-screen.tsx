"use client"

// HOME — the client's world at a glance, in the order they'd ask about it.
//
// Every dashboard is a series of decisions about what someone cares about most.
// Here it is: am I waiting on anything, what is this worth, and how do I ask for
// something? So the screen is a greeting, the one thing outstanding, the one
// number, the one action, the newest few tickets, and a way to the rest.
//
// THERE IS STILL NO "RECENT ACTIVITY" FEED, and that half of the original
// decision has not moved: a feed of internal history would name the staff moving
// the work, which the portal never does (SCOPE ch.06).
//
// WHAT DID MOVE, 18 Aug 2026: this screen used to carry no metric tile either,
// on the same line of reasoning. That was the wrong scope for it. "How much time
// is this giving my team back" is not internal history — it is the client's own
// number, computed from estimates they agreed to, and it is the question the
// whole product exists to answer. So it is here, at a glance, WITH the sentence
// that says what it is made of (R25) and a way through to the arithmetic behind
// it. It renders nothing at all until a process has actually been mapped.
//
// The empty state matters more than the full one: most clients will land here
// with nothing outstanding, and "nothing outstanding" should read as good news,
// not as an app that failed to load.
