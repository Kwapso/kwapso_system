"use client"

// ONE REQUEST — what you asked, where it stands, and the conversation.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS SCREEN DELIBERATELY DOES NOT HAVE, both worth stating because
// both look like omissions until you know why:
//
// 1. NO ACTIVITY TAB. Every record detail in the base carries Overview +
//    Activity (R2). A record's history is a list of sentences like "Alaap moved
//    this to in progress" — it NAMES the staff moving the work, which the portal
//    never does (SCOPE ch.06). The activity door isn't on the portal gateway's
//    surface either, so this isn't a hidden button; it is a door that was never
//    opened. Recorded as a reasoned exemption in shared/rules/registry.ts
//    (PORTAL_ACTIVITY_EXEMPT) and held true by the portal's rules test — an
//    exemption nobody checks is just a skip with better manners.
//
// 2. NO STATUS CONTROL — WITH EXACTLY ONE EXCEPTION, and the exception is the
//    reason this paragraph is worth reading. Moving a ticket along its lifecycle
//    is gated on help:edit, which is the agency's job: the client sees where it
//    stands (CHECKLIST 5.2 — the status is a label, never a button). The one
//    move a client makes is the FIRST one: an extra, a request or a piece of
//    feedback waits in `awaiting_validation` until the company paying for it says
//    it wants it (CHECKLIST 5.13). That is the "yes, go ahead" band below, and it
//    is the only lifecycle control on this surface. It is narrow at the DOOR
//    rather than by this screen being careful: the account fence rides the
//    UPDATE, and R17's predicate means the only transition it can make is
//    awaiting_validation → new. It cannot reopen, resolve, or move a started
//    request, whatever this component sends it.
//
// THE ONE PIECE OF REAL LOGIC: who wrote a reply. A thread now has three kinds
// of author, not two — since the owner ruled that a contact sees their COMPANY's
// questions (11 Aug 2026), the people on a thread are this person, their
// COLLEAGUES, and the agency.
//
// The server decides which is which, because only the server knows: it sends a
// name for everyone on the client's side of the fence and NO name for anyone on
// ours (lib/help listReplies). So the rule here is simply "you, or the name we
// were given, or us" — and the staff-anonymity rule (SCOPE ch.06) is kept by the
// wire rather than by this component choosing not to draw something it was sent.
// Which matters: the old version printed the agency's name for every author who
// wasn't you, and would have introduced a client's own colleague as "kwapso".
//
// THE THREAD IS THE KIT'S, AND THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO SAY IT COULD NOT BE.
//
// The old note here explained that the conversation was hand-assembled because
// "no component in the library can express [WhatsApp-style sides] on a NAMED
// thread" — TicketThread had no per-reply side, and Chat had sides but no
// author. Both were true of the OLD library. The kit ships
// `structures/portal-conversation`, whose `ThreadMessage` carries `side`,
// `author`, `authorMeta`, `time` and `attachments`, and which is drawn for
// exactly this screen: "the client's thread on a record". The note outlived the
// thing it described by one design system, which is how a hand-rolled copy
// becomes permanent.
//
// So the bubbles, their sides, the 62% measure, the author headings, the
// loading/empty/error registers and the internal-note PROHIBITION (ch27.10 —
// a message marked internal is dropped before the thread sees it, which is a
// safety property this screen should never have been carrying itself) are the
// kit's now.
//
// TWO PARTS ARE STILL COMPOSED HERE, both deliberately:
//   • THE COMPOSER. The kit's is a single-line pill (`<input type="text">`),
//     which is right for a chat and wrong for a client describing what went
//     wrong with their work. `composer={false}`, and the paragraph field below
//     stays — built from the kit's own Card, Textarea and Button, so it is the
//     kit's vocabulary either way.
//   • THE APPROVAL BAND. `PortalApprovalBand` is exported on its own and is
//     used, so the band is the kit's DRAWING — but it stays where this screen
//     puts it (under the description, see the note there) rather than where the
//     shape would put it (above the composer, at the bottom). A person is asked
//     to approve a request after they have read it back, not before.

/** WHICH SIDE A MESSAGE SITS ON — and why it is this way round.
 *
 * The owner asked to "show a clear distinction between chats sent by the current
 * active user and chats sent by another user… similar to WhatsApp". He typed
 * "ours on the left, theirs on the right" — but WhatsApp, the app he NAMED, puts
 * YOUR OWN messages on the RIGHT. This builds the convention he named rather
 * than the direction he typed. That is a decision, not a slip: to flip it, swap
 * these two values and change nothing else.
 *
 * It is also deliberately BINARY, and that is a security property, not tidiness.
 * The only question it asks is "did I write this". It must never key on the
 * author id for anything more — no per-author grouping, no per-author colour, no
 * collapsing consecutive messages by author — because two replies typed by two
 * different staff members have to be indistinguishable. The moment the unnamed
 * side splits into groups, it stops being "the agency" and starts being a
 * fingerprint you can count people with (SCOPE ch.06).
 *
 * The wire already holds that line: to a client login a reply from our side of
 * the fence arrives with authorId AND authorName null (shared/types HelpMessage
 * says why). So `null === me` is false and every agency reply lands on the same
 * side by the same route — this function must never become the second place that
 * decision is made. */
