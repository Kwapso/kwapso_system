"use client"

// MY COMPANY — the record we hold for them, and the people in it.
//
// This is the one screen where "account" appears as a concept, and the one where
// the iron rule is easiest to break: ACCOUNT NEVER MEANS A LOGIN (SCOPE ch.02).
// So the heading is "Your details", the people are CONTACTS, and the word
// "account" is not used for a person's ability to sign in anywhere on this page.
// Portal access is not shown at all — who can sign in is a staff decision, and
// showing it here would invite exactly the confusion the rule exists to prevent.
//
// Everything comes from ONE fenced door (`/api/tenancy/accounts/detail`), read
// with the id the server itself handed us in the portal context. The portal
// never composes an account id, never reads one from the URL, and never asks for
// one it wasn't given — the fence would refuse it anyway, with the same 404 a
// made-up id gets, but not asking is the cheaper guarantee.
