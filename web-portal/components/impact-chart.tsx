"use client"

// THE SAVINGS, SEEN AT ONCE — the only file in the portal that touches the
// library's Chart, and the only reason it is a file of its own.
//
// The Value screen's headline is a NUMBER and the sentence that makes it honest
// (R25). Recharts is ~112 kB, and importing it into that screen puts it in front
// of both: a client on a phone would wait on a charting library to be told what
// the figure is made of. So the picture is behind a `dynamic()` in impact-screen,
// and every static reference to the library module lives in here — the same
// split, and the same reasoning, as web/components/screens/pulse-charts.tsx.
// (Neither front door imports the other's; the two share `shared/` and nothing
// else, which is why this is a second small file rather than one shared one.)
//
// It is PRESENTATIONAL: rows already shaped, no fetch, no fence. Whether to draw
// it at all — one app is the headline figure drawn twice — is decided before
// this file is ever asked for.
