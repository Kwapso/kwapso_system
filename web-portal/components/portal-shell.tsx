"use client"

// THE PORTAL SHELL — the frame every signed-in screen sits in, and the one place
// the five session states are turned into something to look at.
//
// It is not the agency AppShell with items removed. The agency shell carries a
// team switcher, a module sidebar built from a permission-filtered page
// registry, a section nav with count badges, an assistant launcher and a profile
// menu, because staff live in it. This shell has a short list of destinations, a
// name, and a way out. The shortness is the whole point: a person who has never
// used software like this should be able to hold the whole app in their head.
// The list is DESTINATIONS below, which says what each one had to earn to be on
// it — it has grown twice and it is nearly full.
//
// It also owns the live link. One socket on the team channel; every ping goes
// through the portal's own listener registry (lib/live-resources), which knows
// which of the client's screens each resource touches and ignores the rest.

 * question the whole engagement is judged on. It sits before "My company" for
 * the same reason: what the work is worth is read far more often than an address.
 *
 * DELIVERABLES IS THE FIFTH, and it is the only one of the five that is a place
 * to GO AND FETCH something rather than a thing to read. It sits after Value and
 * before "My company" because that is the order of how often they are wanted: the
 * saving, then the material, then the address. It is deliberately not folded into
 * Home — a client looking for the SOP we wrote them in March is on a errand, and

       * loses the end of a word in German and Catalan, which is the shape of
       * bug nobody reports because nobody sees it happen.

/** The signed-out frame — the sign-in door and nothing else. Exported so /login
 * and the shell agree on what "not yet" looks like.
 *
 * THE ARRANGEMENT IS composition ch27.16 exactly: "photography left, one
 * column of content right … with the isotype sitting directly above the
 * title where an eyebrow would otherwise go". Drawn by hand rather than as
 * `<AuthShell>{children}</AuthShell>` because `AuthShell`
 * (`compositions/screens/sign-in.tsx`) has no `children` slot of its own —
 * its body is one of the four fixed registers ch27.17-19 draw (link sent,
 * invite, session expired), and this door's body is a form none of those are
 * — see COMPOSITION-MISMATCHES.md's `screens/sign-in.tsx` entry.
 *
 * THE MARK AND THE PHOTOGRAPH ARE THE KIT'S OWN COMPONENTS, as of 2026-08-29.
 * They used to be a hand-drawn stand-in (`auth-artwork.tsx`, now deleted)
 * because `compositions/templates/sign-in.tsx`'s `AuthPhotograph` hands a
 * static image import straight to `<Image>`'s `src`, and Vite (the kit's own
 * bundler) resolves that to a URL string while Next resolves it to a
 * `StaticImageData` object — `npx tsc --noEmit -p web-portal` used to stop on
 * `templates/sign-in.tsx(208,7): Type 'StaticImageData' is not assignable to
 * type 'string | Blob'`. Fixed upstream in `lib/asset-url.ts` (kit v1.2.4+,
 * UI-GAPS.md row 23); verified here by a throwaway probe import under this
 * app's own `tsc` before wiring it back in, not by the tag number alone.
 * `Logotype`'s `size="lg"` is the same slot `auth-artwork.tsx`'s hand-drawn
 * mark used — ch27.16's own words, "exactly as tall as the one mango
 * Continue further down the same column" — and `on="paper"` swaps cut
 * automatically the same way the old two-`<img>` shim did, just from the
 * kit's own token rule instead of a hand-copied one.
 *
 * THE PHOTOGRAPH ITSELF DID NOT CHANGE. `AuthPhotograph` here and the deleted
 * shim both load the identical file, `assets/photography/exterior-mockup-
 * *.jpg` — the client's own placeholder, by their own words on 2026-08-24
 * ("we will replace it later, but so far for the external screens image use
 * the attached, the phone mockup"), not a generic kit stock photo. Swapping
 * to the kit's component changes nothing a client sees.
 *
 * THERE IS NO THEME CONTROL HERE ANY MORE, and that is the point rather than a
 * removal. A `ModeToggle` used to sit pinned in the top corner of the one
 * screen a client meets before they are anyone — a three-way choice about a
 * preference, in front of somebody who has not yet said who they are, on a page
 * whose whole job is one field and one button. Appearance now follows the
 * reader's own machine, through the token overrides that already do exactly
 * that: `tokens.css` reads `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` on
 * `:root:not([data-theme="light"])`, which is the state where no attribute has
 * been written — and no attribute is what a person who has never chosen has.
 * Nothing here writes one. A client who HAS chosen inside the app keeps their
 * choice (the boot script in `shared/web/theme-provider.tsx` applies it before
 * first paint, on this screen as on every other), and the place to change it
 * stays where a preference belongs: the header of the signed-in app. */

          agency has no photography and collapses to one full-width column
          (`web/components/shell/auth-card.tsx` has the same note). THIS door keeps
          its two panels and its real, client-supplied photograph
          (`AuthPhotograph`, see the header comment above) — there is nothing
          empty here to react to. So only the half of the ruling that still

          desktop), and is a no-op everywhere it already fills the column (a
