"use client"

// WAITING ON YOU — the to-dos we have asked this company for, and the two things
// a contact does about one: mark it done, and send the file we asked for
// (SCOPE ch.06, two of the six things a contact can do).
//
// IT SITS ON HOME, above their own requests, and the order is the argument. The
// first question a client's screen should answer is "is anyone waiting on ME",
// because that is the one they can do something about in the next minute. Their
// own tickets are the second question: those are waiting on us.
//
// WHEN THE LIST IS GENUINELY EMPTY, it renders NOTHING — not an empty card
// saying "no outstanding items". Most people will land here with nothing
// outstanding, and a panel congratulating them on it is a panel they learn to
// scroll past, which is how the day it DOES have something in it gets missed.
//
// BUT THAT IS ONLY TRUE ONCE THE ANSWER IS IN. This used to check emptiness
// before loading or error at all, so a client with real outstanding items saw
// nothing for the length of the request — indistinguishable from "you're all
// caught up" — and forever if the fetch failed. Loading and error are handled
// first now, and each says its own honest thing before the empty case ever
// gets asked.
