"use client"

// WHAT A CLIENT MAY DO WITH A FILE ON THEIR TICKET: attach one, read their own
// back, and take their own off. NOT rename or replace one the agency attached —
// owner's ruling, 27 Aug 2026, answered "never" when asked. The reasoning and
// the fence that would have to carry it live where the mistake would be made:
// `web/components/help-attachments.tsx`'s header and the door in
// `workers/content/src/routes/help.ts`.

// FILES AND LINKS ON ONE TICKET (CHECKLIST 5.10) — "show us what you mean".
//
// A screenshot of the thing that is wrong is the client's half of a support
// conversation, and until this shipped they had no way to send one: the ticket
// screen had a description box, a thread, and nowhere to put a picture. So the
// section does three things and no more — read what is on the ticket, add a file,
// add a link — plus taking one back off, because the first thing anybody does
// with an upload button is attach the wrong file.
//
// BOTH SIDES' MATERIAL, ONE LIST. We attach things too (a mock-up, a recording of
// the fix), and the door answers with all of it. Whose it is follows the same
// rule the thread's authors do: the SERVER sends a name for everyone on the
// client's side of the fence and NO name for anyone on ours, so "you, your
// colleague, or kwapso" is decided by the wire and this component never chooses
// what to draw (SCOPE ch.06).
//
// THE UPLOAD IS THE TO-DO'S UPLOAD. Hidden <input type="file"> driven by the
// button beside it → readFileAsDataUrl → one api call. Same seam, same 10 MB
// pre-check, same shape as waiting-on-you.tsx, because "send us the file" is one
// act and a client should not meet two versions of it.
//
// R14: the door caps the list at TICKET_ATTACHMENT_CAP and this renders what it
// was handed — there is no page two to walk, and the WRITE refuses past the same
// ceiling, so a full list is a refusal with a sentence rather than a silent drop.
// R16: the count is the door's exact COUNT(*), rendered once, through the portal's
// one CollectionHeading.
// R21: nothing here moves a ticket along its lifecycle. Attaching is gated on
// help:read — the right that lets a person see the ticket at all — and the
// account fence decides whose ticket it is, at the door.
