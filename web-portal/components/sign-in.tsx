"use client"

// SIGN IN — an email address and a six-digit code, or Google, and nothing else
// on screen.
//
// This file is the portal door's CHROME. The behaviour behind it — email → code
// → signed in, and the rule that a cooldown moves you ON rather than stranding
// you — lives once, in shared/web/use-email-sign-in.ts, which the agency app's
// own sign-in screen renders too. It used to live here as well, in a second
// copy, and a bug had to be fixed in both on the same day.
//
// SIGNING IN IS NOT GETTING IN. Invite-only is absolute (SCOPE ch.06): a correct
// code proves who you are, it does not create access. So a stranger who signs in
// successfully lands on the "nothing here yet" screen rather than a new empty
// world of their own — and this component says nothing that promises otherwise.
//
// GOOGLE IS THE SECOND WAY TO PROVE THE SAME THING, not a second account: the
// verified Google address goes through the one identity seam the code path uses
// (findOrCreateUserByEmail), so the person who used a code last week and Google
// today is one row. It creates access no more than the code does — SCOPE ch.06
// is explicit: "signing in with Google never creates access; the invite does."
// The wording of a failure and the brand mark are shared with the agency door
// (shared/web/google-sign-in.tsx) so the two can't drift apart.
