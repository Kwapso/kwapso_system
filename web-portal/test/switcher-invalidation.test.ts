// SWITCHING COMPANY MUST SWITCH THE SCREEN, NOT JUST THE SERVER.

// `POST /api/tenancy/portal/switch-account` moves where the person stands and
// answers with the new context. The screen, though, reads that context from
// cache — so if the switch does not drop `portal:context`, the server moves and
// the screen does not. The header keeps the old company's name, the tick in
// this menu stays on the old row, and the tickets underneath quietly become the
// NEW company's. A client looking at one company's name above another
// company's work is the exact confusion the one-at-a-time rule exists to
// prevent, and it looks like a leak even though nothing leaked.
//
// Caught by switching in the deployed portal and watching the name not change.
//
// This reads the source because the bug is an omission — a missing line. A
// render test would need the whole cache layer stood up to observe a cache key
// that was never touched, and would pass just as happily on a component that
// invalidated nothing at all.
