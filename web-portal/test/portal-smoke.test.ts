// THE PORTAL SMOKE, CHECKED BEFORE IT RUNS.
//
// `scripts/smoke-portal.mjs` proves the client's front door against live
// staging: every door on the allow-list answers, the account fence holds, a
// withdrawn deliverable takes its file URL with it, and no door reading the
// agency's own cost is reachable at the client's hostname. All of that is
// worth much more than this file — and none of it runs until somebody deploys.
//
// WHICH IS THE GAP THIS CLOSES. A smoke script is the one kind of test that can
// rot silently in both directions: a door added to `PORTAL_DOORS` today is
// simply never knocked on, and a path the script names with a typo is a check
// that passes against nothing. The run itself catches the first (its census is
// derived from what it actually called) and cannot catch the second in the way
// that matters — a mistyped path 404s, and a 404 is what half of these checks
// are LOOKING for. So the spelling is checked here, at `npm run check`, where a
// developer finds out in fifteen seconds rather than after a deploy.
//
// THREE THINGS, and each of them is a way the smoke could go quietly useless:
//
//   1. It is WIRED — `deploy:staging` runs it. A smoke nobody runs is a file.
//   2. Every door path it names is a real entry in the gateway's own table, and
//      every listener the portal registers has a door named for it, in both
//      directions. That map lives in the script (it is a judgement about which
//      read refills which cache key); this makes it a judgement the build reads.
//   3. It still names the things the two bugs of 2026-08-19 were about — the
//      per-row deliverable visibility and R24's internal money. A check whose
//      subject quietly leaves the file is the shape every law here was earned
//      on twice.
//
// It does NOT re-derive the internal-money doors or the fence: those are R24's
// and the portal-fence suite's jobs, and asserting them a third time here would
// be a third place to update. This file only guards the SMOKE.
