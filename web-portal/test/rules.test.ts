// THE LAWS OF THE BASE, ON THE SECOND FRONT DOOR.
//
// web/test/rules.test.ts scans `web/components`. Every UI law in the base is
// therefore enforced on exactly one surface — and the day a second front door
// shipped, every one of them silently stopped covering half the app. That is not
// a law being broken; it is a law quietly ceasing to apply, which is worse,
// because nothing goes red.
//
// So the portal enforces the same laws over its own source: R3 (no hand-rolled
// toggles), R4 (forms through the ONE FormShell), R7 (drafts survive), R16 (an
// exact server count, in one place, through the one seam), plus the two rules
// this surface adds — the reasoned R2 exemption, and staff anonymity.
//
// The "ONE" in those laws now means shared/web/ — the browser half of the same
// shared/ the workers already use. It used to mean web/, reached through an
// alias into the sibling app's tree, which made the portal compile out of source
// it never declared a dependency on (and one of those files says, in its own
// header, that it gets deleted the day the library ships a replacement). The
// last describe below is what keeps that door shut.
