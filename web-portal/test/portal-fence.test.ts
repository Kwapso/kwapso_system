// THE FENCE GUARD — at last, a check for PORTAL_VISIBLE_READS.
//
// That list sat in shared/rules/registry.ts as data with NO test reading it, for
// its whole first life. Its own doc-comment promised "a file that reads one of
// these tables and is in neither state turns the build red", and nothing turned
// red, ever. This suite is that promise, kept — and it is deliberately built to
// catch the class of miss that produced it.
//
// THREE DESIGN CHOICES DO THE WORK:
//
// 1. THE TARGET SET IS DERIVED FROM THE PORTAL'S OWN DOOR TABLE. The registry's
//    comment says the lesson was "enumerate by WHAT A CLIENT CAN REACH, never by
//    what the account module happens to own" — but until this door existed there
//    was no machine-readable answer to "what can a client reach". Now there is:
//    workers/portal-gateway/src/index.ts. Every door named there is walked
//    through to the worker's ROUTES table, to the handler, to the lib functions
//    the handler calls. Open a door tomorrow and its fence is demanded today.
//
// 2. IT CHECKS FUNCTIONS, NOT FILES. The registry keys are files, and a
//    file-level check is exactly what let `help.ts` sit here declaring
//    `authorScope` while two of its exported readers — the ticket THREAD —
//    carried no fence at all. The leak was one function along from the entry
//    that claimed to cover it. So each reachable function must itself touch the
//    caller's stamp: its own declared fence, or the AccountScope it was handed.
//
// 3. A READ IS A READ WHATEVER VERB IT WEARS. This suite used to walk GET doors
//    only — `if (!door.startsWith("GET "))` — and that is precisely why it sat
//    green over the third leak: `POST /api/content/help` RAISES a ticket and
//    ANSWERS WITH THE LIST, so a client's first question came back carrying
//    every other client's tickets. It was never a GET, so it was never a target.
//    Now every portal door is walked, GET and POST, and the discriminator is
//    what the code DOES, not what the verb says: a reachable function that
//    SELECTs rows must be declared and must carry the fence; one that only
//    writes is a write (it stamps the caller's own row and has no list to leak).
//    Reachability follows route-LOCAL helpers too — the leak lived inside
//    `ticketPage`, a page builder the handler called, invisible to a walk that
//    stopped at exported names.
//
// It cannot prove a fence is CORRECT — that is what the burglar suite in
// workers/tenancy/test/account-leak.test.ts is for. It proves no portal-reachable
// read is built without one, which is the failure that has now happened three times.
