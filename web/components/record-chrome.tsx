// RECORD CHROME — the four pieces every record detail wears, in one file.
//
// UI-RULEBOOK D1 says a detail screen has exactly four regions in one order:
// the header band, the tab strip, the tab panel, and the audit footer at the
// foot of the panel. Ten detail components each drew their own version of the
// first and none drew the last, which is how the same record type ended up with
// six buttons on one screen and a two-line title on another.
//
//   RecordActionsMenu — the three-dot overflow (B1/B2). Net-new: `DotsThree`
//                       appeared ZERO times in this repo before 17 Aug 2026, so
//                       every action a record had was a visible button.
//   RecordHeader      — the header band (D2). Transparent, so the ambient field
//                       shows HERE and nowhere else (C4).
//   RecordBody        — everything from the tab strip down, on opaque paper, with
//                       the tab strip pinned under a collapsed title line (D3).
//   RecordScreen's `audit`/`activity` — created-by / last-edited-by and the
//                       recent-activity summary, D7, now drawn by the KIT's
//                       own ink footer card instead of a hand-rolled grey one
//                       (see "the footer" section below, fixed 2026-08-31).
//
// The two sticky layers do not fight: the shell owns z-20 (L6) and everything
// here takes z-10, so the phone's app bar still passes over both.
//
// THEY PIN TO THE CARD'S BODY NOW, NOT TO THE WINDOW (kit v1.2.28, 2026-09-02).
// `ScreenShell` draws the page `h-dvh overflow-hidden` and makes the card's
// body its one scroller, so `top-0` here is the top of the PANE — which is
// below the phone's app bar already, and below the breadcrumb strip and the
// header band on every width. That is why nothing in this file offsets itself
// by `--shell-top` any more: the offset existed because the document was the
// scroller and the bar floated over its top edge, and neither half of that
// sentence is true. `--shell-top` is still published by app-shell and is now
// read by exactly one thing, the shell's own inset for that bar.

/* -------------------------- the record tab strip --------------------------
   SUPERSEDED, v1.2.28 — the ruling this constant was built to enforce no
   longer has an opposite to enforce against. Client ruling, 2026-08-31,
   verbatim, kept for the record: "Detail screens are using the folder-tab
   design, but that style belongs to main screens only. Detail screens should
   use the line (underline) tabs." Concrete case: the App detail screen
   (Overview / Sprints / Stories / Stakeholders) was drawing folder tabs,
   because every detail screen's own `TabsView` config spread
   `defaultTabsConfig` (tabs-view.tsx) with no `variant` override, and that
   default was `"folder"` then — correct for a COLLECTION's own strip, wrong
   for a RECORD's own top-level strip. ONE constant, spread by every record's
   own tabsConfig, was the fix — not a per-file `variant: "line"` written
   twelve times, which is how the folder default drifted onto every one of
   them in the first place.

   The kit killed the folder shape entirely on 2026-09-02 (tabs-view.tsx's own
   header has the client's words), so `defaultTabsConfig` is `"line"` now too
   — there is no longer a wrong default to escape, and this constant is
   therefore identical to `defaultTabsConfig` by value. It stays as its own
   name rather than being deleted in favour of the shared one: fourteen detail
   screens already import it BY NAME as "the record's own tab config," which
   is a real distinction even though the two constants currently agree — a
   future main-screen ruling that changes `defaultTabsConfig` again should not
   have to hunt down twelve detail screens that were quietly relying on the
   collection default matching the record one by coincidence. */

/* ------------------------------- the footer -------------------------------
   FIXED 2026-08-31. This used to draw its OWN grey `<footer>` box, hand-rolled,
   below the tab panel — the client's own words, comparing a live record
   against the kit's mockup: "the footer of detail page is completely
   different than in the design." It was: a flat grey strip inside the panel,
   never the kit's ch27.8 charcoal two-column card (`RecordDetail`'s region 4,
   `Latest activity` / `Record`), because this file predates that card and was
   never rebuilt onto it.

   `RecordChrome`'s `footerVisible={false}` (below, on `RecordScreen`) is what
   this app used to say instead of drawing the kit's ink card at all — it was
   right, not because the card was rejected, but because nothing here fed it
   yet. It is fixed by feeding it, not by turning it back on with nothing
   behind it: `audit` and `activity` — the same data this app already had for
   the OLD grey footer and the existing Activity tab, respectively — now go
   straight into the kit's `audit` / `activity` props on `RecordChrome`
   (record-chrome.tsx §"the ink footer"), and `footerVisible` is left to the
   kit's own default (true; `RecordDetail` shows the card only when one of the
   two columns actually has something to draw).

   THE DATE NOW RIDES THE LABEL SLOT, RIGHT-ALIGNED — CLIENT RULING, 2026-08-31,
   verbatim: "on the footer, on the record section also have the dates aligned
   right", pointing at Latest activity's own trailing time column beside it.
   `RecordDetailAuditEntry.label` is not new (record-detail.tsx already draws
   it at the row's inline start with `children` pushed to the inline end via
   `justify-between` — the same trailing-edge idea `ActivityFeed`'s own time
   column uses, there via a trailing `auto` grid track rather than a flex
   `justify-between`, but the same result: the date sits flush at the row's
   end), it was simply unfed here. So when BOTH a name and a
   date are known, `label` takes "Created by {name}" / "Last edited by {name}"
   and `children` takes the bare `formatRelative` value, which lands it hard
   right the same way the Latest activity column's timestamps already sit.
   NO NEW CATALOGUE STRING: "Created by {name}" and "Last edited by {name}"
   already exist (the name-only fallback below has always called them), so
   this reuses them rather than inventing a fourth. The middot-joined
   "Created by {name} · {when}" sentence retires — checked against every
   configured language (`shared/i18n-seed.ts`: de/es/ca all keep {name} before
   {when} in that exact order, none reorders across the middot), so splitting
   the join into two DOM nodes at the same seam changes no language's reading,
   it only lets the second half sit at the row's own end instead of inline.
   The name-only and date-only fallbacks (no `label`) are untouched: with only
   one fact to show, there is nothing to put on a second column and the old
   single-phrase reading is exactly right there. Run `npm run lang` after this
   change — it prunes the two now-orphaned join sentences from the catalogue,
   per R28. */

/* --------------------- the door on the Latest activity row -----------------
   THE SUMMARY ABOVE IS NOW THE ONLY ACTIVITY ON A RECORD PAGE, so the way to

   verbatim: "On the right column, on Latest Activity, I would like some view
   or expand or whatever, and this would open a slide-in with all the
   activity." 2026-09-07: "implemet 'A · in the eyebrow row' across the app."
   The rail itself — the link, the count and the `EdgePanel` behind them — is
   `web/components/activity-rail.tsx`, drawn once for all thirteen bespoke
   details by the single call below.

   AND IT RIDES `activityLabel` BECAUSE THE KIT'S OWN TEMPLATE DROPS THE REAL
   SLOT. This is a logged gap, not a preference. `RecordDetail` (the vendored
   primitive, shared/ui/components/record-detail/record-detail.tsx) grew
   `activityAction` on 2026-09-07 for exactly this door: a trailing node on the
   eyebrow's own line, `items-baseline`, at a derived leading so it costs no
   vertical space. But this file does not reach `RecordDetail` — it goes
   through `RecordChrome`, the kit's own composition template
   (shared/ui/compositions/templates/record-chrome.tsx), and that file forwards
   twenty-odd props into `RecordDetail` and `activityAction` is not one of
   them. `shared/ui/` is vendored and pinned (CLAUDE.md, `vendored-kit.test.ts`
   recomputes its content hash), so the template cannot be hand-edited here;
   the fix belongs upstream in Kwapso/kwapso-ui-ux, and it is one line in that
   file's prop list and one in its render. THE RECIPE PATH ALREADY USES THE
   REAL PROP (shared/web/screen-engine/screen-renderer.tsx renders
   `RecordDetail` directly), so the two halves of this app prove the slot works
   and prove the template is what is missing.

   WHAT THE STAND-IN COSTS, EXACTLY. `RecordChrome` DOES forward
   `activityLabel`, and it is a `ReactNode`, so the whole row can be built here
   and handed over as the label. The kit puts its action BESIDE
   `RecordFooterEyebrow`; this puts the row INSIDE it — and that one span is
   `text-micro font-[var(--font-weight-medium)] uppercase text-ink-tertiary`,
   every one of which inherits. So the action carries three resets the kit's
   own version does not need (`normal-case`, `tracking-normal`, and the ink),
   and `ActivityRail`'s own control carries the other three on the button
   itself (see its comment: `Button` would otherwise impose `text-sm`,
   `leading-none` and the medium weight). Everything else is copied off
   `record-detail.tsx` verbatim rather than re-derived: the flex row's
   `items-baseline justify-between gap-[var(--space-3)]`, the
   `--footer-eyebrow-line` declaration (`--text-micro × --text-micro--line-
   height` = 13.406px at the shipped root, so the two boxes are identical and
   the row's height is the height the lone eyebrow already had), and
   `flex-none whitespace-nowrap` on the action so the LABEL wraps first and the
   door never does. The day the template grows the prop, this whole function is
   deleted and replaced by `activityAction={<ActivityRail …/>}`, with no visual
   difference — which is the same shape of swap this file already documented
   for `eyebrow`, and the reason it is written to be measured rather than eyed.

   IT ALSO TRANSLATES THE EYEBROW, WHICH NOTHING DID BEFORE. `activityLabel`
   was never passed, so the column's heading fell through to `RecordDetail`'s
   own hardcoded English "Latest activity" — a word the translation walk cannot
   see, because it never opens `shared/ui/` (R28, `VENDORED_UI`). Passing the
   label at all is forced by the row above; passing it through `t` is what
   stops a German reader being told "Latest activity" in English over three
   German sentences. */

  t: ReturnType<typeof useT>,

/** THE RECORD DETAIL SCREEN — the kit's shape, adapted to this app's call sites.

 * KIT-DRAWN, APP-FED. This file used to draw the four regions itself; the kit's

 * house pattern is `screen-engine/tabs-view.tsx`'s: keep the CONTRACT twelve call
 * sites already write, render every pixel through the kit.
 *
 * OVERRIDE 73 (2026-08-26) IS WHY THE PROPS CHANGED. The client, looking at the
 * live `Tickets · Padelbase · 4182` page, verbatim: "notice how the chips are
 * directly underneath the title … the edit button should be aligned with the
 * title and the chips underneath it. also, detail pages do not need this bar that
 * you have on top where we have Padelbase and the number. these are chips, so the
 * black chip is always the ID. we always use black chips for IDs, and next to it,
 * add a chip for Padelbase like in the example. of course, translate this to
 * universal rules."
 *
 * So `eyebrow` IS GONE — it was the dot-joined "Ticket · BERG-T0412 · Archived"
 * line above the title, and the ruling puts that material below it as chips. In
 * its place: `recordNumber` (the black `Badge variant="inverse"` — "the black chip
 * is always the ID"), `collectionLabel` (the chip beside it), and `chips` for
 * anything a screen adds. `actions` now shares the title's own row, which is what
 * puts Edit "aligned with the title" without a line of markup here.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WITH THE OLD HEADER. `RecordHeader`'s IntersectionObserver collapse
 * and `RecordBody`'s opaque-paper band are deleted rather than ported. The band
 * existed to stop the ambient field at the tab strip (UI-RULEBOOK C4) — and the
 * kit ships `AmbientBackground` with no translucency to stop, so the rule it
 * served no longer describes anything. The kit has final authority; C4 is one of
 * the rules that loses.
 *
 * THE TABS GO IN `panel`, NOT `tabs`. `RecordDetail` carries a tab strip of its
 * own and draws it only when `tabs` is non-empty (record-detail.tsx:681, :761), so
 * handing it our `children` as the panel gives exactly ONE strip — the app's
 * `TabsView`, which is kit-drawn throughout. Two strips on one screen is the
 * defect this lane exists to remove, not to move.
 *
 * THE EYEBROW COMES BACK, NARROWER — CLIENT RULING, 2026-08-31, REFINING
 * OVERRIDE 73 RATHER THAN REVERSING IT. Reviewing the live detail pages again,
 * verbatim: "in eyebrow what this is (f.e. App, Account, etc) - as it is right
 * now, the title - underneath the pills: the first one is always the id …". So
 * a bare eyebrow returns, but it is ONLY the record-TYPE word ("App",
 * "Account", "Ticket") — never the ID and never the status, which override 73
 * was right to put below as chips and stay there untouched.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS APP-SIDE AND NOT A NEW KIT PROP. `RecordDetail` (the vendored
 * primitive one layer down, shared/ui/components/record-detail/record-detail.tsx)
 * already has a real `eyebrow` slot and forwards it straight into `Title`
 * (shared/ui/components/title/title.tsx), which draws it exactly this way —
 * `text-micro` uppercase, `text-ink-tertiary`, sitting over the heading inside
 * the SAME block `actions` bottom-aligns against. But the kit's own `RecordChrome`
 * template (shared/ui/compositions/templates/record-chrome.tsx) is override 73's
 * own file and never forwards `eyebrow` into `RecordDetail` — the comment there
 * is explicit: "nothing here draws above `title` any more". `shared/ui/` is
 * vendored and pinned (CLAUDE.md, `web/test/vendored-kit.test.ts`), so that
 * template cannot be hand-edited here; the fix belongs upstream in
 * Kwapso/kwapso-ui-ux, logged as a gap (a real prop this template drops on the
 * floor). Until that lands, `title` itself carries the eyebrow, styled with the
 * exact three classes `Title` uses for its own — so the day the kit grows the
 * real slot, swapping this block for a plain `eyebrow` prop is a one-line change
 * with no visual difference. Nesting it inside `title` rather than drawing a
 * second node beside it is deliberate: `Title`'s row is `items-end`, so `actions`
 * bottom-aligns to whatever `title` renders as a whole, and stacking the eyebrow
 * above the real heading INSIDE one node is what keeps the buttons "aligned with
 * the title" (the client's own words, item 4 of this same ruling) rather than
 * with the eyebrow above it.
 *
 * THE EYEBROW LEAVES AGAIN, THIS TIME FOR GOOD, AND THE PILLS MOVE ABOVE THE
 * TITLE — CLIENT RULING, 2026-09-01, REVERSING BOTH OF THE ABOVE, against a
 * real screenshot of a live Ticket detail screen. New order for the FULL
 * (non-scrolled) header, top to bottom: the mark where the type has one, then
 * the pills row (black ID chip, status pill, parent-record chip), then the
 * title, then the subtitle where one exists — never an eyebrow, anywhere,
 * because the breadcrumb sitting above this whole header already names the
 * record type and the collection ("Tickets · Kids training missing from the
 * website menu"), which is what "THE EYEBROW COMES BACK" answered before a
 * breadcrumb existed to answer it instead. This paragraph originally went on
 * to say the condensed sticky bar (`condensed-title.tsx`, `CondensedTitleBar`)
 * "keeps BOTH the eyebrow and the pills" and disagrees with this header on
 * purpose — that was true for a few hours the same day and the two notes
 * below are what replaced it.
 *
 * THE MARK IS GONE FROM THIS HEADER TOO, AND FOR GOOD — CLIENT RULING,
 * 2026-09-01, LATER THE SAME DAY, OVERRIDING ANY EARLIER NUANCE, VERBATIM:
 * "for now there are no - under no case - images on title. remove it
 * everywhere." So "the mark where the type has one" a few lines up is no
 * longer this file's own behaviour: `mark`/`leading` still arrive on
 * `RecordScreen`'s own signature (every `*-detail.tsx` call site still passes
 * one) but neither is read into anything rendered near a title any more,
 * here or in the condensed bar — see the two props' own doc comments below
 * for why the signature keeps them anyway.
 *
 * AND THERE IS NO CONDENSED BAR TO DISAGREE WITH ANY MORE — CLIENT RULING,
 * 2026-09-03, verbatim: "when I scroll down, the whole compressed title is
 * useless, so remove that. When I scroll down, what is at the top should be
 * only the tabs, if there are tabs, on the same line as the whole eyebrow."
 * `condensed-title.tsx` is deleted: the smaller stand-in header that appeared
 * once this full one scrolled out of view, the `useIsVisible` trigger that
 * watched the title, and the measured `--record-tabs-top` clearance it
 * published for `STICKY_TABS` to sit under. `STICKY_TABS` now pins at `top-0`
 * — the strip and nothing above it. THIS IS WHAT KILLS THE `eyebrow` PROP
 * TOO: that bar was its one remaining reader (see the prop's own doc, below,
 * for the whole of why it had survived this file's own "no eyebrow, anywhere"
 * ruling), so it went with it, and with it the kit gap this file used to log
 * — `RecordChrome`'s dropped `eyebrow` slot is no longer a hole this app
 * needs filled, because this app no longer draws an eyebrow on either kind of
 * screen.
 *
 * MECHANICALLY: `eyebrow` is dropped from the node this file builds for the
 * kit's `title` slot (never rendered in the full header again), and the
 * identity row moves from being read alongside `title` at the same level
 * (override 73's own file, `RecordChrome`'s `chips` prop, which the kit
 * places in a `meta` region BELOW the title) to being the FIRST child inside
 * that same `title` node — the exact trick this file already used for the
 * eyebrow and still uses for the subtitle, because the kit's own template
 * cannot be hand-edited (R39) to swap which of its two regions comes first.
 * See `RecordScreen`'s own body — the comment above `identityChips` — for the
 * current mechanics in full.

/** A CHIP THAT NAVIGATES — the client's third pill, "the most relevant parent
 * container" (an app's account, a ticket's app, a story's sprint…): "when I
 * click it takes me to it." `Badge` already draws whatever node it is given
 * (it always has), so the chip itself needs no new shape — only a real in-app
 * link inside it, R37's `InAppLink` rather than a hand-rolled `onClick`, so the
 * chip is a genuine anchor (middle-click, copy-address, a screen reader) and
 * not a button pretending to be one.
 *
 * NO UNDERLINE, A HOVER COLOUR INSTEAD — client ruling, 2026-08-31, verbatim:
 * "on pills, when they have link, do not underline but give hover color." A
 * plain `Badge` (this one's default `variant="secondary"`) reads at
 * `text-ink-secondary`; `hover:text-foreground` steps it up to the full-strength
 * ink on touch, the same convention the app's other cross-reference links
 * already use for exactly this — `account-detail.tsx`'s "Part of {account}",
 * `sprint-detail.tsx`'s Wave field, `story-detail.tsx`'s App/Ticket links,
 * `contact-detail.tsx`'s company list — all `hover:text-foreground`, never an
 * underline. `InAppLink` carries no styling of its own, so that stayed the
 * only override on the link itself — but the ink step was the whole hover
 * treatment, and this is a PILL, not a text link: the fill never moved.
 *
 * THE FILL NOW MOVES TOO — bug fix, 2026-08-31, client: "the hover color
 * change [should be] applied to the PILL ITSELF (its background/fill), not
 * only to the text inside it." `has-[a:hover]:!bg-[var(--btn-secondary-hover)]`
 * on the `Badge` itself is the trigger (`:has()` reaches UP from the inner
 * `InAppLink` to this pill, the opposite direction `group`/`peer` reach).
 *
 * NOT `--accent` — MEASURED, not guessed. The kit's generic "neutral hover"
 * wash (`filter-bar.tsx`'s chip label uses it) is `rgba(…, .05)`, a 5% tint
 * meant to sit OVER an already-opaque backdrop (a popover, a card). This
 * badge's resting fill IS the backdrop — `bg-surface-quiet`, itself opaque —
 * so `background-color: var(--accent)` does not tint it, it REPLACES it,
 * and the 5% wash then composites against whatever is behind the badge
 * instead. Read live against this row's own transparent header band (dark
 * palette): resting `#3A3833` hovered to a computed `rgb(32, 31, 28)` —
 * DARKER than resting and barely off the near-black page underneath, i.e.
 * the pill nearly disappearing, the opposite of "a real, visible fill-color
 * shift." `--btn-secondary-hover` is the kit's other neutral-hover token —
 * OPAQUE, not alpha (`Button`'s own law: "hover is a named token, never an
 * opacity") — and lighter than `--surface-quiet` in both palettes (measured:
 * `#F1ECE4` over `#E2DDD4` light, `#454239` over `#3A3833` dark), so it reads
 * as a real brightening in both, regardless of what sits behind the pill.
 * Borrowed from `Button`, not invented: this badge's own variant is already
 * named `"secondary"`, and no `Badge`-specific hover token exists because
 * the kit's law is that a badge never hovers at all (this file's own note
 * two paragraphs up) — this is the one call site earning an exception to
 * that law, and it reaches for the nearest already-real neutral-hover token
 * rather than adding a new one to tokens.css for a single pill.
 *
 * THE RESTING COLOUR IS THE NAMED TOKEN, NOT A SWAP — client, 1 Sep 2026,
 * pointing at this exact pill a second time: "use this color #F7F2EB (the
 * main token for beige)" for the RESTING fill, unambiguously — the same
 * instruction that repointed every OTHER plain badge app-wide (`--surface-
 * panel`, `web/app/layout.tsx`'s `<body>` rule, above). An earlier pass here
 * read a prior "the two states are backwards" note as license to swap this
 * pill's two EXISTING tokens (`--btn-secondary-hover` / the quiet fallback)
 * between the resting and hover slots — which never lands on #F7F2EB at all,
 * on either state, because neither of those two tokens IS `--surface-panel`.
 * Measured: `--btn-secondary-hover` is `#F1ECE4`, `--surface-quiet` is
 * `#E2DDD4` (tokens.css) — the client's own quoted hex belongs to a THIRD
 * token, `--surface-panel`, that this pill had never actually drawn from.
 * So the fix reaches for that token by name rather than reshuffling the
 * other two: resting is `bg-surface-panel` — the identical class every other
 * plain badge in the app already carries after the layout-level repoint, so
 * this pill finally reads as the SAME beige, not a look-alike.
 *
 * THE HOVER STEP NEEDS REAL CONTRAST, NOT THE NEAR-TWIN. `--btn-secondary-
 * hover` (`#F1ECE4`) sits only 8-14 RGB points from `--surface-panel`
 * (`#F7F2EB`) — the "measured, not guessed" note above already logged that
 * pairing as barely distinguishable — so reusing it as the hover step would
 * repeat the same "no real fill-color shift" defect this file already fixed
 * once, just one token over. `--surface-quiet` (`#E2DDD4`) is a full step
 * darker (the same neutral `Badge`'s own kit-native "secondary" variant
 * draws everywhere it is NOT repointed to the panel tone), so hovering this
 * pill visibly darkens it — a real, legible fill change in both palettes.
 *
 * `!` because the app-wide rule in `web/app/layout.tsx`'s `<body>` repoints
 * every OTHER plain badge's fill to `--surface-panel` unconditionally, and
 * that rule doesn't know about this one, so this badge has to out-rank it by
 * importance rather than by specificity. `IDENTITY_ROW` (below) no longer
 * enters into this at all: it now rebinds the `--badge-quiet-fill` custom
 * property rather than matching a literal class (see that constant's own
 * comment for why), and this pill's own literal `!bg-surface-panel` /
 * `has-[a:hover]:!bg-surface-quiet` classes replace `secondary`'s
 * `bg-[var(--badge-quiet-fill,…)]` class outright in `cn()`'s merge — so
 * there was never a rebound property for this badge to read, and no gate is
 * needed on either side. NO OUTLINE: the
 * app's absolute rule for a hover indicator on a pill is a fill change,
 * never a border — the hover token replaces the fill outright rather than
 * adding a ring around it. Never an underline either — this chip already
 * reads as one from the `hover:text-foreground` ink step above, and the
 * pill's own fill change lives inside the pill, not around it. */

 * its all the time visible if there's content, should come when scrolling
 * down" — the ordinary sticky-footer flex trick, explicitly NOT
 * `position: sticky`/`fixed` (that is the second behaviour, the one the
 * client just ruled out, and it is `STICKY_TABS`'s own job below, on a
 * different region for a different reason).
 *
 * `app-shell.tsx`'s content div and `deep-link-screen.tsx`'s two wrappers
 * (see their own notes) float this component a real, resolved height —
 * `AppShell`'s body pane's own height, on a short record, rather than this
 * component's own short content. Two things then have to happen with that
 * height, both from OUT HERE, because `shared/ui/` is vendored and pinned
 * (CLAUDE.md, R39) and neither `RecordChrome` nor `RecordDetail` can be
 * hand-edited to do them itself:
 *
 * 1. `flex-1 min-h-0`, applied to `RecordChrome`'s OWN root (this class,
 *    where it is spent, on the component below) and reached again onto
 *    `data-slot=record-detail` (`RecordDetail`'s own root, one level
 *    inside `RecordChrome` — a plain `<div>` this file never touches
 *    directly) by a descendant selector, exactly `STICKY_TABS`'s own
 *    technique below for the same reason: nothing here draws that div, so a
 *    class is the only way to reach it. Both need the claim — `RecordChrome`
 *    is `flex flex-col` with `RecordDetail` as its one real child, so
 *    `RecordDetail` only grows to fill it if it ALSO claims the space.
 * 2. `margin-top: auto` on `[data-record-region=footer]` — `RecordDetail`'s
 *    OWN ink-footer card (record-detail.tsx: `data-record-region="footer"`,
 *    always the LAST child of its flex column). A flex column's last child
 *    with `margin-top: auto` consumes every pixel of slack above itself and
 *    is pushed to the column's own bottom edge — the same arithmetic as
 *    giving the PANEL `flex-grow` instead, without reaching past
 *    `RecordDetail`'s tabless case (this app hands its tabs through `panel`,
 *    never `RecordChrome`'s own `tabs` prop — this file's header, "THE TABS
 *    GO IN panel, NOT tabs" — so the sibling before the footer is always the
 *    one `panelBody` `Card`, never a `<Tabs>` wrapper; `margin-top: auto`
 *    reaches the footer directly and never has to name that sibling at all).
 *
 * NEITHER LINE TOUCHES SCROLLING. The document stays the one scroller
 * (this file's own header, and `app-shell.tsx`'s `overflow-x-clip` note) —
 * nothing here sets `overflow`, so a record long enough to exceed the
 * viewport just keeps growing this flex column past it, and the footer
 * scrolls into view at the end of the document exactly as an ordinary last
 * element would. Short content is the only case either line changes
 * anything for. */

/* THE RECORD'S OWN TITLE STEP (h1/44) AND THE TITLE/ACTIONS SPLIT (80%) BOTH
   MOVED OUT OF THIS FILE, 2026-09-06 — they are `RECORD_TITLE_TREATMENT` in
   `shared/web/record-heading.tsx` now, which carries the whole reasoning for
   each (the kit's `Title` has no h1 rung; the client's "reserve a % on the
   left for the buttons") verbatim.

   WHY THEY LEFT. Both were PRIVATE constants here, and this file is only ONE
   of the two ways this app draws a record detail. The other —
   `renderDetail` in `shared/web/screen-engine/screen-renderer.tsx`, which
   draws `team.detail`, `members.detail`, `invites.detail`, `brand.detail` and
   `purposes.detail` on both front doors — could not see either of them, so it
   fell through to the kit's own `titleSize = "h3"` and drew record names at
   24px where the thirteen screens below drew them at 44px. `team.detail` is
   the app's own landing screen. R52 is the law that now censuses both paths
   against the one constant, so the next patch to a record's title line cannot
   land on one path and miss the other.

   NOTHING ELSE IN THIS FILE MOVED. `FOOTER_TO_BOTTOM`, `PANEL_BELOW_TABS`,
   `RECORD_TABS_GEOMETRY` and `STICKY_TABS` stay private on purpose: they
   correct where THIS path puts its tab strip (inside the panel card, because
   this app hands its whole `TabsView` down through `panel`), and the recipe
   path has no such correction to make — the kit draws its strip as region 2,
   already a sibling above the card. See `RECORD_TITLE_TREATMENT`'s own note
   for the full reasoning. */

/** THE IDENTITY ROW'S OWN GEOMETRY — see `RecordScreen`'s own note at its
 * `identityChips`, below, for why this exists (a bigger, better-spaced pill
 * row, and a coloured-dot pill that finally has a visible fill) and why it
 * lives here instead of the vendored kit. Module-level, like `STICKY_TABS`
 * below it, because it closes over nothing.
 *
 * REVERSED, 2026-09-01 — CLIENT SCOPE CORRECTION. `RecordChipLink` (below)
 * was fixed to rest at exactly `#F7F2EB` (`--surface-panel`), and the client's
 * next word was that this is not one pill's rule, it is the ROW's: "every
 * pill in the record header EXCEPT the black ID chip" rests at that same
 * beige, the coloured STATUS pill (the dot + label one, e.g. "In progress")
 * included — only its dot keeps its status colour, the pill's own fill
 * follows the rest. That supersedes the contrast reasoning two paragraphs
 * down (`--surface-quiet` chosen because this row sits on the transparent
 * band rather than a card): the client has now seen `#F7F2EB` on this exact
 * row and asked for it anyway, so the rebind below reads `--surface-panel`,
 * matching the app-wide plain-badge tone instead of stepping one further
 * down the neutral ladder. `recordNumber` is untouched — it is always
 * `variant="inverse"`, which never reads `--badge-quiet-fill` at all, so it
 * stays the black chip the rest of this rule was never going to touch.
 *
 * THE HAIRLINE CAME BACK OUT, 2026-08-31 — CLIENT RULING, VERBATIM: "pills no
 * border!" This row briefly drew a `shadow-[var(--hairline)]` inset stroke
 * around its pills (both the plain ones, via the app-wide rule on `<body>`
 * in `web/app/layout.tsx`, and the coloured-dot ones, via this file's own
 * rule below) to answer the same contrast problem this comment already
 * named: `--surface-panel` (#F7F2EB) sits one faint step off `--background`
 * (#FFFEF9) — 8-14 points a side in RGB — and this row sits on the
 * transparent header band, which shows the ambient field through rather
 * than a card, so that faint step read as no pill shape at all. An inset
 * hairline answers a contrast problem with an outline, and BUILD-A-SCREEN.md
 * §6.1 is absolute: "separation is a fill or an inset shadow, never a
 * stroke" — the hairline traced a pill's WHOLE edge, which is a stroke by
 * any other name the moment it outlines a shape rather than shading one flat
 * surface, so it is gone, here and from the app-wide rule.
 *
 * THE REAL FIX IS A DIFFERENT FILL, SCOPED TO THIS ONE ROW. Every ordinary
 * pill elsewhere in the app (list badges, table badges, Contact's "Contact"
 * pill, the assistant's quota pill) keeps the client's own named colour,
 * `--surface-panel`, because each of those sits on a card or a list row —
 * genuine fill contrast against `--background` there. This row is the one
 * place a plain pill sits directly on the transparent band instead, so it
 * reaches one step further down the same neutral ladder to `--surface-quiet`
 * (#E2DDD4) — a FULL step darker than `--surface-panel`, not a faint one,
 * and the kit's own pre-existing "quiet chip" tone (`TOKENS.md` §2) rather
 * than an invented value.
 *
 * REBINDS THE KIT'S OWN ESCAPE HATCH, NOT A MATCHED CLASS — design-kit resync
 * 2026-09-01, `shared/ui/VERSION.json` v1.2.13 → v1.2.15. `secondary`
 * (badge.tsx) used to draw the literal `bg-surface-quiet` utility, which is
 * what let an earlier version of this rule reach it by class selector
 * (`[data-slot=badge].bg-surface-quiet`) with `!` to outrank the app-wide
 * `<body>` repoint on tied specificity. That resync turned it into
 * `bg-[var(--badge-quiet-fill,var(--surface-quiet))]` (badge.tsx's own
 * comment there, "THE FILL IS A CUSTOM PROPERTY WITH A FALLBACK") — a
 * different generated class string, so the class-selector rule silently
 * stopped matching ANY badge; nothing censuses whether an app-side override
 * selector like this still matches something real, so it went quiet instead
 * of red. Re-guessing Tailwind's new arbitrary-value string would only
 * repeat the same failure the next time the kit's class shape moves, so this
 * instead rebinds the custom property the kit built for exactly this case —
 * its own comment: "a caller rebinds `--badge-quiet-fill` locally to a
 * darker quiet tone." `[--badge-quiet-fill:var(--surface-quiet)]` on this
 * row's own root inherits into every plain badge inside it; `secondary`'s
 * class already reads that property, so this needs no descendant selector,
 * no class match and no `!important` — and it only ever touches the
 * `secondary` variant, since that is the one variant that reads
 * `--badge-quiet-fill` at all (every coloured, destructive, status-dot or
 * outline badge draws its fill from its own token, untouched). It wins over
 * `web/app/layout.tsx`'s `<body>` repoint (also aimed at the same now-dead
 * literal class, so currently inert too — flagged separately, out of this
 * row's scope) by ordinary CSS custom-property inheritance once that rule is
 * fixed the same way: this row's rebind sits on a descendant closer to the
 * badge than `<body>`, and the nearer declaration wins with no importance
 * war needed. The dot pill's own rule below is unrelated — `[data-dot]` is
 * an attribute this file's own JSX sets, not a kit-generated class, so it
 * never goes stale the way the class match did.
 *
 * `RecordChipLink`'s own badge (above) needs no gate against this rebind.
 * It carries its own literal `!bg-surface-panel has-[a:hover]:!bg-surface-
 * quiet` className, and `cn()`'s tailwind-merge setup (`shared/ui/lib/
 * utils.ts`) groups an arbitrary `bg-[...]` class and a literal `bg-*` class
 * as the same background-color conflict — so that badge's own background
 * class always replaces `secondary`'s `bg-[var(--badge-quiet-fill,…)]`
 * outright rather than sitting beside it and reading the rebound property.
 * A dropped class can't race a custom property it never reads. */

  // AT ALL, as of later the same day — "THE MARK IS GONE FROM THIS HEADER
  // TOO", this file's header comment — so the order is pills, title, subtitle

  //
  // `min-w-0` + `break-words` on the title's own span is item 4 of an earlier
  // ruling: "set a max width of the title so there's a minimum margin between
  // the title and the buttons in case the title is long." `Title`'s row
  // (shared/ui/components/title/title.tsx) is already `flex flex-wrap gap-4`,
  // which wraps a normal title onto its own line and keeps the `gap-4` clear of
  // `actions` — but that alone still overflows on ONE long unbreakable token (a
  // URL-shaped app name, say), because nothing tells the browser it may break
  // one. `min-w-0` lets the title's flex item shrink below its content's natural
  // width in the first place, and `break-words` is what it shrinks INTO instead
  // of pushing `actions` past the edge of the row. A LONG but BREAKABLE title

  //
  // `RecordChrome` (the kit's own template) draws `recordNumber` +

  // (`size="counter"`) badges — and that row is vendored and pinned (R39), so
  // it cannot be hand-edited here the way this file's title block works
  // around a different missing kit slot. The same trick applies: fold all
  // three into ONE node THIS file renders (above), and — since 2026-09-01 —
  // hand the kit NONE of `recordNumber`/`collectionLabel`/`chips` at all (see
  // the comment above `identityChips`), the row is ours end to end, wherever
  // it renders. `IDENTITY_ROW` is what reaches every Badge nested in that row
  // — the ones built here AND every one a screen hands in through `chips`,
  // since a `Badge` always carries the kit's own `data-slot="badge"` — to
  // give it the kit's bigger `size="pill"` geometry (copied from badge.tsx
  // verbatim, not invented) and, for a coloured-dot pill only (`[data-dot]`),
  // a visible `bg-surface-panel` fill: the kit's own `--pill-fill` is
  // `var(--card)` (ch11's "the OTHER paper tone from the `var(--sheet)` panel
  // the pill sits on"), but the identity row sits on the header BAND,
  // deliberately transparent (this file's own header, "lets the ambient field
  // through"), and in this app's off-beige palette `--card` equals
  // `--background` — so the pill's fill and its backdrop coincided, and a
  // coloured-dot pill drew as a dot and a word with no chip shape under them
  // at all, exactly the client's screenshot ("Development"). Every OTHER chip
  // in the row draws on the same fill (`Badge`'s own `secondary` variant,
  // repointed from the kit's `bg-surface-quiet` to `bg-surface-panel`
  // app-wide by the `[data-slot=badge]` rule on `<body>` in
  // `web/app/layout.tsx` — client correction, 2026-08-31: "use this color
  // #F7F2EB", which is `--surface-panel`), so this line matches that one
  // explicitly rather than drifting from it again. `--surface-panel`
  // (#F7F2EB) is one faint step off `--background` (#FFFEF9) — visibly less
  // contrast against this transparent band than the old `bg-surface-quiet`
  // had, so if a pill ever reads as "missing its background" again on this
  // row specifically, look here first. Scoped to this one row, so an ordinary
  // status badge elsewhere (a list row, an Overview field) is untouched — it
  // already gets the same fill through the layout-level rule. Logged
  // trade-off: ruling 26's dark-mode clause gives the charcoal-dot ("in
  // build") pill a mango fill on dark specifically because a charcoal dot
  // cannot be seen on an unlit pill; this rule overrides that fill uniformly,
  // in both palettes, to the same neutral every other chip already uses.
  // Nobody has reported the dark pill, and re-adding the exception needs a
  // `dark:` rule proven to answer the same light/dark switch tokens.css
  // itself keys on (system preference AND an explicit `data-theme`) — worth a
  // real check, not a guess, so it is left for that.

  // THE SUBTITLE LINE — see the `subtitle` prop's own doc comment above for
  // the client ruling. `text-badge`/`text-ink-tertiary` matches
  // `RecordDetail`'s own `meta` treatment (record-detail.tsx: "text-badge

  // SUBTITLE — CLIENT RULING, 2026-09-01, pointing at a screenshot of a real

  // pill row and the title, "in the current version pills are too close to
  // title." Before this, ALL THREE lines (pills, title, subtitle) sat in one
  // `flex-col gap-[var(--space-1h)]` column — one 6px gap reused for both
  // relationships, which read as too tight for the pills-to-title seam and
  // was never asked to change for the title-to-subtitle one. So the column
  // splits in two: the pills get their own wrapper with a real
  // `mb-[var(--space-4)]` (16px) under them, and a NESTED column keeps
  // title+subtitle at the original tight `gap-[var(--space-1h)]` — the
  // subtitle prop's own doc comment ("directly under the title") was never
  // re-ruled on, so that pairing stays as close as it always was.
  //
  // NOT `--space-3` (12px) — A FIRST PASS AT THIS FIX REACHED FOR IT AND
  // LANDED ON THE WRONG SEAM. `IDENTITY_ROW` (above) already spends `gap-3`
  // — literally `--space-3` — as the gap BETWEEN one pill and the next
  // inside the row; tokens.css's own comment names that value "control gap",
  // the space between two controls sitting on the same line. Reusing it here
  // would make the space between the WHOLE pill row and the title read as
  // identical to the space between one pill and its neighbour — the title
  // would look like one more chip in the row rather than the next row down,
  // which is the opposite of the hierarchy the client's screenshot asked
  // for. `--space-4` is tokens.css's own next step up, named "form rows,
  // list rows" — exactly this shape, one row (the pills) sitting above the
  // next (the title) — so it reads as a real, unambiguous break rather than
  // a same-size echo of the control gap one level down.

 * `[data-record-region="panel"]` `Card` the same way `FOOTER_TO_BOTTOM`
 * reaches `[data-slot=record-detail]` above — nothing here draws that div
 * either, so a class is the only way to reach it).
 *
 * WHY THE CARD HAS TO MOVE, NOT JUST THE STRIP. `STICKY_TABS` floats the tab
 * strip clear of the card by exactly `--record-tab-strip-h + --record-tab-gap`
 * — its own height plus the gap, the two things chapter 27 actually cares
 * about. But the strip is a DESCENDANT of the card (nested inside
 * `CardContent`, this file's own header, "THE TABS GO IN panel, NOT tabs"),
 * so floating it clear of the card floats it UP, off the card's own natural
 * position — and the card's natural position sits only `--space-3h` (14px)
 * below the header band (`record-detail.tsx`'s own `gap-[var(--space-3h)]`
 * flex column, vendored and pinned). A strip this tall, plus a real gap,
 * does not fit in 14px on ANY header, so without this rule the strip
 * overshoots past the header's own bottom edge and paints over its chips —
 * worse on a SHORT header (no mark, no subtitle) than a tall one, which is
 * exactly the failure mode the previous attempt's fixed pixel count could
 * never see, because it was tuned against one specific header's height and
 * never tested against a shorter one.
 *
 * Pushing the card down by the same `strip-h + gap` the strip is floating up
 * makes the two cancel exactly: the strip lands in the room this rule just
 * made, starting right where the card USED to start (immediately under the
 * header, past the existing 14px), and the card itself now starts exactly
 * one strip-height-plus-gap further down — with nothing in between but page
 * tone. Neither number is read off any header; both are read off the strip. */

/** The class a record's TabsView wears so its bar pins under the collapsed line.
 * A string rather than a wrapper for the reason RecordBody explains.
 *
 * THREE ROUNDS, ALL 2026-08-31. Round one split this into "sticky" (pin under
 * the header while the record scrolls — wanted, unconditionally) and the
 * FOLDER-only "flush cap" this used to also draw (escape the panel's inset,
 * take its top radius, zero gap) — right for a folder strip's own attached
 * shape and wrong for every actual consumer of this constant, which is
 * always a LINE strip (`RECORD_TABS_CONFIG`). That round LANDED the strip
 * back INSIDE the panel's own padding (no escape at all, `bg-surface-panel`
 * to match), reasoning the card's own top padding would read as space above
 * the strip. It shipped WRONG — caught immediately against the client's own
 * screenshot, verbatim: "nononono, now you put them INSIDE the content
 * container!!! it must be on top, with blank space in between!!!" Sitting
 * INSIDE the same padded card, on the card's own tone, is indistinguishable
 * from being part of it — one continuous peachy block — no matter how much
 * padding surrounds the strip, because there is no colour break and no edge
 * to read as "outside". The reference (and the client's own words both
 * times) needs three things in one glance: the strip on the PAGE tone, then
 * BLANK space, then the card's own full rounded-rectangle top edge.
 *
 * Round two escaped the panel's inset again (the strip must leave the card's
 * own box to read as not-part-of-it — `Card` sets no `overflow: hidden`,
 * card.tsx: "the shell sets no overflow: hidden", so nothing here clips a
 * child that overshoots above the card's own border box) and went FURTHER
 * than the panel's padding alone, by the strip's own height plus a real gap
 * — short of that, the strip's own box still overlaps the card's rounded
 * corner instead of clearing it. That half was right, and survives below.
 * What round two got wrong was reaching for a bare pixel count (`-mt-[170px]`)
 * to do it, tuned by eye against one screen — see `RECORD_TABS_GEOMETRY`'s own
 * comment above for why that is a header-shaped hole and what replaces it.
 * It also never noticed that the SAME escape drags the tab PANEL up with it:
 * the strip and its `TabsContent` are siblings in one `flex-col gap-4` `Tabs`
 * root (tabs.tsx: `variant === "folder" ? "gap-0" : "gap-4"`), so a bigger
 * negative margin on the strip pulls the content's start position up by the
 * same amount, through that fixed 16px gap. Every real call site (every
 * `*-detail.tsx` in this app) hands `TabsView` a `renderPanel`, so this was
 * never a strip-only bug — the content itself was mis-set the same amount
 * the strip overshot, just harder to see without a ruler. `gap-[…]` below
 * replaces the kit's fixed `gap-4` with exactly the CARD's own top padding
 * plus the gap, which is precisely the room the content needs to still land
 * at the card's ordinary inset, whatever the strip above it is doing.
 *
 * `bg-background` (page tone, not the card's `bg-surface-panel`) is what
 * makes the strip read as sitting on the ambient band above the card rather
 * than as a paper cap ON it, and no `rounded-t`: a floating strip with a
 * real gap under it owns no corner to match, unlike the flush cap round
 * one's CHANGELOG (below) drew for the folder case. The `-mx`/`px` pair is
 * unchanged from round two — a plain cancel-and-restore of `CardContent`'s
 * own horizontal ladder, never the header-shaped problem the vertical side
 * was.
 *
 * CHANGELOG, SUPERSEDED v1.2.28 — the flush-cap shape a FOLDER-variant strip
 * used to want, kept here as a historical pointer rather than a second unused
 * export, back when the folder shape existed to want it: cancel the panel's
 * inset on three sides (`-mx -mt px pt`, matching `CardContent`'s own ladder
 * exactly, not overshooting) and take the panel's own top radius
 * (`rounded-t-[var(--radius)]`), so the strip read as a cap flush with the
 * card underneath, cut clean from the soft-paper body below it. No record
 * screen ever hands a folder-variant strip through here — there is no such
 * variant left to hand (tabs-view.tsx's own header has the client's
 * 2026-09-02 ruling that killed it), and `CollectionCard`'s own `attached`
 * prop, the seam this paragraph used to point a future reader at, went with
 * it.
 *
 * TWO MORE FIXES, 2026-09-01, BOTH IN THE SAME `-mx`/`px` PAIR ABOVE.
 *
 * 1 · THE LEFT EDGE NOW MATCHES THE HEADER'S, NOT THE CARD'S. Client, on a
 *     screenshot of the Academy app's own strip: the leftmost tab sat well
 *     right of "Academy" and its mark, a visible empty notch before
 *     "Overview" — she wants the tab strip's own left edge flush with the
 *     header's. The `+px-6`/`+px-[space-7]` half of the cancel-and-restore
 *     was RESTORING the CARD's own inset (`CardContent`'s `p-6`/`lg:p-
 *     [space-7]`, verbatim, per this file's own note above) — correct for
 *     lining the strip up with the PANEL's content, wrong for lining it up
 *     with the HEADER, which sits at a much narrower `px-1` (4px,
 *     `record-detail.tsx`'s region 1: "4 of inline breathing so the band's
 *     type lines up with the panel's inset below it"). Measured live: the
 *     header's own content sat flush with the escaped strip's OUTER edge
 *     (the `-mx` half already lands there), and the strip's first trigger
 *     then sat a further `space-6`/`space-7` inside it — exactly the gap in
 *     the screenshot. So the restore is now `px-1`, matching the header at
 *     every breakpoint (the header's own inset never grows at `lg`, so
 *     neither does this) rather than the card's own responsive ladder.
 * 2 · THE ROW NO LONGER STRETCHES PAST ITS OWN TABS — `self-start`, AND
 *     SUPERSEDED BY AN EXPLICIT WIDTH, 2026-09-03 (STICKY_TABS's own comment,
 *     below, has the full story — this paragraph is kept for why `self-start`
 *     was reached for in the first place). `[role=tablist]` is a flex child
 *     of `<Tabs>` (`flex flex-col`, tabs.tsx — no `items-start`), so with
 *     nothing of its own saying otherwise it STRETCHES to the full cross-axis
 *     width of whatever it sits in — which, once escaped by `-mx-6`/
 *     `-mx-[space-7]` above, is the CARD's own full outer width, not the
 *     strip's own content. A record with fewer tabs than that width (any of
 *     them, and worse the more tabs fall short) got a large, blank, unstyled
 *     rectangle immediately after its last tab — reachable, hoverable, and
 *     drawing nothing, which is exactly the "mis-sized empty container" a
 *     screenshot of the App detail screen's own long strip (FluClinic: twelve
 *     tabs, still short of a wide desktop's width) showed sitting where a
 *     toolbar might otherwise go. `self-start` fixed THAT complaint — it
 *     opted this one flex child out of the column's default stretch, back to
 *     sizing itself off its own tabs — but it over-corrected: sizing to
 *     CONTENT is exactly as short of the card's true edge as sizing to
 *     un-escaped `max-w-full` was, just for a different reason, and it is
 *     what the client's next round of screenshots caught (STICKY_TABS's own
 *     comment). `self-start` is gone from the class list below; an explicit,
 *     escape-compensated `width` replaces it and covers both complaints at
 *     once — see that comment for the measurements. */
/* THE STRIP PINS AT THE PAGE'S OWN TOP EDGE — `top-0`, 2026-09-03. It used to
 * read `--record-tabs-top`, a MEASURED clearance the condensed stand-in title
 * published for it (a `ResizeObserver` on that bar, because a translated word
 * could change its line count), so the strip sat under the bar rather than
 * over it. The client deleted the bar — "when I scroll down, what is at the
 * top should be only the tabs, if there are tabs" — so there is nothing left
 * above the strip to clear, and the variable that carried the clearance went
 * with the file that published it. */
/* THE GAP IS PART OF THE PINNED STRIP'S OWN PAINTED BOX — 2026-09-03,
 * measured in a browser, not reasoned. It used to be the flex `gap` between
 * `[role=tablist]` and its `TabsContent` sibling on the `<Tabs>` root
 * (`gap-[calc(var(--space-6)_+_var(--record-tab-gap))]`), which is the same
 * mistake `STICKY_FOLDER_TABS` made with a margin and for the same reason: a
 * flex gap is FLOW, and the strip pinned inside it is not. `bg-background`
 * paints the tablist's own border box and nothing else, so the moment the
 * strip pinned, the `--record-tab-gap` band below it stopped being covered by
 * anything and the panel's own rows scrolled straight through it. Measured on
 * this file's own harness at 1440x900, scrolled 500px: the strip's painted
 * bottom sat at y=42.4 and a probe row spanned y=3.2-44.7 — 2.3px of a row
 * showing directly under the tabs, with the next row's top 9.8px below them
 * instead of the 18.75px the gap is worth. The client's own words are what
 * this fails: "make sure to maintain the space between tabs and content on all
 * screens, even when I scroll down."
 *
 * WHY A BORDER AND NOT `pb-`, WHICH IS WHAT THE COLLECTION STRIP USES. The two
 * strips pin DIFFERENT ELEMENTS. `STICKY_FOLDER_TABS` pins the `<Tabs>` ROOT
 * (a collection strip hands `TabsView` no `renderPanel`, so the root holds the
 * tablist and nothing else), and a root carries no mark of its own — padding
 * there is free. This one pins `[role=tablist]` ITSELF, because only the
 * tablist may escape the card (`-mx`/`-mt` below) while `TabsContent` stays
 * inside it. And the kit draws the line strip's baseline rule as an INSET
 * shadow on the tablist (`shadow-[inset_0_-0.0625rem_0_var(--border)]`,
 * tabs.tsx) — an inset shadow paints at the PADDING box's edge, so
 * `pb-[var(--record-tab-gap)]` drags the rule 18.75px down, away from the tabs
 * it underlines. Measured, both: with `pb-` the tablist's box bottom moved
 * 42.4 -> 61.2 while the triggers stayed at 43.4. A BOTTOM BORDER extends the
 * BORDER box instead — painted, part of the pinned element, and outside the
 * padding box the inset rule is clipped to — so the band is covered at every
 * scroll position and the baseline stays welded to the tabs. Same value, same
 * property owner (`--record-tab-gap`, itself `--tab-content-gap`), one seam.
 *
 * The flex gap drops by exactly what the border added, so nothing moves at
 * rest: the tablist's margin box is now `--record-tab-gap` taller, and the
 * room `TabsContent` needs to still land at the card's ordinary inset is
 * `--space-6`/`--space-7` alone. Verified at rest before and after — the
 * panel's top and the triggers' bottom are unchanged to 0.2px.
 *
 * THE STRIP'S OWN BOX NOW SPANS THE FULL WIDTH — CLIENT BUG, 2026-09-03,
 * TWO REPORTS, VERBATIM: "the shape of the folder tab shoudl be behind the
 * body, if not when i scroll down look what happens in my screenshots - its
 * overlapping nad cuts the content" and "also when scrolling the tabs shoudl
 * take all the width." A SECOND screenshot, on a Sprint detail screen
 * ("FluClinic-SPR0007", three tabs), showed the identical shape: the strip
 * stopping well short of the card's own right edge, with what looked like a
 * second panel's text bleeding through past it — same component, same class,
 * proving this was never page-specific.
 *
 * ROOT CAUSE, MEASURED (kwapso-design `verify/record-tab-strip/`, a harness
 * built from the kit's real `Card`/`Tabs`/`TabsList` against this exact class
 * string, before and after, at rest and scrolled): `self-start` sizes
 * `[role=tablist]` to its own TAB CONTENT, not to its container — correct for
 * "don't stretch," wrong for "cover the row you sit above." An 8-tab strip on
 * a 900px card measured 184px short of the card's own right edge; a 3-tab
 * strip (the sprint shape) measured 621px short. That uncovered band is
 * still inside the strip's own STICKY, z-10 vertical range, so a row
 * scrolling up through it is only hidden where a tab happens to sit — a row's
 * trailing content (a status pill, in the reported case) stays fully visible,
 * uncovered, scrolling straight through the same band the active tab's own
 * mango count badge occupies. Proven directly: with `self-start`, a "Done"
 * pill scrolled into the strip's own vertical range was NOT horizontally
 * covered by the strip's box (`horizontallyCovered: false` at every scroll
 * position where the pill sat under the strip) — exactly the "mango shape
 * cutting into scrolled content" the client saw. There was no separate
 * z-index bug: `[role=tablist]` already carries `z-10` over `sticky`, and
 * that was never the defect — the strip's own painted box simply didn't
 * reach far enough to need it.
 *
 * THE FIX IS AN EXPLICIT WIDTH, NOT A SWAP TO `w-full`. `[role=tablist]` is
 * escaped sideways by `-mx-6`/`-mx-[space-7]` (this rule, above) to align its
 * left edge with the header rather than the card's padded content — so a
 * bare `w-full` (100% of the SAME un-escaped containing block `self-start`
 * measured against) would land the box's right edge exactly `space-6`/
 * `space-7` short of the card's true edge, the same shortfall by a smaller
 * name. The width has to GROW by the escape amount on both sides, the
 * ordinary "full bleed" calc. `max-w-none` is required alongside it: the
 * kit's own `TabsList` (tabs.tsx) already carries `max-w-full` unconditionally,
 * which would otherwise clamp any wider explicit width straight back down to
 * 100% of the un-escaped container, silently undoing this. Individual
 * `TabsTrigger`s are UNTOUCHED — no `flex-1`, no stretch, each tab keeps its
 * own content width and the row still scrolls horizontally exactly as before
 * when there are more tabs than room (measured: a narrow host with 8 tabs
 * still requires the same horizontal scroll after this fix, `Tickets` simply
 * starts further right because there is more true width to show it in first).
 * This is the record strip's OWN track reaching full width, never a
 * per-tab stretch — the mechanism `BreadcrumbFolders` was reverted away from
 * the same day; that reversal is untouched and does not apply here, this is
 * a different component with a different problem. */
/* THE SAME DARK-MODE CORRECTION `STICKY_FOLDER_TABS` TOOK (tabs-view.tsx,
 * 2026-09-03): both the strip's own fill and the border standing in for the
 * gap below it read `--background`, the PAGE ground, where they need the
 * CARD's own `--surface-raised`. Identical in light (both `--kw-off-beige`),
 * a visible step apart in dark since today's spine work (`--kw-unlit-page`
 * #141310 vs `--kw-unlit-raised` #26241F). The client reported it on a
 * collection screen; this is the detail screen's own copy of the same strip,
 * fixed in the same pass rather than left to be reported a second time. */
