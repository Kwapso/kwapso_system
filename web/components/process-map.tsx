// A PROCESS, DRAWN — the same steps the list shows, as a route you can follow,
// and two versions side by side when you want to see what changed.
//
// VIEW ONLY, and that is the whole design brief rather than a limitation. It
// reads what is already on screen and writes nothing: no drag, no reordering, no
// editing. A map that edits is a second way to change a process, and the app
// already has one that works (the Steps list, with its own door and its own
// audit trail). Two ways to change one thing is two things to keep in step.
//
// BOXES DOWN THE PAGE, NOT A CANVAS, and the reason is in `agent-blocks.tsx`
// which reached the same conclusion for the same product: a laid-out graph is
// either a pile of overlapping labels at phone width or a thing you drag
// sideways, and a process map here is a SEQUENCE — first this, then that — which
// a column says more honestly than a canvas does. The owner asked for the
// simpler one first, and this is it.
//
// HOW TWO VERSIONS ALIGN. Every step carries a `stepKey` that is minted once and
// COPIED FORWARD when a version is cut, so version 1's "check it against the
// order" and version 4's are the same key and can be put on the same line. That
// is what makes a real comparison possible rather than two lists side by side
// hoping the order matches. A step present in one version and not the other gets
// its own line with a gap opposite, which is the honest way to show a step that
// was added or dropped.
//
// COLOUR CARRIES ONE THING ONLY: whether the step got faster, slower, or went
// away — and it is painted on the NEWER side alone. Both boxes of a pair used
// to take the tone, and on a phone (where the pair stacks) the owner read the
// result as soup: "with this whole mix of colours, it's a bit difficult to
// understand the difference between version 1 and version 2". The old box is
// the quiet past (muted fill, always); the new box says what changed; a short
// version chip on each box says WHICH version it is without re-reading a full
// label nine times. The tokens are the closed palette's own (R32) — no ramps,
// no hex.
