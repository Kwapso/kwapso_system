"use client"

// PROCESS MAPS — the sidebar page: what the work saved, and every map it came
// from.
//
// The VALUE comes first on purpose. The list of maps is how the team maintains
// the numbers; the number is why anybody maintains them. Putting the drill-down
// above the list means the first thing a person sees when they open this page is
// the sentence they will say to a client, with the App → Process → Step trail
// under it that answers the next question.
//
// The screen owns its own create dialog rather than routing through the host's
// ?panel machinery, the way the dropdown-values screen does: a map needs the
// list of apps to be created at all, and that is this screen's data.
