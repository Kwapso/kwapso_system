"use client"

// THE VALUE — hours given back, and every step they came from.
//
// The whole point of this panel is the DRILL, not the headline. A client asking
// "where does 208 hours come from?" gets an answer three clicks deep — App →
// Process → Step — and the last click shows the actual arithmetic: it took this
// long, it now takes this long, it happens this often. A savings figure a client
// cannot drill into is worse than no figure at all, because the first time they
// question it and nobody can answer, every other number in the app loses its
// credit too.
//
// R25: the caption ships WITH the number, from the one constant beside the
// arithmetic (shared/workers/savings.ts). It is not decoration around the
// feature — it is half of it. The times are estimates we agreed; the subtraction
// is arithmetic. A client who understands that trusts the figure; one who thinks
// we held a stopwatch stops trusting everything the day one figure looks wrong.
//
// REGRESSIONS ARE SHOWN, ALWAYS, on this side. A step that got slower is
// information: it is what tells the team a change cost somebody time. There is
// no filter here that hides one, and none anywhere else either — the client's
// side shows them too, with our explanation attached (BUILD-3 §3). What this
// panel adds is the nudge: it says how many of them we have not explained yet.

// THE PICTURE, beside the drill-down it used to be text-only above. `apps` comes
// back from the one savings seam sorted biggest saving first (savingsView, the
// order a client asks about first), so the chart and the accordion below it agree
// without either one sorting again. Reused from the agency's own chart split
// (pulse.tsx) rather than a new one — R39 and the "reuse, don't rebuild" seam —
// and guarded the same way the Work logs page guards its own: a bar chart of one
// bar is a sentence with a frame around it, so one app renders the sentence
// instead (BandCard/HoursByChart/NothingYet, pulse.tsx).
