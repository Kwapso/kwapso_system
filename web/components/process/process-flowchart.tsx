// THE PICTURE — a process map, drawn by the kit's own flowchart.
//
// READ-ONLY, BUILT FROM THE FORM. Aurora's ruling, and the right one: a canvas
// you can drag is a different feature with a different failure mode, and a
// picture you cannot edit can still be WRONG in only one way — by disagreeing
// with the steps underneath it. This draws the same rows the list draws, in the
// same order, from the same read. There is nothing for it to disagree with.
//
// THE SHAPE COMES FROM THREE FACTS ON A STEP, and no graph table:
//
//   • POSITION. Steps run in order, top to bottom.
//   • TWO STEPS AT THE SAME POSITION ARE A FORK — the owner's own proposal:
//     "one node at position two and two nodes at position three. We know the
//     split happens after position two." They rejoin where a single step appears
//     again, which needs no marker: the column count going back to one IS the
//     join.
//   • LOOPS BACK TO. "Feedback loops are real. We need to find a way to include
//     them." A step that sends work back says so on its own face.
//
// WHY THE KIT DRAWS IT AND THIS FILE DOES NOT.
// This was a hand-rolled SVG, and it was wrong in a way only a screen shows.
// An <svg width="100%"> with a viewBox scales its whole coordinate space to the
// container: on a 1600-wide page a 500-wide drawing is magnified 3.2x, so 13px
// type rendered at 42px and the boxes filled the screen. Nothing in the source
// says "huge"; the huge is the scaling.
//
// The kit ships `Flowchart` — collection view 23, "nodes and arrows, branches
// where a decision splits it", whose own fit line reads "Processes, approval
// paths, audit logic". It draws in the DOM, so type is type and a long name
// wraps instead of running out of its box; it has the four fills, the fork
// rail, the elbow that re-centres a branch onto the trunk, and the legend.
// Composing it is less code than the drawing it replaces AND it is the shape
// Aurora drew for this screen. "Too much code is a defect" (CLAUDE.md) cuts
// both ways: re-drawing a component the design system already ships is too
// much code.
