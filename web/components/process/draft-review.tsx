"use client"

// THE REVIEW — the screen between a read call and a client's process map.
//
// A PERSON REVIEWS AND CONFIRMS, ALWAYS, NO EXCEPTION. That is the ruling this
// screen exists to carry out, and everything about its shape follows from it:
// nothing here is pre-approved by being on screen, nothing lands until Apply is
// pressed, and Apply writes ONLY what survived.
//
// ── WHY THREE TABS AND NOT ONE BUTTON ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// "You can accept the steps and reject the tools" — both respondents, in the
// same words. The three kinds are three different KINDS OF CLAIM:
//
//   • that a step HAPPENS is something the client said out loud;
//   • that it is done by the dispatch clerk rather than the adjuster, or in the
//     spreadsheet rather than the inbox, is an INFERENCE — the same sentence
//     supports several readings, and the one the model picked is the one worth
//     doubting on its own.
//
// One "looks right" button would collapse three decisions into one, and the one
// it would collapse them into is the one nobody checks.
//
// ── WHY EACH TAB HAS TWO GROUPS ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Keeping and leaving out are shown as two lists rather than as a column of
// ticks, because a reviewer's real question is not "is this box ticked" but
// "what am I about to put on my client's record". The Keeping group IS that
// answer, at a glance, and a row moves between the groups as it is decided.
//
// ── THE NUMBERS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A duration of zero is not a blank to be tidied up: the extraction is
// instructed to answer 0 whenever the conversation did not actually say, and to
// write down what to ask. So a step with no time on it is shown as a QUESTION,
// with the question in it, and it is still perfectly applicable — the map takes
// it at zero and somebody goes and asks. `SAVINGS_CAPTION` rides at the bottom
// of the durations for the reason R25 gives: the sentence is what makes the
// number honest, and these numbers have not even been agreed yet.
