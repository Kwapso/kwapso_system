"use client"

// READ A CALL — the button that turns a conversation into a proposed process map,
// and the source picker in front of it.
//
// IT IS TWO STEPS AND NOT ONE, deliberately. Pressing it does not change the map.
// It spends one unit of the team's AI allowance, produces a PROPOSAL, and opens
// the review screen — and only what survives that review is ever written. Both
// respondents passed the comprehension check on exactly this: with eleven steps
// proposed and nobody having touched anything, what is on the client's record?
// "Nothing — the draft is not the record."
//
// THE SOURCE IS EITHER A MEETING WE HOLD OR TEXT SOMEBODY PASTED (the ruling:
// "both — a meeting if there is one, pasted text if there is not"). A meeting is
// offered first because the app already has the transcript; pasting is the way
// in for a call nobody recorded, which is most of them.
//
// It lives beside the map rather than on a screen of its own because a proposal
// is ABOUT a map — there is no useful "drafts" destination, only "what did that
// call say about this process".
