"use client"

// THE DATE SLIDER — the map, on any day it changed.
//
// ITS STOPS ARE THE DAYS SOMETHING HAPPENED, not a continuous range. A slider
// over every date between the audit and today would spend most of its travel on
// days nothing changed, and a person dragging it would learn nothing between
// stops. Every position on this one is a real state of the client's business.
//
// SO THE STOPS ARE DRAWN. That is the difference between a scrubber and a bar
// you drag: a mark under the track for every day this map changed, the audit
// date marked apart from the rest, and the one you are on filled. Without them
// the control cannot say how many states there are or where you are among them,
// which is most of what somebody wants from it before they touch it.
//
// THE AUDIT DATE IS ALWAYS A STOP, even when no step changed on it, because it
// is the day every figure is measured FROM. Landing on it shows the "before"
// the whole savings figure subtracts — which is what makes the number checkable
// rather than asserted.
//
// The kit's `Slider` carries the interaction: its own track, fill and thumb, and
// Radix's keyboard and screen-reader behaviour underneath. This file draws the
// stops and nothing else.
