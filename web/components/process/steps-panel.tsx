// THE STEPS PANEL — the map itself, its version picker, its money and its
// savings, lifted out of `process-detail.tsx` on 26 Aug 2026.
//
// WHY IT MOVED. The screen had reached 1,400 lines and this was 405 of them:
// a reader looking for how a version is CHOSEN had to scroll past the whole of
// how one is DRAWN, and the two have nothing to say to each other.
//
// WHY THREE PROPS AND NOT TWENTY-ONE. The block closed over twenty-four things,
// which is the honest signal that it is coupled to the screen's derived state
// rather than a widget that happens to live there. Listing all of them would
// have moved the mess rather than removed it, so they arrive as the three
// groups they already formed: what is being SHOWN, what the reader may DO, and
// the two ways to act. A prop list that names a shape is a decomposition; one
// that names twenty-one variables is a cut-and-paste with extra typing.
//
// NOTHING ELSE CHANGED. Same JSX, same order, same copy. The type checker is
// what proves it: every one of those twenty-four had to arrive from somewhere.

                 own named hairline shape rather than a border (kit §2.7,
                 web/test/kit-conformance.test.ts). A step's line wraps to two
                 and three lines, so without a rule between them a reader cannot

                 list on this screen where the divider is doing work no gap

                 `--hair` IS `--border` — so the line is in the same place, at
                 the same width, and the row loses only the 1px of height a
                 border added to its box.
                 WHAT DOES CHANGE IS THE COLOUR, and it is a fix rather than a
                 cost. `border-b` sets a width and a style and names no colour;
                 Tailwind v4's preflight leaves that at `currentColor`, so these
                 rules were drawn in the step's own ink at full strength —
                 near-black in light, near-white in dark — where every other
                 divider in this app (thirty `divide-border` sites) is the 8%
                 hairline. `shared-web-is-styled.test.ts` found the identical
                 fault in `form-shell.tsx` in August and wrote a one-file law
