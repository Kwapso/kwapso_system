"use client"

// WAVE DETAIL — one package a client bought, at /waves/<id>, as a tabbed record:
// Overview / Sprints. Its history is not a third tab any more — it is reached
// from the ink footer's Latest activity column, on the client's 2026-09-06
// ruling; web/components/activity-panel.tsx carries the ruling and the argument.
//
// THE SPRINTS TAB IS THE WHOLE SCREEN, really. A wave IS its sprints: putting
// one in or taking one out is the only thing that changes what the package runs
// between, because the dates are DERIVED from the sprints and recalculated by
// the door on every one of those writes. That is why the date line on the header
// carries no edit affordance — there is nothing to type, and a field somebody
// could type would let a wave disagree with the work inside it.
//
// TWO SPRINTS THAT CROSS ARE A WARNING, NEVER A REFUSAL. Aurora ruled it: "warn,
// but we can save it (it can happen…)". So the write lands, the door hands back
// the clash, and this screen says it out loud in a band under the header — both
// after the click that caused it and every time the record is opened afterwards,
// because a warning that only appears once is one nobody sees.
//
// THERE IS NO MONEY ON THIS SCREEN. No price, no margin, no rate — the owner
// took the whole of it out of the first version, and the table has no column for
// it. A sprint's own price is the work engine's to show, on the sprint's screen.
//
// Host-composed: the Sprints tab is a collection with an action of its own, and
// no engine block draws it.
