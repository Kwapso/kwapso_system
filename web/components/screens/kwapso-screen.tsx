"use client"

// KWAPSO — the agency itself, as a page (CHECKLIST 10.1, 17 Aug 2026).
//
// Three things that had no home together: the material we make our own work
// with, the people who make it, and the details that go on a contract. The owner
// asked for it in one sentence — "as a business owner you use this all the time"
// — and that sentence is also the argument for it being a destination rather
// than a corner of Settings. Settings is where you change how the app BEHAVES.
// None of this is a setting; it is who we are.
//
// THE TABS NAVIGATE NOTHING. The brand library keeps its own screen at /brand
// with its create, import and export, because it is a real collection with real
// actions and folding it in here would mean a second copy of all three. What
// this page shows is the way IN to it, plus the newest of what is in it, so the
// page answers "where is our logo?" without a detour.
//
// Every panel gates itself: the brand list on `brand_assets:read`, the people on
// `team_members:read`, and editing the details on `teams:edit`. The page itself
// is gated by nothing, because everybody in the team may look up the company's
// phone number.
