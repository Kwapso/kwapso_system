// SETTINGS — the APP's own housekeeping, and nothing about a person.
//
// The owner's ruling folded the old system's separate Admin / System / Kwapso
// sections in here rather than giving each a rail entry: they are all the same
// kind of thing (opened rarely and on purpose) and a nav rail that lists three
// of them reads as three destinations.
//
// TWO THINGS LEFT IT ON 17 AUG 2026, and the reason is the same for both.
//   • YOUR PROFILE AND YOUR EMAIL moved to a page of their own
//     (screens/profile-screen.tsx, reached from the profile menu). Everything
//     here is about the APP; those are about a PERSON, and a tester looking for
//     "change my name" should not have to guess which of three tabs holds it.
//   • THE TEAMS LIST is hidden rather than removed — shared/product.ts explains
//     at length why nothing underneath it was touched.
//
// REBUILT INTO FOUR TABS, 2026-09-01 — the flat one-page-with-headings shape
// above gave way to a real tab strip once the design kit's own Settings
// composition (shared/ui/compositions/screens/settings.tsx, ch26.05) named
// the shape: "a plain page-title header followed by the same underline tab
// strip used on every detail page's sub-tabs". Four tabs, in this order:
//
//   1. Appearance     — unchanged: Mode, Sidebar and Scale, exactly as they
//                        were on the flat page.
//   2. Members & roles — the team area's own Members and Member-roles lists
//                        (web/components/deep-link/collection-content.tsx),
//                        reused rather than rebuilt, stacked as two sections
//                        on one scrolling tab instead of two destinations one
//                        level down. Invites and Internal rates — the rest of
//                        "This team" — stay reachable as plain links here,
//                        since neither earned a tab of its own; the Teams
//                        list (hidden by TEAM_SCREENS_HIDDEN) rides along
//                        beside them, exactly as it always has.
//   3. Integrations   — Access tokens and the Google connection: both are a
//                        PERSON connecting something outside the app to their
//                        own account, which is what the word means here.
//   4. Choices        — formerly "Dropdown values", formerly its own tab on
//                        the team area's strip
//                        (web/components/choices/selectable-screen.tsx
//                        explains the rename and the move). This
//                        is the one door to it now; ManageDropdownsLink and
//                        every other in-app shortcut open straight to it via
//                        `?tab=choices`.
//
// NOTIFICATIONS IS GONE, on purpose (client ruling, 2026-09-01) — it was never
// live content in this app, only a tab named in the design kit's own reference
// composition, and dropping it was confirmed rather than an oversight.
//
// LINE TABS, A DELIBERATE EXCEPTION FOR THIS SCREEN. Every OTHER main/
// collection screen in the app takes the FOLDER variant (tabs-view.tsx's own
// default) because its strip switches between records or between
// collections; Settings' four tabs switch between SETTINGS SECTIONS instead,
// which is the exact carve-out that file's own doc already states for the
// line variant. Rather than naming that variant literally a second time (the
// thing web/test/rules.test.ts's "tab shape is decided in one place" census
// exists to catch), this spreads `RECORD_TABS_CONFIG` — the one constant
// record-chrome.tsx already declares for exactly this override — so the
// line strip's visual spec (underline weight, rounded ends, label colour,
// all fixed the same night as this rebuild) can only ever be tuned in the
// one place it already lives.
//
// A content component rendered inside the one deep-link shell (the shell
// provides the AppShell chrome).
