// Import screen — the AGENTIC multi-file wizard at /t/<teamId>/import
// (AGENTIC-IMPORT.md), drawn on the kit's own `ImportWizard`.
//
// THE FLOW IS THE KIT'S FIVE STEPS, and it always was — AGENTIC-IMPORT's own
// diagram is upload → plan → review → run → report. What this screen used to
// draw was three phases with two of the five hidden inside a busy banner: the
// agent's analysis and the write itself both happened behind a line of text
// with no rail, no progress and no way to tell how far along you were. The
// wizard makes both of them places you can be.
//
//   upload   the files, and beside them a sample of a good file per table
//            and what this team imported last time (`uploadAside`)
//   plan     how each file's columns line up with ours, per file, READ-ONLY —
//            there is no remap door (see `planContent` below)
//   review   the bottom line: how many rows will be written, how many skipped
//            and why, with the fix-list downloadable BEFORE anything runs
//   run      `batchConfirm` in flight
//   report   what actually happened, per target, with the rejected rows
//
// THREE PANELS ARE OURS AND TWO ARE THE KIT'S. The upload step is the kit's
// `FileUpload` and the run step is the kit's `Progress`; `planContent`,
// `reviewContent` and `reportContent` are supplied here because what they show
// is this app's business, not a wizard's. That is the component's own documented
// escape hatch ("Replace the whole X step"), not a way around it:
//   · the kit's plan step is a per-column `Select` editor driven by
//     `onMappingChange`, and there is no door behind it — `web/lib/api/data-ops.ts`
//     has batchStart/batchAddFile/batchPlan/batchConfirm/batchGet and no remap.
//     A control that cannot save is worse than a readout that does not pretend.
//   · the kit's review and report steps are `DataPreviewTable`, a per-row
//     checkbox grid. AGENTIC-IMPORT §1 rules "One confirm, not per row", and
//     `confirmBatch` re-scans every row regardless — a per-row checkbox here
//     would be a control that changes nothing.
//
// Host-composed (bespoke) because the multi-file plan-review UX isn't an engine
// recipe. Gated by the caller holding create on at least one import target.

              A SAMPLE FILE, NOT A DEMO TENANT. Every target hands out a real
              file with real example rows in this team's own column names
              (`/api/data-ops/import/sample`, AGENTIC-IMPORT §10) — so a person
              can see the shape of a good file, fill it in, and import it, which
              is the same road their real data takes rather than a rehearsal of
              it. Nothing is ever written into a team that the team did not ask
              for.
              WHY THERE IS NO "LOAD DEMO DATA" BUTTON AND NO "REMOVE IT" BESIDE
              IT. This app deactivates and never deletes (CONVENTIONS.md), so
              seeded example rows could not be taken away in one act — they
              would become permanent rows carrying an audit trail, in the same
              lists, on a real account's real screens, in the client portal's
              own reach. A sample file has no such afterlife: if it is wrong you
              close the tab. The route in was the real gap and it is fixed — the
              landing screen's own "Start here" block links this screen by name
              (web/components/screens/home-screen.tsx), where before today the
              only way to reach it was to type the URL.
              REACHED FROM A COLLECTION'S OWN "Import CSV" BUTTON, this list is
              narrowed to that one table (`initialTarget`); reached generically
