"use client"

// YOUR OWN PAGE — who you are, how we reach you, what language you read kwapso
// in, and what you have done.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT A TAB ON SETTINGS ANY MORE. Everything on this screen is about a
// PERSON; everything left on Settings is about the APP (the tokens a machine
// holds, the Google account this deployment may act through, the invitations
// waiting for you to accept). A tester looking for "change my name" opened
// Settings, found a strip called Account / Teams / Access, and had to guess —
// which is the owner's own note, and the reason this is a destination of its own
// reached from the profile menu, where a person already looks for themselves.
//
// It carries no team scope at all. A profile, an email address and a reading
// language belong to the person and follow them into any team they are in, so
// this screen renders directly in the shell beside /home and /settings rather
// than under /t/<teamId>.
