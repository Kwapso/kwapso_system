"use client"

// Add-or-edit-a-step dialog — everything a savings figure is built from, and the
// one form that collects it.
//
// THEY ARE ASKED FOR IN MINUTES, and stored in whole seconds. Nobody says "a
// step takes 2,400 seconds"; they say forty minutes. The conversion happens
// here, once, on the way in and on the way out.
//
// AND HOW OFTEN, IN THE PERIOD THEY SAY IT IN. "Twice a day" and "sixty times a
// month" are the same fact, and asking a person to convert it in their head at
// the moment they are describing their own job is how a wrong number gets typed.
// The pair is stored; the monthly figure is derived once, in the arithmetic.
//
// WHO DOES IT AND WHAT IN ARE PICK-OR-CREATE, and that is not a convenience.
// They were plain pickers first, and the fields HID THEMSELVES when a client had
// no roles recorded — which on 24 Aug 2026 was every client but one. The owner
// opened the form and reported four fields where there should have been six:
//
//   "I don't think the map edit screen has the ability for us to capture who
//    does it, like the rule."
//
// He was right, and hiding a control because its list is empty is the same
// defect as an archive with no button: the feature is invisible and there is no
// signpost to where you would create the thing. You map a process live in a room
// while somebody says "then it goes to the dispatch clerk" — so you type that,
// and it becomes a role there and then, with its cost filled in later.
//
// The form says plainly what the numbers ARE: estimates the two of you agreed,
// not measurements. That is the same sentence the client reads under the savings
// figure (R25), and it belongs on the form that produces it.
//
// FormShell (R4) + a per-session draft (R7), like every other write.
