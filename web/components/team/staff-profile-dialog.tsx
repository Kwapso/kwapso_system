"use client"

// A colleague's profile — what they are like and how they work best.
//
// This is the longest form in the app and the hardest to retype, because its
// answers are a conversation somebody had with a colleague rather than facts
// they can look up again. That is why the draft rule (R7) matters more here than
// anywhere else: a mis-tap on a phone half way through writing up a personality
// conversation should not cost the conversation.
//
// The wording is deliberately plain and deliberately kind. "What they are best
// at" and "what they find hard" are the same two fields the legacy app called
// strengths and weaknesses, asked the way a manager would actually ask them —
// and the subtitle says out loud who can read the answer, because somebody
// writing this about a colleague should know before they write it, not after.
//
// Library primitives, FormShell, per-session draft (R4 + R7).
