"use client"

// THE PERSON BEHIND THE MEMBER ROW — rendered under the member's own detail,
// which is where the owner asked for it: "they go on each member's own page,
// visible to the team, never to a client."
//
// It sits BELOW the member recipe rather than inside it as a tab, and that is a
// decision rather than a shortcut. A tab hides one of two things behind the
// other, and these two are read together: you look up a colleague to see who
// they are AND what they hold. The member's Overview and Activity tabs above
// stay exactly what they were — the team's record of the membership — and this
// is the record of the person.
//
// Both collections are gated on `staff_profiles`, so a role without that read
// right sees nothing here at all, and the member page it hangs off is unchanged.
// There is no client-facing counterpart anywhere: the module has no portal door.
