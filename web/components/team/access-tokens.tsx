       *
       * THIS IS THE SCREEN THE CLIENT WAS LOOKING AT. On 2026-09-09, over a
       * screenshot of this exact "New access token" dialog, she ruled:
       * "This should be a slide-in, like all the other screens. The only ones
       * that are overlays are the warnings, such as archive or delete, and so
       * on." It is recorded here, at the point where the presentation is
       * chosen, so that nobody reverts it as a style preference later. It is
       * not a preference and it is not about this one dialog: she was shown
       * one and answered about the class, which is why R59 derives its subject
       * instead of listing this file.
       *
       * THE TWO SURFACES ON THIS SCREEN LAND IN DIFFERENT BUCKETS, and that is
       * the point rather than an inconsistency. Tokens are dangerous material,
       * so the whole screen reads as warning-adjacent and the lazy move is to
       * leave all of it centred. Her line is drawn by what a surface DOES:
       * - THIS one COLLECTS a name and creates a credential → a form → a
       *   drawer. Its second face (the secret, shown once) is the same act
       *   finishing, on the same panel, so it moves with it.
       * - The REVOKE check further down ASKS a yes/no question about something
       *   that already exists → a warning → it stays an `AlertDialog`, centred,
       *   untouched by this change. "such as archive or delete, and so on" is
       *   exactly that control.
       *
       * WHY THIS ONE HAND-BUILDS ITS PANEL INSTEAD OF USING `FormShellDialog`,
       * which is how the app's other ~35 forms became drawers: that wrapper
       * renders a `FormShell` unconditionally, and this dialog has TWO faces
       * sharing one open state — the form, then the one-time secret reveal.
       * The wrapper has nowhere to put the second one. So the Sheet is built
       * here and mirrors the wrapper's own `SheetContent` decisions rather
       * than inventing new ones: `side="right"` (all the app's panels), the
       * same width clamp (a form panel is one width across the app), `p-0`
       * because `FormShell` owns its own edges. Two differences, both
       * deliberate: `showClose` is left at its default, because this caller
       * passes `FormShell` no `onCancel` and so draws no Cancel button — the
       * kit's ✕ chip is then the only dismiss control, and a panel with none
       * would be a worse bug than the one being fixed; and `overflow-hidden`
       * is NOT set, because `form-shell.tsx` moved clipping off the animated
       * element on purpose (its "FOCUS RING'S OUTER EDGE" note).
       *
       * `fill` on the FormShell below is the same reason `FormShellDialog`
       * passes it: the panel is already edge-to-edge and full-height, so the
       * shell fills it rather than sizing to content under an 85dvh cap. The
       * commit control then sits on the panel's own bottom edge at every
       * height, which is the whole reason the drawer is better here.
       *
       * After creating, the same panel shows the secret ONCE with a copy
       * button; it is never retrievable again. */}
