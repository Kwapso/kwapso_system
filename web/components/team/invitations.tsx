"use client"

// The invites inbox — invites the signed-in person has RECEIVED (by email).
// The fix for "I was invited but have no way to see/accept it": this works for
// ANY signed-in user, not just a teamless one at onboarding. Accepting joins the
// team AND makes it active (the locked "join + switch" choice). Cache-first via
// useCached, with one shared key so the page, the Settings section and the
// switcher badge all stay in sync.
//
// ONE WORD, "INVITE" (shared/glossary.ts), on both lists: this RECEIVED one and
// the SENT one in the team section, which used to read Invitations and Invites.
// Neither English word carries direction, so the direction rides the line around
// it ("Invites waiting for you") rather than a second noun. The route, the cache
// key and this filename keep the longer spelling on purpose — every invite email
// already sent deep-links to /invitations, and a rename would break those.
