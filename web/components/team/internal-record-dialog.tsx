"use client"

// ONE form for the three small RECORD kinds that share a shape — a brand asset,
// a meeting purpose, and a deliverable.
//
// They are the same form: a name, an optional vocabulary field, some prose, and
// one or two extras. Two dialogs would be two copies of one draft rule, one
// submit path and one busy state — and the day the draft rule changes, one of
// them quietly stops matching. So the SHAPE lives here and each kind supplies its
// FIELDS, which is the same trade the screen recipes make one layer up.
//
// The vocabulary fields (channel, status, category, department) are PICK-OR-
// CREATE: the picker offers what the team already uses, and typing something new
// adds it to the vocabulary rather than being refused. That is why they are a
// text input with a datalist rather than a Select — a Select can only ever offer
// what exists, which is the wrong answer for a field whose whole job is to grow.
//
// Library primitives, FormShell, per-session draft (R4 + R7).
