"use client"

// Account detail — one COMPANY at /accounts/<id>, as a tabbed record:
// Overview / its work / Rates / Knowledge. Its history is not the last tab any
// more — it is reached from the ink footer's Latest activity column, on the
// client's 2026-09-06 ruling; web/components/activity-panel.tsx carries the
// ruling and the argument.
// Host-composed, because most of those tabs are collections with their own
// actions — link a person, add an app, deactivate a rate — and no engine block draws
// those. Those list bodies live next door in account-detail-panels.tsx; this file
// owns the record itself — its data, its rights, its tabs and counts, its
// dialogs, and the one confirm they all share.
//
// A PERSON GETS A DIFFERENT SCREEN. Companies and people are one table (SCOPE
// ch.03) and were, until now, one screen — which drew a human being with sprints,
// a rate card and a Contacts tab of their own. This file reads the record and
// hands an individual straight to contact-detail.tsx: one door, one read, two
// screens. What splits is the SCREEN and the PERMISSION, never the table.
//
// THE LOGINS MOVED WITH THEM. Only a person can hold one (the owner's ruling), so
// the Portal access tab is on the contact's page now rather than on the company's
// — where it invited the question "who exactly is signing in?" and answered it
// with a list.
//
// THE PEOPLE ARE THEIR OWN PERMISSION. This account's own contacts are behind
// `contacts:read` — a developer opening a client sees the company and its
// apps, and not the address book. The server withholds the rows too
// (routes/accounts.ts): content that is not drawn is not a permission.
//
// NO CONTACTS TAB ANY MORE (client, 31 Aug 2026: "contacts as a real sidebar
// page, also remove the tab from inside accounts"). The address book across
// EVERY account now has its own destination (`/contacts`, grouped by company —
// see web/lib/screens.ts's `contactsListRecipe` and the "contacts" branch in
// collection-content.tsx). What survives HERE, on Overview, is the answer to
// "who is a contact of THIS account" — the add/link/remove controls that used
// to live on the tab, unchanged, because a company's own record is still where
// somebody adds or removes ITS people, and reading them nested under this
// company's own fields costs nothing new: the rows were already fetched for
// this screen either way.
//
// THE HIERARCHY IS STATED ONCE, IN THE HEADER — which account this one sits
// under, as a link one tap up the tree. It used to be stated twice, and the
// second telling was a tab called "Under this account" listing the rows whose
// parent pointer names this one. In this agency's data those rows are its
// people, so the record carried two tabs answering the same question under two
// names, which is the duplication the tester reported (7.2). That tab went and
// Contacts was the survivor; now Contacts itself has moved off the tab strip
// too, onto Overview and onto its own page — the parent pointer itself is
// untouched throughout.
//
// Every count here is an exact server COUNT(*) through the ONE formatCount seam
// (R16) — never the length of a list the door capped. Every destructive action is
// red and asks first; nothing is ever deleted (archive, unlink, revoke all keep
// the row, so history and access survive).
