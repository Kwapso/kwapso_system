"use client"

// THE AGENCY'S OWN HOUSEKEEPING, as screens — the two list pages behind the
// Brand library and the Meeting purposes.
//
// Its own file, so the deep-link collection switch stays a switch — the same
// reason processes-screen.tsx exists. Everything below is the standard
// arrangement said twice rather than abstracted into one loop, and that is
// deliberate: R16 (ii) requires each collection to render a
// `<CollectionHeading sectionKey="…">` naming its own section, so a generic
// component parameterised by key would satisfy nobody reading it and nothing
// checking it. Two short, obvious blocks beat one clever one.
