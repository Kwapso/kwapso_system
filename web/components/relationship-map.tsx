// THE RELATIONSHIP MAP — one record and what it is connected to.
//
// ── WHY SVG AND NOT A CANVAS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The plan said "2D force-directed canvas", and a canvas is what you reach for
// when the mental image is a hairball of thousands. This map is
// NEIGHBOURHOOD-FIRST — one record, what sits one step from it, capped at forty
// per edge — so the node count is under a hundred, and at that size a canvas is
// not the cheaper instrument but the more expensive one. A canvas node is a
// coordinate you must hit-test, label and make focusable BY HAND. An SVG node is
// an element that already does all three: tapping to open the record is an
// ordinary handler, it takes focus, it carries a name, and a keyboard reaches it.
//
// No new dependency either way — the force simulation below is arithmetic.
//
// ── TWO THINGS A DRAWING LIKE THIS HAS TO CARRY ─────────────────────────────
//
// 1. A FORCE SIMULATION IS ANIMATION, AND THIS ONE IS NOT SHOWN AT ALL. The
//    layout runs to convergence BEFORE the first paint and the settled positions
//    are what is drawn — so there is no convergence to watch, for anybody, and
//    `prefers-reduced-motion` has nothing to switch off. That is a stronger
//    answer than honouring the query: a reader with a vestibular disorder gets
//    the same map as everybody else rather than a quieter version of it, and
//    there is no second code path that could drift. The cost is one thing
//    nobody asked for — watching the graph arrange itself — and the gain is
//    that the map is never in a state that is wrong-but-moving.
//
// 2. POSITION IS THE INFORMATION HERE, AND POSITION DOES NOT NARRATE. Focusable
//    nodes are necessary and nowhere near sufficient: a screen reader handed
//    this control gets a bag of names and no relationships. So the same payload
//    is rendered a second time as sentences — "Dispatch is built for Mapland
//    GmbH" — reachable rather than hidden, because a text equivalent nobody
//    without a screen reader can find is a text equivalent nobody checks. One
//    query, two renderings; the door already returns exactly this shape.
//
// ── AND WHAT IT DOES NOT DRAW ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An edge whose far end the caller may not read never arrives here at all — the
// door removes it, both endpoints fenced, and does not count it either
// (workers/content/src/lib/record-map.ts carries that reasoning). So this file
// draws what it is given and has no fence of its own to get wrong.
