// AgentMarkdown — render the assistant's reply. A reply is a markdown string that
// may carry VISUAL BLOCKS (shared/agent-blocks.ts): fenced regions the app draws as
// real components instead of paragraphs of figures. So this splits the reply into
// segments (web/lib/agent-segments) and renders each one the right way:
//
//   text  → the shared markdown grouping (@shared/web/markdown-html), rendered as
//           REACT and injected with RichText's PROSE classes so a reply reads like
//           any other rich text in the app.
//   block → a real component (@/components/assistant/agent-blocks). React children, never
//           injected HTML — the structured path never touches innerHTML at all.
//   code  → a fence we closed and REFUSED (bad JSON, an unknown kind, a value that
//           wasn't a number): the model's own text, inert, in a <pre>. Shown rather
//           than swallowed, because a block that silently vanished would read as the
//           assistant having answered nothing.
//
// THIS IS THE ONE SEAM BOTH CHATS SHARE. The agent panel renders every bubble
// through here (web/lib/use-agent-chat.tsx), and so does anything that answers from
// the knowledge base — a knowledge panel gets blocks by using this component, with
// no second renderer to keep in step.
//
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY THE PROSE IS REACT NOW, AND NOT ONE INJECTED STRING.
//
// A citation mark is a `<Cite for="…">` — the design kit's own component (RULING
// D7-2), which reads the turn's sources out of context and draws the source's
// NUMBER. It has to sit inside the sentence it belongs to, and a component
// cannot be injected into an HTML string.
//
// The obvious alternative was to render the string as before and split its
// OUTPUT at each mark. That tears a paragraph in half: a `<p>` opened in one
// injected fragment and closed in the next is two block elements to the browser,
// so every citation would break its own line. So the BLOCK structure is built
// here in React from the shared grouping (`mdBlocks`), and only the INLINE
// markup of each line is still injected — the same escape-first subset, from the
// same `inline` the string renderer uses. There is no second markdown
// implementation and no widened HTML surface: what reaches `innerHTML` is
// strictly less than it was.

// ITEM 3 (owner, 31 Aug 2026): "fix the color of the texts from assistant...
// you invented that color. refer to guide and rules for colors!" Tracing every
// text colour in the assistant's bubble back to its source turned up exactly
// one that wasn't an app token: `inline()` (shared/web/markdown-html.ts) emits
// a bare `<a>` with no class at all, so a link inside a reply rendered in the
// BROWSER's own default blue — never an app colour, and the one genuine hit
// for "invented" in this trace. `RichText`'s own renderer (rich-text-view.tsx,
// used for ticket replies) never had this gap: it draws through the kit's
// `ArticleBody`, which already states the rule in its own words — "A link is
// ink, underlined, never coloured" — as `[&_a]:text-foreground [&_a]:underline
// [&_a]:underline-offset-[0.1875rem] [&_a]:decoration-hair-strong`.
// `AgentMarkdown` builds its own HTML rather than going through `ArticleBody`
// (this file's header explains why: a `<Cite>` component can't be injected
// into a string), so it never inherited that rule — copied here verbatim
// rather than re-derived, so the two renderers say the same thing about a
// link once the kit ever unifies them.

  // and a three-column table is not going to fit; the alternative — letting it
  // widen the panel — pushes the whole conversation sideways.
  //
  // IT NEEDS A FLOOR, OR IT CRUSHES INSTEAD OF SCROLLING. `w-full` alone obeys
  // whatever room it is given, so `overflow-x-auto` never engaged: measured on
  // staging 31 Aug 2026, a two-column table sat at 295px with cells wrapping
  // every second word, and the wrapper reported NO overflow at all, because the
  // table had already shrunk to fit it. `max-content` is the wrong floor in the
  // other direction — the same table went to 2757px, one unwrapped line per
  // cell. 28rem is a readable minimum for two columns.
  //
  // AND THE FLOOR THEN PUSHED THE PANEL SIDEWAYS ANYWAY — the half the fix above
  // did not have, and the defect the owner screenshotted. `min-w-0` lets a box
  // SHRINK; it does nothing about a box being SIZED BY ITS CONTENTS, and every
  // ancestor of this wrapper up to the chat bubble is shrink-to-fit. So the
  // 28rem floor propagated straight up: measured live on staging at 375px on
  // 1 Sep 2026, the wrapper was 504px wide with a scrollWidth of 504 — no
  // overflow to scroll, because the box had grown to its content — and the
  // bubble around it was 540px inside a column of 241. The conversation scrolled
  // sideways and the table was cut off, which is exactly what the floor was
  // added to prevent.
  //
  // `contain: inline-size` IS THE MISSING WORD, and it is the only one: it makes
  // this box's width independent of its contents, so the floor stops travelling
  // upward, the bubble sizes to the prose beside the table, and `overflow-x-auto`
  // finally has something to scroll. `w-full` then fills the room the bubble
  // really has, and the 14rem floor is for the one case containment breaks on
  // its own — a message that is NOTHING BUT a table, where a contained box
  // contributes zero and the bubble collapses to its own padding (measured: 36px).
  // 14rem + the bubble's padding fits inside 85% of a 320px phone, so the floor
  // never reintroduces the overflow it is guarding against.
  //
  // MEASURED, same panel, same table, same width: wrapper 205px with a
  // scrollWidth of 504 (it scrolls), bubble 241 inside its 273 column, and the
  // document's own scrollWidth back to 375. `min-w-0` was kept and is doing
  // nothing here now; containment is what carries it.
