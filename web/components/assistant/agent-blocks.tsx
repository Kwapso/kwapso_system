// THE VISUAL BLOCKS, AS PAINTED. One renderer per kind in shared/agent-blocks.ts,
// composed from the library's own primitives (UI-CONVENTIONS: the library is lego —
// nothing here forks the component library, and a block that needs a primitive we don't have is
// composed in the host and said out loud rather than added to the library from here).
//
// THE SAFETY STORY, in one paragraph, because it is the point of the whole feature.
// A block's data is MODEL OUTPUT — as untrusted as any request body. It has already
// been through `parseAgentBlock`, which type-checks every field positionally and
// refuses the block outright on anything it can't vouch for. What survives is passed
// to React as CHILDREN, so this file never touches `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and
// there is no markup for a crafted string to break out of. No field in the catalogue
// is a URL, so there is no href to sanitise either. That makes the structured path
// strictly safer than the markdown path beside it, which has to escape-then-allow.
//
// Widths are the other constraint: these render inside the assistant's side sheet
// (~400px) AND inside a full-width panel, so every block is composed to survive the
// narrow one — two columns at most, numbers that truncate, tables that scroll inside
// themselves rather than widening the conversation.

 * rather than borrowed from a chart library.
 *
 * LAID OUT DOWN THE PAGE, NEVER AS A CANVAS, and that is the whole design. A real
 * graph layout needs width to be legible, and the narrow host here is ~400px — a
 * box-and-line canvas at that width is either a pile of overlapping labels or a
 * thing you drag sideways. So the nodes are drawn in the order the model listed
 * them (its own reading order), the arrow BETWEEN two consecutive nodes becomes
 * the connector that joins them, and every other arrow — a branch, a loop back, a
 * skip — is drawn under its source as a labelled jump naming the box it goes to.
 * Nothing is hidden and nothing is invented: every edge appears exactly once.
 *
 * Composed in the host, not taken from the library: there is no graph primitive in
 * the library in `shared/ui/`, and this file does not fork it (see UI-GAPS.md). */
