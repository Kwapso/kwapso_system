// ASK THE KNOWLEDGE BASE — the way in, on the knowledge page and on a record's
// own knowledge tab. A question box, and the assistant opens with the question
// already asked.
//
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY THIS IS NOT A FORM WITH AN ANSWER UNDER IT ANY MORE.
//
// It was, and the reasoning for that was written down and was wrong in one
// specific way. The old panel argued for staying one-shot — "one request, one
// reply, nothing changed, no thread" — because a chat turn is expensive,
// stateful and can act, and a question is none of those. Every word of that is
// true and it answered the wrong question.
//
// THE OWNER, on what it cost him: an answer that came back too general and no
// way to say "no, I meant the dispatch window" — "I end up much more confused
// than clear." A question you cannot follow up is not a cheap conversation; it
// is a conversation that fails on turn one and makes you start again from
// nothing. So the one-shot form is gone, and its argument went with it rather
// than being left here as a comment defending the opposite of what the app now
// does.
//
// WHAT IT GAINS, and it is the whole reason the assistant is the right home:
// the answer now carries MARKS at the claims (RULING D7-2 — a numbered
// superscript where the sentence is made, and the source it came from
// underneath), the passages are one press away under every turn, and the next
// question is a follow-up rather than a fresh start.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS, said before it is spent. The old box could look for free —
// retrieval spends one embedding — and only charged when it wrote the answer
// out. The assistant charges for the turn. That is a real subtraction and it is
// the owner's decision, made with the number in front of him; the sentence
// under the box says it plainly rather than letting somebody discover it in the
// credit count.
//
// AND FOR A ROLE THAT CANNOT USE THE ASSISTANT AT ALL, this screen is now a
// refusal, so the refusal has to be a good one. Two different rights were in
// play here: reading the knowledge base is `knowledge:read` and asking a
// question is now `agent:create` — the right the chat door itself gates on
// (workers/data-ops/src/routes/agent.ts) — so somebody can hold the first and
// not the second. They keep the knowledge base — the list, every source, every record
// behind it — and lose only the ability to ASK. The sentence says exactly that,
// and who can change it, because "you don't have permission" on a screen with a
// question box on it reads as the product being broken.
