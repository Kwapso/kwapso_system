// WHAT THE ASSISTANT READ, under the answer it wrote — Law R23 on the screen.
//
// Two halves, and they are deliberately different things:
//
//   THE PILLS are the design kit's, exactly as RULING D7-2 draws them: numbered,
//   `collection · record`, in the order the retrieval handed back, with the
//   number derived from that order so a mark in the prose and the pill under it
//   cannot disagree. This file does not draw them and must not — it MAPS the
//   knowledge base's own citation onto the ruled two names and hands them to
//   `AgentChat`. `collection` is what KIND of material it is, in the same words
//   the knowledge base's own list uses; `record` is its title.
//
//   THE PASSAGES are ours, and they are the half the kit does not draw. This is
//   the thing NotebookLM is admired for and it is the reason anybody trusts an
//   answer: you can open the exact words it was written from. The one-shot ask
//   box showed them under every answer and losing them to gain a conversation
//   would have been a bad trade, so they are a disclosure under the pills —
//   closed by default, because a conversation of six answers each carrying four
//   passages is a wall of text rather than a chat.
//
// ── TWO GAPS IN THE KIT, LOGGED RATHER THAN WORKED AROUND QUIETLY ────────────
//
// 1 · A SOURCE PILL CANNOT OPEN THE SOURCE'S OWN SCREEN, and it must not be
//     made to. `AgentChatSource` offers `href` and nothing else, and the kit
//     renders it as a bare `<a>` — so an in-app path there is R37's exact bug in
//     a kit component: the browser throws the whole shell away, every module
//     re-runs and the running conversation goes with it. This app hit that class
//     three times and the build was green every time. So the pill's `href`
//     carries ONLY an external address (a document in somebody's Drive), and the
//     way to the source's own screen is the link inside the disclosure, which is
//     an `InAppLink` and soft-navigates. If you are here to "fix" the pill by
//     putting `/t/…` in `href`: that is the bug. The kit needs an `onOpen`
//     beside `href` — logged for Aurora as a defect, not a request.
//
// 2 · A TURN HAS NOWHERE TO PUT ITS EVIDENCE, so this rides inside the turn's
//     own `content`, under the answer. The two slots that look right are not:
//     `footnote` is a sentence, and `actions` is ruling 33's "the one press …
//     nothing is written until a person presses" — a read-only disclosure is
//     not that, and borrowing it quietly would blur the one slot whose whole
//     meaning is that something is about to be written.
//
//     AND `actions` DOES NOT FIT, MEASURED. Its row is a shrink-to-fit flex
//     item in an `items-start` column, so a child holding a paragraph resolves
//     to its MAX-CONTENT width: 509px inside a 324px bubble, with a horizontal
//     scrollbar across the whole conversation (in the browser, 27 Aug 2026).
//     `w-full`/`min-w-0` on this component cannot fix that — they resolve
//     against the row, which is already too wide. Inside `content` the block
//     context is the bubble's own and the passage wraps where it should.
//     The QUESTION for the kit stands: a turn that cites its sources needs a
//     place for the evidence behind them, and it does not have one.

/** WHAT A CITATION IS CALLED — and never nothing.
 *
 * A citation a reader cannot identify is not a citation. The pill has said this
 * since it was written, because the kit's ruling requires both halves of
 * `collection - record` and an empty one would render a dangling separator; the
 * DISCLOSURE below it did not, and rendered `{citation.title}` raw. On an empty
 * title that is an anchor with no text in it: a link a sighted reader cannot
 * see, a link a screen reader announces as its URL, and — on the one answer the
 * owner reported — a source in his evidence list that simply had no name.
 *
 * A source always has a KIND, because the sweep wrote it, so the kind is the
 * fallback. It is a poor name and it is a name; the alternative was a blank.
 *
 * ONE FUNCTION, used by both halves, for the reason R23 gives about the answer
 * itself: two places deciding the same thing is two places to fix it, and the
 * one that gets missed is the one nobody is looking at.

 * of a pill carrying one of them. So a source with no title would render an
 * empty half, and the fallback is its kind rather than a blank: a source always
 * has a kind, because the sweep wrote it.
 *
 * NO `confidence`. The kit carries one and draws it as a quiet suffix, and the
 * only number available here is the passage's RETRIEVAL SCORE — how close the
 * words were, not how sure the assistant is of the sentence it wrote. Putting
 * one under the other's name would be a number that reads as an answer's
 * confidence and is not.

 * the wait bought without having to click for it. Built entirely from facts
 * already on the wire (Law R23's own object — `reason`, `candidates`,
 * `reread`), never a timer and never a fake step: "a progress animation that
 * does not track real progress is a lie told with a spinner, and this base
 * does not ship those."
 *
 * `reason` RENDERS AS WRITTEN, not through `t()`. It is server-composed prose
 * with real account names already in it (`deriveCompartment`,
 * workers/content/src/lib/knowledge.ts) — the exact sentence R23 calls "WHY
 * those compartments, in words a person can disagree with", meant to be read
 * rather than only handed to the model. Like a citation's title or a

 * catalogued UI copy, so R28's walk never reaches it — it reaches the `t()`
