"use client"

// The app-wide AI co-pilot, mounted ONCE at the root layout so it rides ABOVE every
// screen and SURVIVES navigation. The assistant's screen-trace moves the page beneath
// it, and switching screens never tears the panel (or its live chat + step pills) down
// — the bug this fixes was mounting the panel inside the per-route AppShell, so every
// navigation (including the agent's own trace) closed it and dropped the run.
//
// It owns the panel, the phone's floating launcher, and the screen-trace engine. It
// reads the ACTIVE team (the module-cached session — safe to read from anywhere) and
// renders nothing until you're signed in with a team, so login / onboarding have no
// co-pilot.
//
// ── IT PICKS THE PRESENTATION, AND IT IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT ASKS ─────────────
//
// Since 2026-09-03 the assistant is a permanent COLUMN on the shared ground —
// `ScreenShell`'s `aside`, mirroring the rail across the card — and the shell
// drops that column below `md`, because a phone cannot spend 380px on it and the
// kit draws no drawer to hide it in. So both presentations exist and the WIDTH
// chooses, once, here: `useShellColumns()` is the same 48rem the kit's own docks
// are gated on, so JS and CSS can never disagree about which one is showing.
//
//   wide   → docked. The panel portals itself into the shell's column
//            (web/lib/agent-dock.tsx) and the shell's own 3px EDGE HANDLE is
//            what opens and closes it. No launcher is drawn at all.
//   narrow → floating. The launcher and the anchored `Popover` below, unchanged.
//
// THE LAUNCHER IS GONE ON WIDE SCREENS ON PURPOSE, AND IT IS THE ONE-MANGO RULE.
// It is a mango `size="icon"` button pinned over the card; the shell's handle now
// opens the same thing from the window's edge. Keeping both would be two controls
// for one decision AND a second mango control on every screen that already has
// its own — `SHELL.md`'s "only one mango in the pair", which the kit's own header
// spends four reasons on. The handle wins because it is the column's own
// affordance: it stands where the column will travel.
//
// ONE FLAG BEHIND BOTH. `useAgentOpen()` is the single "is the assistant showing"
// decision (web/lib/agent-open.ts, persisted per person like the rail's collapse),
// fed to the shell as `asideOpen` in app-shell.tsx and to the `Popover` here. A
// person who leaves it open on a laptop and turns the window narrow gets the
// floating panel already open, which is the honest reading of one flag.
