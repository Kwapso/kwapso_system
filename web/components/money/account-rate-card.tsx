"use client"

// WHAT THIS ACCOUNT IS CHARGED — the rate card, on the account's own record.
//
// It is a tab rather than a page because a rate card is not a thing anybody goes
// looking for on its own: the question is always "what do we charge Bergman",
// and Bergman is a record. So it sits beside their contacts and their apps, on
// the screen somebody is already on when the question comes up.
//
// THE OTHER CARD IS A DIFFERENT FILE, AND THAT IS THE LAW. What we charge a
// client and what our own hour costs us are the same shape and opposite
// audiences (SCOPE · R24): this one MAY be shown to a client through the
// portal's own value door when their price visibility is on; the internal one
// never leaves the agency, under any flag, ever. Two numbers with opposite
// audiences do not share a file, a door, a table or a screen — see
// internal-rate-card.tsx, which is deliberately not this file with a flag on it.
//
// Nothing here is deleted. A rate is RETIRED and stays readable, because what an
// account was charged last year has to stay true.
