"use client"

// WHAT AN HOUR OF OUR OWN WORK COSTS US — the agency's own cost card.
//
// THIS FILE IS THE AGENCY'S SIDE OF THE FENCE, AND IT HAS NO CLIENT-FACING TWIN.
// SCOPE's ruling is absolute: an internal rate and the margin computed from it
// never render in the portal — "not behind a permission, not behind a feature
// toggle, not for an admin viewing the portal" — and Law R24 makes that a fact
// about the import graph rather than a promise: the doors below all refuse a
// portal caller AT THE DOOR, the portal gateway does not forward them, and the
// build goes red if anything under web-portal/ so much as names them.
//
// So this is a SEPARATE FILE from account-rate-card.tsx on purpose, and it is not
// that file with a flag on it. A condition can be inverted and a permission can
// be granted; a file the client's app never imports cannot be. The worker says
// the same sentence about the same numbers in lib/internal-money.ts — read that
// header before changing anything here.
//
// It is a TAB on the team area (Settings → the team), beside members, roles and
// the dropdown values, because it is the agency's own admin: one small settled
// list of the kinds of work we do and what each costs us. It is gated on
// `commercials` read/create/edit/delete, so a role without that right never sees
// the destination at all.
//
// Nothing is deleted. A rate is RETIRED and stays readable, because a margin
// worked out last quarter has to keep meaning what it meant.
