"use client"

// WHAT THIS ACCOUNT ACTUALLY LEAVES US — revenue, minus our own time, minus what
// the tools cost, with every line of the subtraction on screen.
//
// THE FILE THIS ONE IS NOT. account-rate-card.tsx shows what a client is
// CHARGED, and the portal may show a client their own copy of it. This panel
// shows what our hour COSTS and what is left over, and no client may ever see
// either figure under any flag (SCOPE · R24). The two live in different files on
// both sides of the wire for the same reason: a condition can be inverted, an
// import cannot be forgotten. Nothing in web-portal/ imports this file, and the
// law's check reads that from the import graph rather than taking my word.
//
// EVERY LINE IS SHOWN, NOT JUST THE ANSWER. A margin somebody cannot check is a
// margin they stop believing the first time it looks wrong — the same argument
// impact-panel.tsx makes about a saving, and the reason `lines` comes back off
// the door already computed rather than being assembled here.
//
// It lives on the Rates tab, under the rate card, because "what do we charge
// them" and "what do we keep" are one thought and nobody holds them apart.
//
// AND IT SAYS WHERE THE COST CARD IS. This panel is the one screen in the app
// that spends the internal rate — every line of "our time" is an hour multiplied
// by it — and it named the cost card in a sentence while giving no way to reach
// it. The screen itself was never missing (Settings → Internal rates, with its
// own edit action); the ROUTE to it from the number it explains was. Gated on
// `commercials:edit`, the same right the door behind that screen opens with, so
// nobody is offered a destination they would be refused at.
