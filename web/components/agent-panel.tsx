// AgentPanel — the app-wide AI co-pilot. A permanent THIRD COLUMN on the
// shell's ground where there is room for one (`ScreenShell`'s `aside`), and the
// floating panel anchored off its launcher where there is not (below the kit's
// `md`, where the aside is dropped outright). ONE panel either way: only the
// box around it changes — see `PanelFrame` below. Mounted once at the root
// (agent-host.tsx, which owns go() + runAction() + the cache, so the agent can
// drive real screens) and portalled into the column. Built on the library
// AgentChat.
//
// This file is the RENDER SHELL only. The whole state machine — the transcript,
// streaming consumption (text deltas / live step rows / the confirm pause /
// terminal settle), per-device + cross-device thread resume, the broken-stream
// re-sync, staged file attachments (the chat import) and the send / confirm /
// new-chat / open-thread actions — lives in web/lib/use-agent-chat.tsx. The
// usage + history dialogs are self-contained components beside this one.
//
// The credit count (free daily + what an admin added) shows in the header. Using the agent needs
// agent:create; the server re-gates every action AS the signed-in user.

   THE FRAME — the ONE thing that differs between the two presentations.

   The assistant is a COLUMN on a wide screen (`ScreenShell`'s `aside`, kit
   v1.2.28) and a floating panel on a narrow one, because the kit drops its
   third column below `md` and a phone cannot spend 380px on it. Those are two
   BOXES, not two assistants: everything inside — the transcript, the streamed
   steps, the confirm pause, the citations, the composer, the attachments — is
   the same tree in both, rendered once below and handed to whichever box this
   width calls for. There is no second copy of the panel and no second copy of
   its state; `useAgentChat` is called once, in `AgentPanel`, above this.

   WHY THE COLUMN IS A PORTAL. The panel is mounted at the ROOT (agent-host.tsx)
   so it outlives navigation — including the navigation it causes itself, since
   a multi-step run drives the real screen. The shell's column is several levels
   BELOW that, inside the routed `AppShell`. `createPortal` is what lets one
   component be a child of the root in the React tree and a child of the column
   in the DOM; web/lib/agent-dock.tsx holds the node and the whole argument.
   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

/** WHAT BOTH BOXES PAINT, and it is the whole of what the owner ruled on.
 *
 * ITEM 1 (owner, 31 Aug 2026 — the precise repeat of the 28 Aug report,
 * GAPS-A.md OVL-1): "the background of the assistant should be white, and his
 * messages in beige." AT THE TIME, `--card` and `--popover` were #FFFEF9 in
 * light and #26241F in dark — IDENTICAL to `--background`, which is why the
 * earlier `bg-surface-panel` patch (still visible in git blame) never really
 * fixed it: `--surface-panel` (#F7F2EB light / #1C1B18 dark) sits only ONE
 * faint step from `--card`, not a genuinely different tone. So: the ground
 * was `bg-background` — the token tokens.css itself calls "the kwapso white"
 * — and every `bg-card` inside this one subtree (the assistant's bubble, its
 * composer pill, a pending confirm step's marker) is repointed, by a LOCALLY
 * SCOPED custom property, at `--surface-quiet` instead: #E2DDD4 light (a real
 * beige, not an off-white) and #3A3833 dark (distinctly lighter than the
 * near-black ground — the dark-mode variation the owner asked for). Still one
 * token each side, per R32 — reassigned for this one surface, not a new
 * colour, and not a change to `--card` anywhere else in the app. Your OWN
 * messages (`bg-surface-inverse`, ruling 36's charcoal-on-light /
 * off-beige-on-dark fill) were never part of this bug — checked: they sit
 * nowhere near the ground tone in either palette.
 *
 * ITEM 3 (owner, 31 Aug 2026): "fix the color of the texts... you invented that
 * color. refer to guide and rules for colors!" `--card-foreground` is set
 * EXPLICITLY here, alongside `--card`, rather than left to inherit — R32's own
 * words, "what a colour MEANS has a token": both halves of this surface's
 * paper/ink pair are now named together in one place instead of one being
 * declared and the other assumed. The VALUE is unchanged (`var(--foreground)`
 * is exactly what `--card-foreground` already resolves to globally —
 * tokens.css line 203 — so no bubble repaints), which is the honest finding
 * after tracing every text colour in this surface back to its source: the
 * assistant's bubble (`text-card-foreground`, agent-chat.tsx's `turnVariants`),
 * the composer's typed text (`text-foreground`, `textarea.tsx`'s own base
 * class, FLD-B5) and your own sent bubble (`text-ink-on-inverse`) all already
 * resolve through real, paired tokens with strong contrast in both palettes.
 * The one GENUINE gap found while tracing this: `shared/web/markdown-html.ts`
 * emits bare `<a>`/`<code>`/`<strong>` with no class at all, so a link inside
 * an assistant reply was rendering in the BROWSER'S default blue rather than
 * any app token — fixed in `agent-markdown.tsx`.
 *
 * CORRECTION (client screenshot, 3 Sep 2026, dark mode, Settings screen):
 * "the background of assistant should be the same as the background of
 * content." ITEM 1's own premise had gone stale under it without anybody
 * touching this file: a later dark-mode token pass (the three-spine work)
 * split `--card` (#26241F, `--kw-unlit-raised`) away from `--background`
 * (#141310, `--kw-unlit-page`) — they are NO LONGER identical in dark, only
 * in light (both still `--kw-off-beige`), which is exactly why this read as
 * "barely different near-blacks" instead of a loud break: it is dark-mode
 * only, and the two shades are close enough to miss without measuring them.
 * The content card was never painted from `--background` — it uses
 * `--surface-raised` (`screen-shell.tsx`'s `CARD`, `bg-[var(--surface-raised)]`),
 * which resolves through `--card` — so once the token split, this panel's own
 * `bg-background` quietly stopped matching the card it was built to sit
 * beside. Simply swapping to `bg-card`/`bg-[var(--surface-raised)]` ON THIS
 * SAME element is not the fix: this element ALSO repoints `--card` to
 * `--surface-quiet` for ITEM 1's own beige retint below, and a custom
 * property resolves from the FINAL cascaded value on an element, not
 * declaration order within one class list — reading `--card` here would read
 * the beige it just reassigned, not the true raised tone. So the two
 * concerns now live on two different elements: this outer surface reads the
 * genuine, un-repointed `--surface-raised` (`PANEL_SURFACE`, below), and the
 * `--card`/`--card-foreground` retint moves one level down, onto
 * `PANEL_QUIET_SCOPE`, wrapped around `{children}` at both render sites —
 * still scoped to exactly the same subtree (header included, same as
 * before), so every `bg-card` this comment already named (the bubble, the
 * composer pill, the confirm marker) keeps reading `--surface-quiet`
 * unchanged; only the PANEL's OWN ground now resolves independently of that
 * repoint. */
const PANEL_SURFACE = "flex flex-col overflow-hidden bg-[var(--surface-raised)]"

/** THE QUIET RETINT SCOPE — ITEM 1's `--card` → `--surface-quiet` reassignment,
 * moved off the outer surface (see the CORRECTION above `PANEL_SURFACE`) onto
 * a wrapper around `{children}`, so it retints the assistant's own bubble /
 * composer / confirm marker without also being read back by the ground
 * that surrounds them. `flex-1 min-h-0 flex-col` reproduces the layout the
 * outer element used to do directly (this wrapper is now its one child, and
 * needs to fill it the same way) so the header (`shrink-0`) and the content
 * column (`flex-1 min-h-0`) inside still stack and size exactly as before. */

 * the inset and the column's own scroller, so this only has to FILL it — no
 * width of its own, which is also R29 by the letter (no second page measure).
 *
 * IT IS PAPER ON THE GROUND, EXACTLY AS THE CARD IS. `ScreenShell`'s own table
 * puts the aside at the same level as the rail — "NOT a container, lies on it,
 * paints nothing" — so the column paints nothing and the assistant's own
 * surface is this app's node: the same `rounded-[var(--radius)]` (R31, no third
 * radius) and the same `--shadow-lifted` the shell gives the screen card, so
 * the two things floating on the spine read as siblings rather than as a card
 * beside a bare stack. The background itself now lives on `PANEL_SURFACE`
 * (`bg-[var(--surface-raised)]`, the same expression `screen-shell.tsx`'s own
 * `CARD` uses for the content card) rather than here — see the CORRECTION
 * comment above it for why this used to say `bg-background` and no longer

 * the full container for the assistant would be aligned with the main one."
 * `screen-shell.tsx` now draws that tab (`asideLabel`, through
 * `BreadcrumbFolders`) directly above this column, the SAME way the content
 * card's own trail sits above IT — so this panel needs the SAME "one corner
 * given up for the joint" move `CARD_JOINED` makes there, for the identical
 * reason: the tab's silhouette is a fixed SVG path (`folder.tsx`) that may
 * not be edited, and a plain CSS radius is this file's own to remove.
 * `rounded-ss-none`, not `-tl-`, so it mirrors with the tab in RTL for free —
 * R31 by the letter (zero is the absence of a radius, not a third one; see

  // either: the role is `sr-only` above each bubble regardless (`userLabel`/
  // `assistantLabel` in the kit component), untouched by this change. So the
  // two speakers stay unambiguous through alignment + fill exactly as they
  // did before the avatar existed on top of them; nothing new is invented
  // here to replace it.

  // bubble", then 1 Sep "make it eyebrow and aligned to right on my messages
  // and to left on the assistant's. a bit more space… currently its
  // overlapping", then the client's screenshot of the LOADING turn: a small

  // at a time down the panel, and a request that the label move BELOW the
  // bubble instead of above it, with the avatar riding the TOP of a tall,
  // multi-line bubble rather than its full-height centre.
  //
  // ROOT CAUSE OF THE LETTER-WRAP, FOUND ON THE PENDING TURN SPECIFICALLY:
  // the label used to be `inset-x-0` — STRETCHED to the width of its
  // positioned ancestor. That is fine once the bubble holds real words, but
  // the turn that is still waiting for its first token is pushed with
  // `content: ""` (use-agent-chat.tsx's optimistic placeholder), and an
  // empty box has nothing to size itself by: absolutely positioned
  // descendants take no part in a box's own width calculation (CSS §10.3.7),
  // so the bubble collapsed to its bare `px-4`/padding and the label
  // stretched to fit THAT — a container a few pixels wide, which is exactly
  // where "just now" started breaking one character per line. Fixed at the
  // root two ways at once: the label is `whitespace-nowrap` now (its own

    // button in agent-host.tsx (which owns the `Popover` root + trigger, and
    // renders this component as its content) — NOT the kit's own
    // `overlays/assistant.tsx` / `CopilotOverlay`. Checked first, per the law
    // of this change: that composition's own file header names it
    // "CONTRADICTION 1" — chapter 19 calls for a corner-anchored floating
    // card, but what got BUILT, on purpose, "because it is the delivery
    // contract", is a right-hand `Sheet` (`copilot-overlay.tsx` lines ~43-68).
    // Adopting it would trade one slide-in drawer for another, not for a
    // bubble — the one thing this change is asked to fix — while also
    // dropping this app's whole message model (streamed chunks, tool-step
    // rows, R23 citations, staged file attachments) for `CopilotOverlay`'s
    // flat `CopilotMessage` list, which has no concept of any of them. A
    // genuine mismatch, not a missed adoption (COMPOSITION-MISMATCHES.md
    // already carries a `[!]` row for it, on different — and now stale —
    // reasoning: it says this app's panel "is deliberately modal", which is
    // no longer true of this file at all — the panel was already
    // `modal={false}` before this change and stays non-modal now, only on a
    // different primitive. Worth a follow-up correction to that file; out of
    // scope here).
    //
    // So: the kit's own anchored primitive one level down — `Popover`
    // (`components/popover/popover.tsx`, 3 existing call sites) — composed by
    // hand into a chat-sized panel, same as `record-picker.tsx` composes
    // `Popover` + `Command` rather than reaching for a mismatched whole
    // composition. Never modal, never traps focus (Radix's own Popover
    // default — nothing passed here changes it), which is this surface's law
    // regardless of primitive: you can type in a table while the assistant is
    // open.
    //
    // The usage + history dialogs render as SIBLINGS of the popover content
    // (below), not nested inside it — exactly as they were siblings of
    // `SheetContent` before. Radix unmounts a closed overlay's content, so
    // nesting them inside would have closed Usage/ClockCounterClockwise the instant the
    // assistant bubble itself closed, which was never the intent (open Usage
    // from the panel, then dismiss the panel with Escape — Usage stays put).

            dont need it anymore)". The launcher button itself already toggles
            open/closed (agent-host.tsx, this round's own item 3 fix), and
            Escape / outside-click still close a Popover on their own — a
            second, redundant close control is gone outright, not just hidden.

            ITEM 5 — "put the + and history button... on top next to the
            title assistant... copy the rules for when we put buttons next to
            a title". That rule is a real, unused kit part: `Title`
            (shared/ui/components/title/title.tsx, 0 direct call sites before
            this) — eyebrow/heading on the start, `actions` pushed to the end
            with `ms-auto`, wrapping on a narrow row, exactly the "aligned
            with the title" convention record-chrome.tsx just adopted for
            record detail screens today (override 73 / the 31 Aug refinement).
            `rule={false}` — the heavy hairline `Title` draws under its own
            row would double up with this header block's own
            `shadow-[var(--hairline-under)]` underneath the quota badge.
            `size="h4"` — the "band inside a panel" step (20px), not `h2`'s
            32px page-section size; this is a popover, not a page.

            THE VISIBLE HEADING TEXT IS DOCKED-ONLY NOW. Client, 2026-09-03:
            "Assistante (the name) should be a folder tab, like the
            breadcrumbs - then the full container for the assistant would be
            aligned with the main one." — so on a wide screen the word
            "Assistant" moved OUT of this row and onto the folder tab
            `screen-shell.tsx` now draws above the whole column
            (`asideLabel`, through `BreadcrumbFolders`); saying it again here
            would be the same word twice, stacked. The heading stays — an
            `sr-only` span, not a removed element — because this row still
            needs an accessible name for its own action buttons' landmark and
            a docked screen reader shouldn't hear NOTHING where a heading was.
            THE POPOVER KEEPS THE VISIBLE WORD: the floating panel (narrow
            screens) draws no tab above it — there is nothing beside it to
            align with — so its own heading is still the only place the name
            is said, exactly as it always was. */}

              belongs to AgentChat, so "above the composer" and "at the bottom
              of the panel" are the same place). It is a fact about the APP,
              not something the assistant said, so it stays outside the
              conversation entirely. Clears the moment the next question is
              asked. */}

              lied.

              UNDER THE HEADER, NOT UNDER THE INPUT, and the owner asked for
              "above the input". Two reasons, and the first is this file's own
              precedent: the limit notice was moved out from under the composer
              on 27 Aug 2026 because the composer belongs to `AgentChat`, so
              "above the composer" and "at the bottom of the panel" are the
              same place — and a row of controls stranded below the input reads
              as an afterthought rather than as the scope the conversation is
              running under. The second is that this IS the conversation's
              scope, not the message's: it is held for the whole thread, so it
              belongs where the thread's other facts are.

              THE LAST CHIP ON STAYS ON — see `toggleSource`: an empty list
              reads as "every door" everywhere behind this, so unticking the

              the attach button to the left of the send button" on 1 Sep), THEN
              FOUND ACTUALLY OVERLAPPING ON LIVE RENDER (owner, 1 Sep, round 6:
              "13, attach is overlapping, and not fully visible").
              AgentChat's composer is one opaque pill (Textarea + Send) with
              no attach slot to reach INTO — TicketThread already carries
              exactly this feature as a real prop (`onAttach`, a paperclip
              drawn inside its own pill, left of the field); AgentChat has no
              equivalent yet (logged for Aurora — the real fix is that prop,
              mirrored from TicketThread's).
              THE TWO SIDES ARE NOT SYMMETRIC, and that is why this is a
              different reservation, not just a different `end-*` number.
              "Right of Send" could vacate space by pushing the COMPOSER's own
              trailing padding wider (`pe-11` on `agent-chat-composer`), which
              carries Send inward WITH it — Send stayed the last flex child,
              just closer to centre. "Left of Send" must NOT move Send at
              all, so the reservation instead goes on the TEXTAREA itself
              (below): the composer's own edge padding and Send's position are
              both untouched, and the textarea's typed text simply wraps well
              before ITS OWN right edge — which is exactly the strip
              immediately left of Send, since the textarea's right edge IS
              Send's left edge.
              WHY IT OVERLAPPED: Send here is `Button size="sm"` — height
              `--control-height-dense` (32px) but WIDTH is `px-4` (16px) either
              side of the `Send` glyph, NOT a forced square. Measured on an
              actual render (this file's own comment claimed a 32px SQUARE
              Send, copied from a DIFFERENT composer, `copilot-overlay.tsx`'s,
              without checking this one): Send is ~45px wide, so a strip sized
              for a 32px Send left the paperclip's own 32px lapping ~11px into
              it. Re-measured this time, not re-derived: composer `pe-2` (8px)
              + Send's real ~45px + a gap ≈ 60px before Send's own left edge —
              `end-16` (64px) puts the paperclip comfortably past it, and
              `pe-28` (112px) on the textarea clears the paperclip's own 32px
              with room to spare, so typed text never runs under either
              control. `bottom-2` still matches Send's own vertical inset. */}
