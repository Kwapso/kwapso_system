// CONTACT DETAIL — a PERSON's own screen, at /accounts/<id> when that account is
// an individual.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. Companies and people are one table (SCOPE ch.03,
// and the owner ruled it twice: two tables would cap a person at one company and
// Marta is a contact at two). What was never true is that they are one SCREEN. A
// person was being drawn with a company's tabs — sprints they are not on, a rate
// card that is nobody's, a Contacts tab listing the people inside a human being —
// and the fix is a second screen over the same row, not a second table under it.
//
// So a contact's page carries exactly what a contact has, and the list came from
// the people who use it: their details, the companies they belong to, the to-dos
// we are waiting on them for, the tickets raised for them, the meetings they were
// in, their portal login, and their history.
//
// THE LOGIN LIVES HERE NOW, and that is the other half of the ruling: only a
// PERSON can hold one. It used to be a tab on the company, which invited the
// question "who exactly is signing in?" and answered it with a list. A login
// belongs to somebody with a name.
//
// TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS ABOUT COMPANIES, and this screen answers both without
// confusing them. WHO THEY WORK FOR is the parent account: one company, the one
// the address book files them under and the one whose Contacts tab groups them
// in. THE COMPANIES THEY ARE A CONTACT OF are the links, plural, on the
// Companies tab and in the chips under the title — Marta can be a contact of
// Bergman and of Delaval at once, which is the thing a single pointer cannot say
// and the reason both exist.
//
// THE EMPLOYER IS THE ONE THAT GETS A CONTROL HERE. The parent picker came off
// the account form on 18 Aug 2026 on the owner's ruling — right for a company,
// which is its own thing and never a subsidiary of one already on the books —
// and it left a person who changes jobs with no screen that could move her. The
// answer was never to put the picker back on a company's form; it is this, on
// the person. The links keep their own control where it belongs, on the
// COMPANY's Contacts tab, beside the list it changes. Nothing here writes one.
//
// Host-composed rather than a recipe, for the reason the account screen is: three
// of these tabs are collections with their own actions, and no engine block draws
// one. Its counts are exact server totals through the one formatCount seam (R16),
// its tabs are the library TabsView (R3), and its history is read through the
// generic record path (R5) and shown in the ink footer's Latest activity column
// — not a tab, on the client's 2026-09-06 ruling
// (web/components/records/activity-panel.tsx carries it).

                    People change jobs; before this, moving one was a sentence
                    somebody said to the assistant. It sits under the row it
                    edits, and it stays a two-step — pick, then press — because
                    where a person sits decides what a client login can see.

                    IT OFFERS COMPANIES AND NOTHING ELSE (`type: "entity"`), which
                    is what makes "put her under herself" unreachable from this
                    screen rather than merely refused by the door: a contact is a
                    person, and no person is in this list. Archived companies are
                    left out too (`searchAccounts` asks the door for the live
                    ones) — a put-away company is not something new work is filed
                    against — while somebody ALREADY under one still reads it by
                    name here, from the record's own parent, and can be moved off
                    it. The remaining refusals belong to the door: a ring, and an
                    account outside the caller's fence. */}
