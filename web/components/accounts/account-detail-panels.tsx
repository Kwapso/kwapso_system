// THE COLLECTION TABS of the account record — the people linked to it, and who
// can sign in to it. There were three; "the accounts sitting under it" went on
// 17 Aug 2026, because it and the Contacts tab were answering the same question
// under two names (CHECKLIST 7.2).
//
// They live beside account-detail.tsx rather than inside it because they are the
// part of that screen that GREW: one 611-line function with seventeen hooks, in
// which the list bodies, their empty states, their per-row actions and their
// confirms were interleaved with the record's own header, dialogs and data
// reads. Each of these is one list, one question.
//
// They own no data and no permissions of their own. Everything they need is
// handed in — the rows the host already fetched, the rights it already resolved,
// and the two verbs below. The host stays the only thing that knows how to read
// or write an account, which is what keeps the record's tabs (R2/R8) and its
// counts (R16) in one place.
