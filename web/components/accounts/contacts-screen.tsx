"use client"

// CONTACTS — every PERSON linked into the customer spine, across every account,
// in one list (client, 31 Aug 2026: "contacts as a real sidebar page, also
// remove the tab from inside accounts"). SAME table, SAME door, SAME
// `contacts:read` gate the Companies/All strip on Accounts already checks —
// this is a second address for rows the app already fetches, not a new
// capability.
//
// ITS OWN FILE, not a branch of `collection-content.tsx`'s big switch — not
// because it needs a hook (it does not; the tab still rides the URL, exactly
// the way `collection-content.tsx`'s own Accounts branch keeps its tab in
// `ctx.query` rather than local state), but because `web/test/rules.test.ts`'s
// "a tab strip is not nested inside another one" census counts how many times
// the TabsView element appears in one file, as its proxy for "one screen" (the
// client's ruling: "there can never be 2 rows of tabs … just never"). Accounts
// and Contacts are two different screens that happen to share one switch
// statement, never rendered together — but the census cannot tell that from
// two DIFFERENT screens simply stacked one after another in the same source
// file. Its own file keeps the census honest without asking for an exemption
// that would not even describe what is actually happening here (nothing is
// nested).
//
// A CONTACT'S ROW OPENS THE SAME RECORD IT ALWAYS DID. An individual account is
// one row of the SAME `accounts` table a company is, so `onIntent` (the
// deep-link host, deep-link-screen.tsx) resolves this list's "open" intent to
// `/accounts/<id>` — never a second address for a record that already has one.
//
// BY COMPANY / ALL — the client's explicit ruling that Contacts "is a min[main]
// screen so will need tabs like any main screen" (31 Aug 2026). The genuine
// distinction already lived here before it had a tab to sit on:
// `ContactsByCompany` is one arrangement of these same rows, and a flat list is
// the other — no second door question, unlike Accounts' own Companies/All
// (which narrows `type`). Both tabs badge the SAME exact total (R16), the same
// shape sprints-screen.tsx uses for its own three views of one collection.
