"use client"

// CONTACTS, UNDER THE COMPANY EACH ONE SITS AT — the Contacts tab of the
// accounts screen, and the only place in the agency app a collection is grouped
// by another record.
//
// The owner asked for it in one line: contacts should be "grouped by company"
// rather than a flat list. The library has no grouped collection — `List` draws
// rows and nothing else, and only `kanban` groups (UI-GAPS #24) — so this is a
// host-composed component, which is the sanctioned shape for a screen the recipe
// engine cannot express. Each group still renders through `ScreenRenderer` on
// the accounts recipe, so a row here is the same row as on the other two tabs:
// same fields, same click-through, same gating. Only the arrangement is ours.
// The pattern is `apps-screen.tsx`'s, deliberately — one card, `<section>` per
// group, a heading above each — because a second way to draw a grouped list is
// a second thing to keep in step.
//
// ── GROUPING A LIST THAT PAGES, AND WHAT WE DECIDED ─────────────────────────
//
// The accounts collection is PAGED (R14): fifty rows at a time, keyset cursor,
// newest first. That makes grouping a trap, because there are two honest
// arrangements and only one of them was available:
//
//   (a) GROUP THE ROWS WE HOLD, and say so. Every contact loaded is filed under
//       her own company, so no row is ever under the wrong heading and no
//       company is ever split in two — the map is built over EVERYTHING loaded,
//       not per page, so pressing "Load more" fills groups in rather than
//       starting new ones. What can be wrong is a group being SHORT: Bergman may
//       have five contacts and two of them loaded. So the screen says that, once,
//       above the groups, and only while there is more to load.
//
//   (b) ASK THE DOOR TO ORDER BY COMPANY, so a company's contacts are contiguous
//       and a group is complete the moment the next one starts. This is the
//       better arrangement and it is NOT AVAILABLE: `ACCOUNT_SORTS`
//       (workers/tenancy/src/lib/accounts.ts) offers name, created, updated,
//       status and code, and none of them is the parent. Adding one is not a
//       line — the sorting seam requires the ORDER BY and the CURSOR KEY to be
//       the same value (shared/workers/sorting.ts, property 2), so ordering by
//       the company's NAME means carrying that name on every account row, which
//       is a new column on a type that crosses the client portal's fence, where
//       a parent's name is not always the caller's to read. Ordering by the
//       parent's ID instead needs no new column and would give contiguity — but
//       the headings would then run in the order the companies were added, under
//       a control labelled "Company", which is the kind of order that reads as
//       broken.
//
// So this is (a), said out loud rather than implied. (b) is worth doing on its
// own, with the door change reviewed as the fence change it is.
//
// THE NAME OF A COMPANY comes from the accounts the team area has already
// loaded — the same map `apps-screen.tsx` names an app's client from, and the
// same one `shape.tsx` writes "under Bergman S.A." with. A company we are not
// holding cannot be named, so those contacts go into one honest trailing group
// rather than several headed with the same vague phrase. Both lines are true;
// one is just more specific, which is the compromise the summary line on these
// very rows already makes.
