"use client"

// THE TWO WAYS A PERSON GETS ONTO A COMPANY'S CONTACTS TAB, side by side because
// they are easy to confuse and one of them used to be the only one.
//
//   ContactLinkDialog   — someone we ALREADY hold is a contact of this company too
//   ContactCreateDialog — a brand new person, created and linked in one go
//
// Both end at the same fact: a link row saying "Marta is a contact of Bergman".
// A person is an account row (SCOPE ch.03: one table for everyone), and the same
// person can be a contact of more than one company — which is exactly what a
// parent pointer cannot say and this link row can. That is why LINKING an
// existing person had to survive: forcing a second Marta because the search did
// not find the first is how an address book rots.
// The link dialog's search runs on the SERVER (the accounts door's own `q`), so a
// team with thousands of people still finds the right one — a client-side filter
// over the first page would quietly hide the rest.
// NEITHER FORM ASKS WHAT KIND OF ACCOUNT IT IS MAKING. A contact is a person, so
// the create half fills `accountType` in as code (account-detail's
// `createContact`), the same ruling of 18 Aug 2026 that took the Type selector
// off the account form. Both are Shared FormShell (R4) + draft (R7).
// The search runs on the SERVER (the accounts door's own `q`), so a team with
// thousands of people still finds the right one — a client-side filter over the
// first page would quietly hide the rest. Shared FormShell (R4) + draft (R7).
// It used to say that with two controls, a search box above a Select, because
// there was no one control that could do both. There is now: `RecordPicker` in
// its server mode IS this pairing, and this dialog was the sketch the app's nine
// other pickers were eventually built from.
