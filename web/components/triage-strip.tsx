"use client"

// THE TRIAGE STRIP — one line above the ticket list: whose week it is, and how
// many requests nobody has read yet (.plans/BUILD-1 §6).
//
// It sits ABOVE the list rather than in a screen of its own because it is not a
// screen's worth of information — it is the sentence a person needs before they
// look at the list, and a page they have to go and open is a page nobody opens.
//
// INTERNAL ONLY. The client portal has no such strip and never will: "a request
// of yours has been sitting untouched for four days" is the service-level promise
// §6 says this feature is explicitly not making. The door it reads refuses a
// client login, so this is defended at the door and not by the component.
