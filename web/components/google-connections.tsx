// GOOGLE CONNECTIONS (Settings) — your own account, four services, one at a time.
//
// It sits beside Access tokens for a reason: both are things a PERSON connects
// to their own account rather than things a team owns, and both hand something
// the power to act as you. The sentence at the top says the part people most
// need to hear — kwapso never uses anybody else's account, and the assistant
// acting for you sees exactly what you see.
//
// WHAT THIS CARD DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: browse your Drive, show your inbox,
// or read your calendar. Those doors exist and the assistant uses them; a screen
// that re-implemented Gmail beside Gmail would be the wrong kind of ambitious.
// This card is about the CONNECTION — is it on, whose account is it, what have
// you shared through it, and who can read that.

 * fence was the only one. It stopped being true the day the transcript hunt
 * added a SECOND fence (`googleNoticeQuery`, workers/content/src/lib/google-api.ts)

 * from any request, and used by exactly one caller, but outside the sentence all
 * the same. The widening was invisible precisely BECAUSE the first fence works:
 * Google's own no-reply addresses are nobody's contact, so nothing about the old
 * rule hinted that a notice could ever be read.
 *
 * A privacy sentence that is 99% true is worse than a longer one that is true,
 * because the person reading it has no way to find the 1%. If a third fence is
