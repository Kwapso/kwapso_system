// THE MEETINGS LIST — every conversation we have had or are about to have, newest first.
//
// ONE COLLECTION, PAGED (R14). A meeting is an event: the rows accumulate with
// ordinary use and none is ever curated away, because a cancelled call in March
// is still the answer to "didn't we speak in March?". So the door hands back a
// page and a cursor, and Load more appends — the same shape Tickets and the
// knowledge base have.
//
// The heading carries the exact server COUNT(*) (R16) because a sidebar page has
// no tab strip to badge; the arbitration context makes sure only one of the two
// ever renders it.
//
// AND IT IS WHERE MEETING PURPOSES ARE REACHED FROM. The taxonomy of why we meet
// used to sit under the Delivery method page; that page went on 17 Aug 2026 with
// its programmes folded onto the sprint type, and a purpose belongs beside the
// meetings list rather than on a rail of its own — it is the vocabulary behind this
// screen, not a second destination.

/* THE "EARLIER NOT LOADED" NOTICE IS GONE, and its absence is the fix.
 *
 * It said: "Earlier meetings haven't been loaded yet, so this month may not be
 * the whole of it", under a calendar drawing whatever the paged prefix happened
 * to hold. That was an honest apology for a real limitation — and the limitation
 * has been removed rather than explained. The calendar asks the DOOR for the
 * month it is showing (`meetingsMonthKey` / `listFetch.meetingsMonth`), so the
 * month on screen IS the whole of it and the sentence would now be false.
 *
 * A caveat left standing over a screen that no longer needs one teaches a person
 * to distrust a correct answer, which costs more than the sentence ever bought.
 */


/** WHAT "ALL" SHOWS (CHECKLIST 9.1: "all, with far more columns"). The two-field
 * list is for scanning; this is the one somebody reads across.
 *
 * SIX COLUMNS, NOT NINE. "Every fact a meeting row can state" was the brief and
 * nine columns was the result — the widest table in either front door, against
 * N1's table budget of six. A table's column header does the labelling, which is
 * why it gets six where a list row gets four; past that the row stops being
 * scannable and becomes something you read, which is what the record is for.
 *
 * The three that went: `Why we met` and `Notes` are prose, and prose in a table
 * cell is a truncated sentence nobody can read either way; `Reference` already
 * rides the record's own eyebrow (D4), so it was the same string in two places.

 * third question*). So a header sends a NAME out of `MEETING_SORTS`, and the two
 * columns the door has no name for — App and Where — draw a plain header. A
 * header that cannot order is honest; one that looks like it can and does not is
 * the defect this whole lane is about.
 *
 * Hand-paired because it is a translation between two vocabularies (a shaped
 * row's column, and the door's menu name); the DIRECTION is not, it is read off
 * `COLLECTION_SORTS` so a header cannot land differently from the picker above
 * it offering the same order. */

 * be attributed to `PagedFind`'s own fiber rather than this screen's, which
 * happens to work only for as long as the same hooks fire in the same order
 * every render — exactly the kind of accident this codebase does not ship. A
 * real, capitalised component gives `useCached` a fiber of its own.

 * THE MONTH ITSELF is its own read for the reason `meetingsMonthKey` explains at

 * does so on mount), so the first render asks for nothing rather than guessing.

 * is already asking of the whole meetings list, forwarded onto this door call

       * THE OWNER, 26 Aug 2026, looking at this corner of the screen: "it is very
       * cluttered everywhere. At the bottom near this 'Bring it in' button, there
       * is too much text. Not well done."
       *
       * He was right, and it was not a typography problem. There were TWO buttons
       * a few pixels apart doing two different things with two different labels
       * ("Bring in the calendar", "Bring it in"), each with its own status line,
       * plus a caption, plus a walk-progress sentence — six pieces of text
       * sprayed across the full width of a 1600px page, none of them framed.
       *
       * There is one act here as far as a person is concerned: bring in what
       * Google knows. The shared control has always been able to do both halves
       * (`scope="both"`), and the only reason this screen kept its own was that
       * the calendar sweep's answer carries two facts this screen shows — how far
       * back the walk has got, and which entries are still beyond the horizon.
       * `onCalendarResult` hands those over, so the second button is gone.
       *
       * The FRAME belongs to the screen and not to the control: on the knowledge
       * heading band the same control is an inline toolbar item, and a bordered
       * card there would be wrong. Here it is the foot of a list, so it gets a
       * card. */}
