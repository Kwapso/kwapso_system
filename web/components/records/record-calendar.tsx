// THE CALENDAR — one component, every calendar screen, and every record on it
// opens.
//
// REBUILT ON THE KIT (30 Aug 2026). UI-GAPS #22's blocker — the library's
// `CalendarView` took no click prop of any kind, so a record on the grid was a
// picture of a record — was fixed upstream in kit v1.2.9: `CalendarViewProps`
// now carries `onSelectDay` / `onSelectEvent` / `onSelectItem`. This file is
// now composed from `CalendarView` (the month grid) and `Agenda` (the day-by-day
// list, itself a thin wrapper over `CalendarView`'s own `agenda` view) rather
// than hand-rolling both — the same reason `role-detail.tsx` reaches for the
// kit's parts instead of drawing its own.
//
// WHY A CELL IS NEVER A BUTTON. The kit makes a day cell a real `<button>` when
// `onSelectDay` is given, wrapping its event chips — and a chip becomes its OWN
// `<button>` when `onSelectEvent` is given, which would nest a button inside a
// button. So this file never sets `onSelectDay`: only entries are clickable,
// exactly as before, and the overflow ("+N more") is composed as one more
// `CalendarEvent` per day rather than a second, unclickable line the kit draws
// on its own — the same "+6 more must open something" reasoning UI-GAPS #22
// raised in the first place.
//
// TWO WAYS TO READ ONE MONTH, unchanged. The GRID is for a desktop, where a
// thousand pixels can hold a month at a glance. The AGENDA is that same month
// as a list, day by day, and it is what a PHONE opens on: a month grid at
// 375px is six rows of cells about three characters wide, which is not
// information. Both open records the same way and both show the same period,
// so flipping between them is a change of shape and never a change of subject.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT. It is not a scheduler: nothing here drags, and
// no record moves by being dropped on a day. A calendar in this app is a way
// IN to records that already have a date; the date itself is changed on the
// record's own form, where it is validated at the door like every other field.
