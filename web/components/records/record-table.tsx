// A TABLE WHOSE COLUMN HEADERS ACTUALLY ORDER IT.
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The library can draw this table; it cannot sort it, and the failure is silent
// in the worst possible way — the header lights up and the rows do not move.
//
// `DataTable` keeps the header's choice in its OWN state and pushes it down to
// `CollectionFrame` as a config prop (`sortBy: sort?.key ?? config.sortBy`). The
// frame seeds its sort from that prop ONCE, at mount — `React.useState(config.sortBy)`
// — and from then on orders by its own state and ignores the prop entirely. So
// the value the header writes is read by nobody. Every column of a `display:
// "table"` recipe is `sortable: true` (the engine hard-codes it), so both tables
// in the agency app drew five and six live-looking controls that changed nothing.
//
// That is worse than having no control: a person who sorts by Deadline and sees
// the rows sit still does not conclude the button is broken, they conclude the
// DATA is wrong. Reported from the deployed build: "the sort actually doesn't
// work… I don't see the order changing, even though I can see that there are
// different values." UI-GAPS #22(b) has the library's half of the fix (a
// `serverSide` + `onSortChange` seam on `DataTable`, the same shape #15 asks for
// about search); this is the host's half, and it is a composition of shipped
// primitives, not a fork — the same category as `paged-find.tsx`,
// `record-picker.tsx` and `record-calendar.tsx`, each of which exists because a
// library component owns a decision the host has to make.
//
// The CHROME is still the library's. `CollectionFrame` keeps doing the search
// box, the facets, the count and the pager exactly as before; the only thing
// taken off it is the ORDER, which it was not doing. The rows are ordered before
// the frame ever sees them, and the frame's own sort stays at its default (`""`),
// so `selectRows` leaves the sequence alone. Filtering and searching preserve
// order, so "sort then narrow" and "narrow then sort" are the same list.
//
// ── A HEADER REPLACES THE ORDER, IT DOES NOT REFINE IT ────────────────────────
//
// The doors order deliberately — tasks come back priority-first, the meetings
// list comes back newest-first — and the question was whether a column header
// should sort WITHIN that or instead of it. It replaces it, and the bug report is the
// argument: what the owner was looking at when he said the sort was broken was
// 80 tasks ascending by deadline with one priority-4 row pinned above them,
// which is exactly what "sort within the door's order" looks like from a chair.
// A column header is an instruction about that column and nothing else.
//
// The default is not lost, it is one press away: asc → desc → off, and "off" is
// the order the door handed us. Both tables behave identically.
//
// ── WHO DECIDES THE ORDER ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The same split SEARCH.md draws for the search box, one control along:
//
//   • BOUNDED (Tasks) — the whole collection is in the browser, so ordering it
//     here is honest and free. Pass no `order` and this owns it.
//   • PAGED (the meetings list's All) — the browser holds page one, so ordering it here
//     would arrange fifty of 254 rows and call the result sorted. Pass the
//     `order` off `<PagedFind>` and a header click becomes a question for the
//     DOOR, landing in its own cache key at page one like every other one.
//     A column the door has no name for carries no `sort` and is not clickable:
//     a plain header is honest, and a live-looking one is what this file exists
//     to stop.
