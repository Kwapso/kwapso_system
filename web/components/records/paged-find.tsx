// FIND — the search box, the filter bar and the SORT a PAGED collection (R14)
// has to wear, and the one place any of the three is answered.
//
// `tabs` + `wrap` + `actions` below are ALSO one of the two general
// mechanisms every main screen's tab strip draws through — see the rule at the
// top of `web/components/deep-link/screen-bits.tsx` for the other half (a
// BOUNDED collection's `folderTabs`) and the shape both must land on. `tabs`
// (a `FolderTabStrip` — config/value/onValueChange, screen-engine/tabs-view.tsx)
// draws ONLY the tab strip, because that is all its shape CAN draw; `actions`
// draws the row's own buttons (New/Import/Export…) at the right of the
// TOOLBAR below it, inside `wrap`'s box — never sharing the tab strip's own
// line (client ruling, 2026-08-31, correcting that same day's earlier fix).
// It used to be `renderAbove`, a `(ctx) => ReactNode` render prop — which
// could just as easily have returned a tab strip WITH a button beside it, the
// exact shape the ruling forbids, and did for a few hours. A spec object with
// no ReactNode parameter cannot.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The library's CollectionFrame searches and filters IN MEMORY,
// over the array it was handed. On a bounded list (members, roles, dropdowns)
// that is exactly right and costs nothing. On a GROWING one it is a lie with a
// straight face: the browser holds page one, so typing "Confia" matched the
// newest fifty accounts and silently answered "no" about every one past the
// cursor — under a badge (R16) correctly counting all of them. Two numbers, both
// true, neither about what the person asked.
//
// So on a paged collection the question goes to the DOOR, which is Layer 2 of
// SEARCH.md and was always where a growing list's search belonged. The frame
// keeps drawing rows; this owns what is asked for. Concretely:
//
//   • the recipe turns its own search box OFF (`listCollection`, paged: true) —
//     one box on the screen, and it is the honest one;
//   • what the person types + picks becomes the door's OWN query parameters, so
//     the answer spans the whole collection rather than the loaded prefix;
//   • the matches land in a cache key of their own, with their own cursor
//     sidecar, so <LoadMore> pages the SEARCH and not the list underneath it;
//   • the exact server total of THAT question renders through `formatSearchTotal`
//     — the one seam in the app allowed to end in a "+" — beside the collection's
//     own R16 badge above, which never moves. A collection total and a filtered
//     total are two different numbers and the screen now says both, each labelled.
//
// AND THE SORT IS THE SAME SENTENCE, arrived at four months later (2026-08-18).
// The library's `selectRows` orders the array the frame is HOLDING, so sorting a
// paged collection orders page one — fifty of 254 tasks, arranged, and nothing on
// the screen saying which fifty. Reported by the owner as "the sort actually
// doesn't work… I don't see the order changing, even though I can see that there
// are different values", which is what it looks like from the outside: a control
// that moves rows around inside a window you cannot see the edges of.
//
// So a sort joins `q` and the facets as an ordinary query parameter, and it gets
// the property that matters for free. A changed sort is a changed QUESTION, so it
// lands in a different cache key — which means page one, a fresh cursor sidecar,
// and a <LoadMore> that pages THIS order. "Changing the sort must reset to page
// one" is therefore structural here rather than something a screen remembers; the
// door's cursor carries its ordering as well (shared/workers/sorting.ts), so even
// a stale one is refused rather than answered.
//
// The DEFAULT sort is deliberately not sent. A screen nobody has touched asks the
// door nothing, reads the collection's own cache key and looks exactly as it did
// before this existed — the sort only becomes a question once somebody asks it.
//
// It is a render-prop rather than a hook so a screen that is still a branch of
// the host's switch (accounts, tickets, the knowledge base) can use it without
// being turned into a component first: hooks cannot be called from inside a
// `module === "…"` branch, and rewriting three screens to fix a search box is
// the kind of change this codebase calls a defect.
