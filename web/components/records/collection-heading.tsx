"use client"

// CollectionHeading (R16 ii) — the count's home on a screen with NO counted tab
// strip. A real <h1> (title from the module registry) with the exact server
// total as a chip, built through the ONE formatCount seam. Scoping counts to
// tabs was the original loophole: a sidebar page renders no tab strip, so those
// screens "obeyed the law" showing no count anywhere. The target list is DERIVED
// from the registry (every section with a countCacheKey whose placement isn't
// "tab") — never hand-listed. And the count never depends on an unrelated
// permission: the heading renders for anyone who can see the screen.
//
// NO GLYPH — client ruling: a main screen's title is text only. It used to
// carry the section's own `CONCEPT_ICON` glyph beside the word; that glyph is
// gone from here (the rail is still where a section's icon lives).
//
// NO EYEBROW — client ruling, 2026-09-03, verbatim: "I want you to remove the
// eyebrow on the title on main screens. Remove that eyebrow, kill it." This
// reverses the 2026-09-01 ruling that put one here (the NAV SECTION word this
// screen's own `TEAM_SECTIONS` entry already carries — Apps → "Build",
// Contacts → "Accounts"), and it is a reversal rather than a refinement: the
// rail already shows that same `NAV_GROUP_LABELS` word above this very
// screen's row, one glance away, so the line above the title was saying a
// second time what the navigation had just said. A main screen's title is now
// the title and its count, and nothing above it. Nothing else read the label
// through this file, so `NAV_GROUP_LABELS` keeps its one real reader, the
// rail in `app-shell.tsx`.
//
// AND NO CONDENSED STAND-IN — same ruling, verbatim: "when I scroll down, the
// whole compressed title is useless, so remove that. When I scroll down, what
// is at the top should be only the tabs, if there are tabs, on the same line
// as the whole eyebrow." `condensed-title.tsx` — the smaller bar that took the
// sticky slot once this heading scrolled away, on both kinds of screen — is
// deleted outright, along with the `IntersectionObserver` that watched this
// heading and the `--collection-tabs-top` clearance it published for the tab
// strip below. What pins at the top of a scrolled main screen is now the tab
// strip and nothing else (`STICKY_FOLDER_TABS`,
// shared/web/screen-engine/tabs-view.tsx, `top-0`); a screen with no tabs pins
// nothing at all. Read "on the same line as the whole eyebrow" as the tabs
// taking the position the eyebrow row used to hold — the same ruling kills the
// eyebrow one sentence earlier, so it cannot also be asking for one.

  // the page's name.
  //
  // This used to `return null` here, and that is how the Sprints screen shipped
  // with no title at all while every screen beside it had one — the owner found
  // it on 30 Aug 2026 and asked the right question: how did this get past rules
  // this strict. It got past them because it OBEYED them. R16 says a collection
  // shows its count exactly once, and deleting the entire heading satisfies that
  // sentence perfectly. Nothing anywhere said a page must have a name, so nothing
  // objected. A check right about what it checks and silent about what matters.
  //
  // So the badge stands down and the heading stays. Every tabbed screen —
  // sprints, tasks, and any other that grows a counted strip — gets its name
  // back, from one change, because they all came here for it.

    /* CLIENT CORRECTION, 2026-08-31, verbatim: "title on main screens still
       way too small! it's currently smaller than in detail screens. makes no
       sense." The reference "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" scale names this step
       outright — display-m / 56 / 500 is "Page title" — and a main screen's
       own title is exactly that role. The earlier pass moved this from h3 (24)
       to h2 (32), which was still one step short of the kit's own named step,
       and a detail screen's title (record-chrome.tsx, now h1/44) was left the
       larger of the two. This closes that gap: display-m is genuinely bigger
       than a record's own h1, matching the client's own stated expectation.
       NOTHING SITS ABOVE IT ANY MORE — the eyebrow row that did until
       2026-09-03 is gone (this file's header), so this heading is a single
