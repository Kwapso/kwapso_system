"use client"

// READING WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE TYPED, IN YOUR OWN LANGUAGE — one hook, one button,
// every screen that shows words a person wrote.
//
// THE LINE, AND WHY THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE IT IS CROSSED. shared/i18n.ts states
// the whole design in two sentences: what WE wrote is translated at build time
// and costs nothing to show, and what a PERSON typed is never translated,
// because those are somebody else's words. Nothing in this file changes that.
// It is the one place a READER may cross the line, for themselves, on purpose,
// by pressing a button — and what comes back is never written to the row. A
// German client's ticket stays a German client's ticket; Aurora simply gets to
// read it.
//
// ONE PRESS IS ONE REQUEST, FOR THE WHOLE SCREEN. The hook takes every piece of
// human-typed text the screen shows — the ticket AND every reply on it, not one
// field — and sends them as one array. A request per paragraph would be the same
// answer at four times the price, and it would make the cost of opening a ticket
// depend on how long the conversation on it got.
//
// AND IT IS PAID FOR ONCE. Every translation lands in a cache keyed by the
// language and the exact words, shared by the whole app for as long as the tab
// is open — so putting the original back and asking again is free, a re-render
// is free, and coming back to the ticket after looking at something else is
// free. Only the first press ever spends anything.
