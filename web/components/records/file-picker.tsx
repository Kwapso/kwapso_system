"use client"

// CHOOSE A FILE — the one upload control, for every form that has one.
//
// It exists because four forms need the same forty lines: read the file, refuse
// one that is too big, send the base64 up, put the URL the server hands back
// into the field, and show what was chosen with a way to take it off again. Four
// copies would be four caps that drift apart and four different sentences for
// the same refusal — and three of those four forms had NO file control at all,
// which is the gap this closes: an article could be uploaded, a certificate, a
// staff photo and a brand asset could only be LINKED, so the piece of paper
// behind them lived somewhere else or nowhere.
//
// It is a CONTROL, not a field: each caller wraps it in its own `<Field>` with
// its own label, because "Photo", "The certificate itself" and "File" are three
// different questions with one answer shape.
//
// WHICH DOOR IT POSTS TO IS THE CALLER'S BUSINESS. Every upload door is gated on
// the module that owns the thing being uploaded (a staff photo needs
// `staff_profiles:create`, a brand asset needs `brand_assets:create`), so this
// control never picks one — it takes the upload as a function and stays a
// picker.
