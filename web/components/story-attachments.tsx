// WHAT A STORY SHOWS FOR ITSELF, ON THE STORY'S OWN SCREEN — the files and links
// somebody put up to say "come and look at this".
//
// THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR (owner, 27 Aug 2026): he attached two screenshots while
// editing a story, the form showed their names, the save succeeded — and the
// files were never visible again anywhere. Nothing was lost: the door answered
// 200, the objects are in the bucket, the rows are in `story_attachments`, and
// `GET /api/content/stories/attachments` returns them correctly. The WRITE half
// was built and the READ half never was. `story-detail.tsx` contained no mention
// of an attachment, and the read door's only caller in the whole app was the
// review dialog — a screen you reach by pressing "Ready for review", which is not
// where anybody goes to look at a screenshot.
//
// IT IS `help-attachments.tsx` ONE RECORD ALONG, deliberately and closely: one
// list for files AND links because "here is the thing I mean" is one act; a file
// is a capability URL (`/media/<key>`) rendered as a plain link, so nothing here
// signs, proxies or re-uploads; deactivate rather than delete, so a removed
// screenshot leaves an audit block behind.
//
// THE ONE REAL DIFFERENCE IS THE RIGHT. A ticket's attachment door gates on
// `help:read`, because the person who raised a request may show you what they
// mean. A story is OURS, and its door gates on `work:edit` — so this panel offers
// the buttons on `work:edit` and not a hair wider. `help-detail.tsx` carries a
// comment recording that exact mistake being made and fixed on its own screen: a
// button drawn on the read right is a button whose every press is a 403.
//
// AND NOW IT IS ALSO WHERE A MISTAKE IS FIXED. Attaching and removing were both
// built and the middle was not, so somebody who put up the wrong document could
// only take it off and put another one on — two acts, two lines of history, and
// a moment where the story carried neither. The pencil renames; the replace
// swaps a file's bytes or a link's address for the right ones. Which of the
// three the door does is decided by what the body carries, so this panel sends
// one call for all three (`updateStoryAttachment`).
//
// AND IT SHOWS WHAT IT HOLDS. A row whose file is a picture draws that picture
// under its name (`AttachmentPreview`, the kit's own media well), shared with
// both ticket panels so a screenshot looks the same wherever it is attached.
// The owner's words: "we do our best to preview them rather than me clicking on
// everything." Four screenshots on one story were four lines of text differing
// only in a timestamp.
//
// UI-RULEBOOK K5: one card around the whole collection, hairline between rows,
// never a box per row.
