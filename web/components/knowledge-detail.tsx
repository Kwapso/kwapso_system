"use client"

// One knowledge source, as a tabbed record: Source / Overview. Source = the
// exact words the assistant reads out of it, where they came from, and the two
// controls that matter — correct it, or take it away. Overview = how it is
// filed, who may use it, how many searchable pieces it became and when it was
// last indexed. Its history is still the GENERIC record feed (R5) and is still
// read here — it is simply not a tab any more: it is reached from the ink
// footer's Latest activity column, on the client's 2026-09-06 ruling, and
// web/components/activity-panel.tsx carries that ruling and the argument.
//
// WHY THE TEXT IS SHOWN IN FULL rather than summarised: this screen is the
// answer to "what does it actually know?", and a summary of the material is a
// different thing from the material. Somebody who reads an answer they disagree
// with comes here to see the words behind it, and then takes them away.
//
// Edit is gated by knowledge:edit; taking a source away by knowledge:delete —
// the same rights the assistant is held to when it is asked to do either.
