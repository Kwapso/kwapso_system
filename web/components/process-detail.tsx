// Process detail — one map at /processes/<id>, as a tabbed record:
// Overview / Steps / Versions / Conversation. Its history is not the last tab
// any more — it is reached from the ink footer's Latest activity column, on the
// client's 2026-09-06 ruling; web/components/activity-panel.tsx carries the
// ruling and the argument. Host-composed, because
// the Steps tab draws an ARITHMETIC no engine block knows about — a baseline, a
// latest, and the subtraction between them — and Versions and the conversation
// are collections with their own actions.
//
// WHAT A TESTER COULD NOT DO HERE, 17 Aug 2026, and what changed:
//
//   "Order is unclear."  The steps were a list of names with times under them
//   and nothing saying what followed what — and every step added from the app
//   went in at position 0, so a person building a map watched it grow BACKWARDS.
//   They are now NUMBERED, in one explicit order, with each step's time beside
//   its number and the total underneath. A sequence a reader cannot follow is
//   not a process map; it is a set.
//
//   "I am missing to see the detail of the old version."  The Versions tab
//   listed that versions existed. It could not open one — the door only ever
//   returned the latest version's steps. A version is now SELECTED (the picker
//   on the Steps tab, or Open on a version row) and read in full: its steps, its
//   times, its order, its total, as they were agreed the day it was cut.
//
// WHY THAT MATTERS MORE THAN THE SCREEN'S SIZE SUGGESTS: these step times are
// what the savings figure on the CLIENT'S OWN PORTAL is computed from (R25). The
// subtraction is first version minus latest, so a reader who cannot inspect both
// sides of it cannot check the number a client is being shown — including the
// steps we REMOVED between the two, which is the largest saving there is and the
// easiest to leave out of a screen.
//
// THE FIGURE IS NOT COMPUTED HERE. It arrives from the door, through the one
// savings seam the value screen and the portal read, so the number on a map and
// the number a client is looking at cannot drift apart. R25's caption ships with
// it, word for word, from the same file as the arithmetic.
//
// THE ONE RULE THIS SCREEN ENFORCES IN ITS UI, because the server enforces it in
// the statement: only the CURRENT version can be edited. A baseline you can edit
// after the fact is a saving anybody can dial up, and every number this build
// produces is a subtraction from that baseline. So older versions are readable
// and nothing more, and the screen says why rather than just greying a button.
//
// Every count is an exact server COUNT(*) through the ONE formatCount seam (R16)
// — never the length of a list the door capped, and the Steps badge counts the
// version being SHOWN, not always today's. Nothing here deletes: a step that
// stops happening keeps its row and its frequency at zero seconds, which is what
// makes the saving for work we removed entirely come out right.

                    It used to be a value in a definition list, one line among

                    that is not doing its job, and a client is reading the number
