// THE COLLECTION HALF of the deep-link host's module-render switch — a module's
// LIST screen, for a route that names no record. Its sibling half (the record
// details) stays in module-content.tsx beside it.
//
// The switch was one 486-line function with fifteen `module === "…"` branches in
// two groups, and it grows by a branch every time a module ships. A collection
// and a record detail are two questions; they are now two files. Nothing had to
// be re-threaded to do it: both halves take the SAME ModuleContentCtx the host
// already builds, so the seam is where the switch always was.
//
// Pure, like the whole switch: it takes the bundle and returns a node. No state,
// no effects — those stay in deep-link-screen.tsx, which owns them.
