// The module-render switch for the deep-link host — "given the fully-resolved
// route, rights and per-module data, render the right screen". Extracted from
// deep-link-screen.tsx (which stays the routing + state + effects + dialogs
// host) so each half reads on its own. Pure: it takes ONE context bundle the
// host builds and returns the screen node; it holds no state of its own.
//
// This file is the DISPATCHER plus the RECORD-DETAIL half: the guards every
// module passes through, the two modules with no permission key of their own
// (import, dropdowns), the team overview, and each `/<module>/<id>` detail. The
// COLLECTION half lives in collection-content.tsx beside it — one switch of
// fifteen branches was two questions wearing one function, and it grew by a
// branch every time a module shipped. Both halves take the same
// ModuleContentCtx, so the split re-threaded nothing.

 * function (brand, purposes) get the door from this line rather than each
 * wiring one, which is the same reason the body itself is shared.
 *
 * NO NOTE COMPOSER HERE, and that is not an oversight. The bespoke details pass
 * `onAddNote` because their footers already draw the field, gated on that
 * module's own create right; this path has never drawn one, and offering to

    // The client, 2026-09-06: "I don't want to have activity as a tab anywhere
    // but on the footer, on top of the dates. On the right column, on Latest
    // Activity, I would like some view or expand or whatever, and this would
    // open a slide-in with all the activity."
    //
    // WHY THIS IS ONE NODE AND NOT THREE. The team overview, a member and an
    // invite read the SAME `/api/tenancy/activity` door under three scopes,
    // resolved once in use-screen-data from what is on screen (`activityScope`,
    // and the key that mirrors it). So there is one feed in view at a time, and
    // one door to draw for it — built here, handed to whichever of the three
    // detail branches below is rendering. Building it inside each branch would
    // be three copies of one decision, which is the shape the Activity tab was
    // in before it was deleted.
    //
    // THIS IS WHAT MAKES THOSE SCREENS PAGEABLE AGAIN (R14). The team feed is
    // the fastest-growing table in the base — every mutation writes a row — and
    // between the tab's removal and this line there was no control anywhere in
    // `web/` that could ask it for page two. `listKey` is the key page one was
    // parked under and `fetchPage` is the one fetcher that spends its cursor;
    // both come from use-screen-data rather than being rebuilt beside the
    // control, so the door can only ever page the feed it is a door to.
    //
    // `<ActivityRail>` DECIDES WHETHER TO DRAW ITSELF, off the same exact
    // server total it would print (R16) — so a scope with no history at all
    // yields nothing here, and the footer keeps the eyebrow it already had.

    // ── THE AGENCY'S OWN HOUSEKEEPING ────────────────────────────────────────
    // The only RECORD details in the app that are pure recipes: each one is the
    // record's own fields, which is exactly the block the engine draws. The
    // bespoke details beside them exist because no engine block draws a ticket's
    // conversation or a map's arithmetic; none of these has that problem, so
    // none of them is a component.
    //
    // They used to be "the record's own fields PLUS its history", a pair of
    // blocks. The history is not a tab any more (client, 2026-09-06), so the
    // pair is a single description block — but the history is still READ, through
    // the GENERIC (table, id) path (R5): the same hook every bespoke detail uses,
    // resolved once in use-screen-data because a render switch full of early
    // returns cannot call a hook, and still shaped into each detail's data.
    //
    // SEPARATE BRANCHES, NOT A TABLE, and that is the law's doing rather than a
    // preference. R8's check counts `resolveRecipe("<x>.detail"` literals and
    // demands one `withTabCounts` per rendered detail — a table that resolved
    // its recipe from a variable was invisible to the count, which means the law
    // could no longer see whether these tabs carried their badge. Code a
    // law cannot read is a law quietly switched off, so the shape it measures is
    // the shape they are written in.
