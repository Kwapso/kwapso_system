 * `/accounts/CONFIA/apps/A1` the module is `apps` and the base became `/apps`.
 * The account was gone before a single link was built, and every link the screen
 * then handed to its panels was already missing it. One hop in, and the trail
 * was one level long again — which is why it looked like nesting worked and then
 * quietly stopped.
 *
 * So the address is DERIVED FROM THE TRAIL, in the one place both the shell and
 * the crumbs read it from. `withRecord: false` gives the COLLECTION the deepest
 * level belongs to, in its context — `/accounts/CONFIA/apps` — which is what a
 * detail screen hands its panels as their base, so the next hop appends rather
