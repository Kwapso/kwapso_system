// THE NAMES OF THE RECORDS YOU CAME IN THROUGH, when no loaded list holds them.
//
// THE OWNER, 24 Aug 2026, on `/accounts/…/apps/…/processes/…`:
//
//   "does it not make sense that all of the breadcrumbs should hold the name of
//    the record of the detail screen which was open, rather than the name of the
//    module? Instead of accounts, it should have shown me Confia and then the app
//    name and then the sprint name or number, whatever."
//
// He is describing the intent the crumbs already had. What they did not have was
// a way to KEEP it. A crumb's name was looked up inside whichever list happened
// to be in cache, so the name was there when the collection was small and gone
// when it was not — silently, with the generic word in its place. On staging that
// day: 131 accounts, a page of fifty, and Confia sitting at row 118. Nothing
// errored. The crumb just said less than it knew, and only on the clients with
// enough history to matter.
//
// So a name is READ when the page did not reach it. Not through a new door — every
// record type already has a by-id read, because a detail screen opened from a
// pasted link has always needed one. This asks the SAME doors, through the live
// registry that already names them, and parks the answers under one key per
// trail so walking back out costs nothing.
//
// WHY IT IS BOUNDED WITHOUT SAYING SO IN A LIMIT: the fan-out is the depth of the
// address, and only the levels no list could name. Two or three reads on a cold
// paste, none at all on a walk in — because walking in means every ancestor's
// list was on screen a moment ago.
