// Small presentational pieces for the deep-link screen — the empty/not-found/
// error states and the "list with a create button above it" wrapper. Extracted
// so the resolver stays focused on routing + data.
//
// ── THE RULE FOR EVERY MAIN/COLLECTION SCREEN (client ruling, 2026-08-31,
// generalised from the Accounts fix the same day; the client's own words:
// "remember this is not for accounts [but] for all. main screens! make sure
// you are not applying fixes to one screen only, but to the rules" — THEN
// CORRECTED, same day, once it had been generalised onto every screen: "never
// align the button with the tabs — that button belongs in the right of the
// toolbar, part of the toolbar!") ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A main screen is: a title, then ONE card holding — top to bottom — a tab
// strip (if the screen genuinely has more than one view; plenty of main
// screens do not, and that is fine), then the toolbar (search / sort /
// filter / view-selector) on its OWN row below the tabs, with any action
// buttons (New/Import/Export) at the FAR RIGHT of THAT row — never sharing
// the tab strip's own line — then the data. Not every screen needs tabs — a
// single-view collection (Stories, Waves, Processes, Roles, Members, Invites,
// the knowledge base, Brand library…) just skips that strip and keeps the
// rest. What is never allowed is a tab strip carrying an action button beside
// it, an action row floating SEPARATE from the toolbar above it, or a toolbar
// sitting outside the card its rows are in.
//
// TWO MECHANISMS DRAW THIS, never a third invented at a call site — and both
// are now STRUCTURALLY unable to draw the shape the client corrected. A tab
// strip is never passed as raw JSX any more (a `React.ReactNode` prop cannot
// enforce "tabs alone" — it happily accepted a button folded in beside them,
// which is exactly what shipped for a few hours on 2026-08-31); it is a
// `FolderTabStrip` (config/value/onValueChange, ./tabs-view), and the slot
// renders `<TabsView>` FROM it. There is nowhere in that shape for a second
// node to hide.
//   • A PAGED collection (R14) uses `<PagedFind>`'s own `tabs` (a
//     `FolderTabStrip`, drawn alone) + `actions` (the row's own buttons, at
//     the right of the toolbar `wrap` boxes with the rows) — paged-find.tsx
//     has the whole shape. Accounts, Tickets and Meetings all draw this way;
//     Contacts draws the tab half with no actions (it has none).
//   • A BOUNDED collection uses THIS file's `SectionWithCreate` with its own
//     `folderTabs` slot (also a `FolderTabStrip`) for the tab strip ALONE —
//     passing `folderTabs` suppresses the header's own create button (see the
//     prop's own doc below) rather than sharing the tabs' row with it, so the
//     call site draws that button itself, in its own `<ToolbarRow>` (this
//     file, below) — a search box plus actions, or — where there genuinely is
//     no search — actions alone, still below the tabs and still inside the
//     card. Apps, Sprints and Tasks all draw this way.
// The next screen that ships a tab strip reaches for one of these two, not a
// third arrangement — and the bounded one's own toolbar reaches for
// `<ToolbarRow>` rather than a hand-written `<div>`, so its actions land
// pinned right by construction instead of by copying the class names right.

 * corners here just like the library demo (UI-GAPS #12, shipped).
 *
 * SUPERSEDED, v1.2.28 — this box used to carry an `attached` prop, kept in
 * full below rather than deleted, same discipline shared/spine.ts uses for an
 * overturned argument:
 *
 * "`attached`: this box sits directly under a FOLDER tab strip
 * (`SectionWithCreate`'s `folderTabs`, on a call site that has NOT flipped to
 * `useKitPanel` — a bespoke body like a month grid or a grouped list that
 * never touches `CollectionFrame`, so it has no toolbar of its own to draw
 * the kit's `relative z-[2]` for it). The kit's own two panels that DO attach
 * to a folder strip — `TabsContent` (tabs/tabs.tsx) and `CollectionFrame`
 * (components/collection-frame/collection-frame.tsx) — both carry `relative
 * z-[2] bg-surface-panel`, the middle number in chapter 24.3's three: below
 * the active tab's `z-3`, above an inactive tab's `z-1`, so an inactive tab
 * is "clipped by the card edge" as ch14 puts it. This box already carries
 * `bg-surface-panel` (`Card`'s own `default` variant) but never
 * `position`/`z-index` — a plain static box paints BELOW any positioned
 * sibling regardless of that sibling's z-index, folder tab strip included,
 * so with no stacking context of its own EVERY tab (inactive ones too)
 * painted in front of it. `attached` is the one class that was missing, not
 * a new colour or a new component.
 *
 * `attached` ALSO ADDED A LITTLE EXTRA HEADROOM AT THE TOP — client ruling,
 * 1 Sep 2026: 'great work in the main screen, however I'd like a bit of "body
 * of the folder" like space between the tab and the scrollable list.' [...]
 * it only gives the fold's own body more air before the first row, the way a
 * real folder's paper has some depth before whatever is filed inside it
 * starts."
 *
 * THE KIT'S OWN FOLDER TAB — the `z-[1]`/`z-[3]` feet this prop was reaching
 * over, and the `--folder-tab-overlap` pull the extra headroom was making
 * room for — is gone (tabs-view.tsx's own header has the client's 2026-09-02
 * ruling that killed it). A line tab draws no positioned feet and overlaps
 * nothing, so nothing below it needs a stacking context to survive them, and
 * "the fold's own body" is a shape this app no longer draws. Both halves of
 * `attached` were reaching over a mechanism that has since been deleted, so
 * the prop went with it rather than being kept as a no-op two call sites
 * would still be passing for no reason — every `CollectionCard` gets the

 *
 * IT EXISTS BECAUSE FOUR SCREENS WROTE IT OUT BY HAND. Apps' own search-and-
 * button row, Sprints' bare button row (twice, Overview and Calendar) and
 * Tasks' bare button row (Calendar) were four near-identical
 * `<div className="flex justify-end">…</div>`s, each one a fresh chance to put
 * the button on the wrong side or forget `flex-wrap` and clip it on a phone.
 * One seam now, so the fifth tab body that needs a bare toolbar reaches for
 * this instead of writing a fifth copy.
 *
 * ONE ROW, ALWAYS (client ruling, 2026-09-01: the toolbar spec Aurora
 * approved that night, generalised the way every toolbar shape here is —
 * "not for one screen only, but the rules"). `search`, then `filters`, then
 * `sort`, then `actions` pinned to the far right — never a second row, and
 * `flex-wrap` on this one is an OVERFLOW fallback for a narrow viewport, not a
 * designed two-tier layout.
 *
 * BEFORE THIS, `filters` DID NOT EXIST HERE — Apps and Sprints each rendered
 * their own `<FilterBar>` as a sibling BELOW this row, which is exactly the
 * client's screenshot: `[Search apps…] [Sort by] [Name ▾]` on one row, and a
 * standalone dashed "Filter" chip floating, disconnected, on a second one.
 * Two call sites is two chances to draw that shape by hand, so it is a slot of
 * this component now, the same way `search` and `actions` already are.
 *
 * `sort` and `view` are wrapped in their own non-growing flex box rather than
 * rendered bare, so a child that asks for `w-full` fills the WRAPPER instead
 * of claiming the rest of this row and pushing `actions` onto a line of its
 * own — the same two-row shape one level down. `filters` is NOT wrapped here,
 * and that is deliberate rather than an omission: `FilterBar`
 * (`shared/web/screen-engine/filter-bar.tsx`) already wraps its own pill in
 * exactly that non-growing box internally, so a wrapper here would add a
 * second identical box round it and buy nothing. See the `{filters}` slot
 * below.
 *
 * FIVE NAMED SLOTS, NOT A HARDCODED ROW. Each is independently optional (a
 * caller with no facets passes no `filters`, exactly as one with no search
 * passes no `search`), and the ORDER is this component's, not the call
 * site's — the same discipline the kit's own contract keeps. `view` was
 * added 2026-09-01, first reached by Apps' Tiles/List switch (apps-screen.tsx)
 * — CH27.13's own order (search, filters, view switcher, actions) is why it
 * sits between `sort` and `actions` rather than anywhere else.
 *
 * `empty` IS A SIXTH SLOT, AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL (R50 — "once again, when
 * empty collection no toolbar at all — fix everywhere and set as a rule",
 * the client's own words, 2026-09-03, about a Time tab whose toolbar had
 * shrunk to a lone floating "+"). R48 already made every OTHER slot here
 * answer "does this collection have rows" — apps-screen.tsx gates `search`/
 * `filters`/`sort`/`view` on `appsQ.data.length > 0` — but `actions` (the
 * create button) kept its own, separate gate, usually just a permission
 * check (`canCreate && <AddButton…/>`), because nothing FORCED it to agree
 * with the other four. It escaped on this exact screen, on Sprints, on
 * Deliverables, on Modules, on the client-org panels, on Wave sprints and on
 * Work logs — seven call sites answering R48's question for search and never
 * asking it for the button beside it. A per-slot convention that only some
 * slots follow is not a rule, so the row itself now asks the one question
 * that matters and answers it for every slot at once: pass the same boolean
 * the search gate already computes — the collection's own RAW row count
 * being zero, before any search or filter narrows it, never "zero results
 * for this question" — and the WHOLE row disappears, the create button
 * included, leaving the collection's own `CollectionEmptyState` (or
 * `SectionWithCreate`'s published action) to carry "Add the first" alone.
 * Required, not optional with a safe default: an optional prop a caller can
 * forget is exactly how the create button kept escaping the search gate
 * next to it. See `web/test/rules.test.ts`'s `empty-toolbar` census and
 * `EMPTY_TOOLBAR_EXEMPT` for the few call sites that answer this
 * differently, each with its own reason on file. */

  // behaviour I want. I want it to look together, so merge this with the
  // main toolbar so that it's one single background or container, more like
  // expand behaviour rather than open-a-new-one behaviour."
  //
  // The column above got the OVERLAY question right (the panel is in normal
  // flow, pushes the collection down, never floats) and got THIS question
  // wrong: the track and the panel were two `bg-background` boxes with a
  // `gap-2` between them — same tone, same fill, visibly separate, which
  // reads as exactly the "second card" she is describing. Two boxes of the
  // identical colour with air between them is not "one piece of furniture"
  // no matter what either one is filled with.
  //
  // THE FIX IS THE SAME SHAPE THE HISTORY ABOVE ALREADY WARNS AGAINST
  // REPEATING, READ THE OTHER WAY ROUND. Pass one's bug was letting the
  // panel's own height feed the TRACK's `rounded-pill` — a shape computed
  // FROM content, which stretched into an oval the moment the content grew
  // tall. The fix here is NOT "put the panel back inside the pill" (that is
  // pass one); it is "give the pill's own fill and radius to the OUTER
  // column instead of the inner row, and pick the radius EXPLICITLY off
  // whether a panel is open — never off how tall anything measures." A
  // radius chosen by `Boolean(toolbarPanel)` cannot stretch: it is one of
  // exactly two fixed values (R31), swapped by a boolean, not computed from
  // a box's own height the way a browser's own `rounded-pill` corner radius
  // is. `rounded-pill` (999px) collapsed, `rounded-[var(--radius)]` (24px,
  // the OTHER of the two radii this codebase allows) expanded — never a
  // third number, and never the two at once.
  //
  // WHAT MOVED: `bg-background` and the radius left the inner row (the
  // "track") and now sit on THIS outer div — the only element that paints a

  // a filled, rounded box nested one level inside another filled, rounded
  // box of the same colour is the double-box shape CLAUDE.md's own

   * SUPERSEDED IN PART, v1.2.28. It was a slot of its own rather than more
   * `aboveCard` for one number: the kit's folder strip pulled itself down by
   * `--folder-tab-overlap` (17.02) so the panel below covered the tabs' cut
   * feet — chapter 14's join, and the whole of why the active tab read as
   * attached — and `aboveCard`'s own `gap-4` column would have left ONE
   * pixel of overlap where seventeen were meant: the tabs floating, their
   * feet showing. That mechanism is gone with the folder shape itself
   * (tabs-view.tsx's header has the client's 2026-09-02 ruling that killed
   * it) — a line tab pulls nothing down and has no feet to hide. The slot
   * still renders in a column of its own, but the SPACE below the strip
   * stopped being this column's business on 2026-09-03: the client ruled that
   * a main screen's tabs must clear their content the way a detail screen's
   * already did, so that gap is `--tab-content-gap`, carried by the strip
   * itself in `renderFolderTabs` and read by a detail screen's
   * `--record-tab-gap` too. One number, one owner, both halves of the app.
   *
   * TABS ALONE — never the row's action buttons beside it, and now that is the
   * SHAPE of the prop, not a rule about how to fill it. An earlier fix the
   * same day (2026-08-31) pulled `show`/`secondary`/`download` in beside this
   * strip, by passing a `ReactNode` that happened to hold both; the client then
   * corrected that: "never align the button with the tabs — that button
   * belongs in the right of the toolbar, part of the toolbar." A `FolderTabStrip`
   * (config/value/onValueChange, ./tabs-view) cannot hold a second thing beside
   * the tabs, because the slot renders `<TabsView>` from it rather than
   * whatever the caller handed over — so passing `folderTabs` now suppresses
   * the header's OWN create button instead of sharing a row with it
   * (`showCreateInHeader` below, exactly the reason `useKitPanel` already
   * suppresses it) — the call site draws that button itself, in its own
   * `<ToolbarRow>` (below), at the right of ITS OWN toolbar, below the tabs and
   * still inside the card (apps-screen.tsx/sprints-screen.tsx/
   * tasks-screen.tsx each do this now). */
