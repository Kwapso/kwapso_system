 * reached it. And by the CHECK, which proves every URL segment that can carry a
 * record id has a line here.
 *
 * IT USED TO BE A RUN OF `if (module === "x")`, and that shape had two failures
 * in it at once when the owner hit it on 24 Aug 2026 at
 * `/accounts/…/apps/…/processes/…`:
 *
 *   "does it not make sense that all of the breadcrumbs should hold the name of
 *    the record of the detail screen which was open, rather than the name of
 *    the module?"
 *
 * `processes` had NO branch, so the deepest crumb resolved to "" and was dropped
 * — the record he was looking at went unnamed. And `accounts` had one, but the
 * accounts list is PAGED at fifty and Confia is row 118 of 131, so the lookup
 * found nothing and the crumb said the generic word "Account" with the client's
 * name on the screen underneath it.
 *
 * Both are the same defect: A NAME THAT DEPENDS ON A LIST HAPPENING TO BE
 * LOADED. So `list` is optional and `resource` is not — every record type can be
 * READ by id, and the loaded list is only ever the fast path. `fallback` is what
 * shows for the instant before that read lands, never the resting state.
 *
 * `idField` is here because a member is found by `userId` and everything else by
 * `id`, which is exactly the kind of detail a hand-written branch gets right
 * once and a new one gets wrong. */
