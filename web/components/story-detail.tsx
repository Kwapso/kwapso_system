"use client"

// STORY DETAIL — one piece of work at /stories/<id>, as a tabbed record:
// Overview / Work logs / Files and links. Its history is not a fourth tab any
// more — it is reached from the ink footer's Latest activity column, on the
// client's 2026-09-06 ruling; web/components/activity-panel.tsx carries the
// ruling and the argument.
//
// A story row in the backlog opened NOTHING before this: the recipe registry
// pointed at a story-detail.tsx that had never been written, so tapping a story
// resolved to "that screen doesn't exist". It is the record the whole work
// engine converges on — the only place an assignee and a due date live, the
// thing time is logged against, and the thing whose closing note becomes what a
// client is eventually told — so it is also where the cross-links belong: up to
// its app, its sprint and the request it answers.
//
// Host-composed: the status STEPPER and the time logged against it are controls
// no engine block draws.
