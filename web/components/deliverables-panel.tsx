// WHAT WE HANDED OVER ON THIS APP (CHECKLIST 8.7) — the handover shelf, as cards.
//
// CARDS AND NOT ROWS, and the rulebook decides it rather than taste: K9 allows a
// card grid exactly where a record carries an image, and a deliverable is one of
// the three things in this app that does. It is also the shape the owner showed
// when he finally said what a deliverable IS — a thumbnail, the kind in small
// caps, a title and a date — so this is his screen, drawn out of our own
// primitives.
//
// IT ASKS THE SERVER ITS OWN QUESTION (`?appId=`), like every other nested
// collection here: the exact total that badges the tab comes back from the same
// call over the same WHERE, so the number above the list and the list itself can
// never be two answers (R16).
//
// THE DOOR GATES; THIS ONLY DECIDES WHAT TO DRAW. Every button below is behind
// the right its own door demands — `deliverables:create` to add, `:edit` to
// correct, `:delete` to archive — and none of them is `processes`, which is what
// lets somebody open the app. A role without the right sees no button instead of
// a button that comes back a 403.
//
// SELF-CONTAINED on purpose: its own read, its own form, its own writes. The app
// record is already a long screen, and a tab that owns its own collection is the
// shape `help-attachments.tsx` and `work-panels.tsx` both settled on.
