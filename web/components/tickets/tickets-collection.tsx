// THE TICKETS SCREEN — one tab strip, one collection, and a triage queue.
//
// It lived inside the deep-link host's collection switch, which was fine while it
// was one strip. CHECKLIST 5.1 added a second ("sub-tabs by TYPE beneath the
// existing All / My / Archived strip") and 5.11 added a queue that is not a
// filter of the list at all, and both needed state of their own — so this is a
// component rather than a branch. The host renders it and hands over the things
// only the host knows: the recipe, the rights, and the two action callbacks.
//
// ── THE REDESIGN, 2026-08-31 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This screen used to stack TWO folder tab strips (CHECKLIST 5.1's own
// description above is the fossil of that: "sub-tabs … beneath the existing …
// strip"). The owner had ruled, 2026-08-28, to keep both rather than move one
// into the toolbar ("there's no way out .. lets' keep 2 tabs but both as the
// folder tabs" — `web/test/rules.test.ts`'s `TWO_STRIPS_OK` carried that
// ruling). The CLIENT overruled it the next business day, verbatim: "there can
// never be 2 rows of tabs, no folder tabs, no line tabs. just never." Not a
// narrower version of the 28 Aug ruling — the opposite of it — so this is a
// genuine redesign, not a spacing fix.
//
// WHAT THE TWO STRIPS WERE ASKING were always two different questions:
//
//   the OLD OUTER strip was WHOSE and WHERE — All tickets / Archived, a raiser-
//   scope-turned-VIEW the door has answered as a server scope since tickets
//   started paging;
//
//   the strip that REMAINS is WHAT KIND and HOW FAR ALONG — Ready, then one tab
//   per live `Ticket type` value, then Closed, then All. DERIVED from the
//   team's own vocabulary rather than hard-coded: deactivating "Bug" on the
//   Dropdown values screen takes its tab away, and adding a word adds one.
//
// THREE SHAPES WERE ON THE TABLE. (a) fold Archived in as one more value on the
// remaining strip — rejected, because Archived is orthogonal to kind/stage (an
// archived ticket can be any type, at any stage) and folding it in as a sibling
// of Ready/Issue/Closed would have made "archived Ready tickets" unreachable,
// a real capability the two stacked strips already gave away. (b) move it to
// the toolbar as a plain control — too vague to be a decision. What shipped is
// closer to (c): Archived becomes a real FILTER (`COLLECTION_FILTERS.help`,
// field `view`), the exact shape Accounts' own "Archived" toggle already uses
// beside its Companies/All tab (`web/lib/collection-filters.ts`) — so scope and
// kind/stage stay two REAL, independently-askable questions, just never drawn
// as two tab strips. A tab and a filter compose for free through
// `<PagedFind>`'s own `query` object (paged-find.tsx), so "archived Ready
// tickets" is still one search away, through the toolbar's Filter control
// rather than a second folder strip.
//
// THE TOOLBAR MOVES INSIDE THE CARD, the other half of the same client note
// (verbatim on a screenshot of THIS screen: the search/sort sat on the base
// background, above the peachy panel holding the rows). Accounts hit the
// identical defect the same day and fixed it the identical way
// (`collection-content.tsx`, `accountTabs`): `<PagedFind>`'s `wrap` boxes the
// toolbar AND the rows in one `CollectionCard`, and the tab strip sits directly
// above it with zero gap. Before v1.2.28 that gap had to stay zero so the
// folder tab's own pulled-down feet (`--folder-tab-overlap`) melted into the
// card rather than showing on the base background; the folder shape is gone
// now (tabs-view.tsx's own header has the client's 2026-09-02 ruling) and the
// flush join is kept on its own merits. Tickets and Accounts draw the same
// join.
//
// THE TOOLBAR GAINS A FILTER AND A CREATE BUTTON, the two pieces the old
// search-and-sort-only bar was missing next to Accounts' fixed one: the
// Archived filter above, and a "Raise ticket" button beside the tab row where
// Accounts' New/Import/Export row sits. There is no Export/Import button here
// because there is no export or import door for tickets (SCOPE ch.07 — a
// ticket is a conversation, not an importable record; `internal-money.ts`'s
// neighbour AGENTIC-IMPORT.md says the same about what earns a target). A
// "view selector" beyond the tab strip and the Archived filter is not drawn
// either. The kit's own `ViewSwitch` (`shared/ui/components/collection-frame/
// view-switch.tsx`) is genuinely reached elsewhere now (Apps' Tiles/List,
// Waves' List/Timeline, 1 Sep 2026) — the reason it stays off THIS screen is
// that a ticket has no second real way to look at the same rows, not that
// the control is unproven. A Board grouped by `status` was analysed and
// flagged as real future work (per-status paged reads, an R16 arbitration
// question), not a "no view exists yet" gap.
//
// Every narrowing is still the DOOR's (R14 + R16). Filtering the loaded page
// would answer "the questions among the newest fifty" while the badge above
// counted all of them, which is the failure R16 exists for and the one a
// manager reported as "filter by type, the count doesn't change".
//
// AND ONE TAB IS STILL NOT A FILTER. "Triage" swaps the collection for the
// queue of requests nobody has read — and the DOOR decides whether this caller
// is given that queue at all (CHECKLIST 5.11: only the person on duty sees
// it). A screen that hid a list it had already been handed would be a
// curtain, not a rule.
