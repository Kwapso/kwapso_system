"use client"

// REPLY BY EMAIL — the two things the owner asked for, in one form.
//
//   "a clear link or a very nice UI when the agent is done, so that I can just
//    click inside of the kwapso app and it takes me to my Gmail"
//   "Or I can just say send it from kwapso and it sends it"
//
// Two doors, and the ORDER of them is the product decision. Writing a draft
// changes nothing outside this building, so it is the plain button. Sending is
// the one act here that leaves — so it sits beside the draft rather than
// replacing it, and it needs the role's own send switch (`google_mail:create`),
// exactly as the assistant does. A switch that bound the assistant and not the
// person clicking the same button would be a switch that means nothing.
//
// ONCE DRAFTED, THE LINK IS THE POINT. The door hands back the Gmail URL of the
// draft it just wrote in the person's OWN mailbox, and this form shows it as a
// real link rather than a toast that disappears — that is the "clear link"
// half of the sentence above. Sending after that sends THAT draft (by its id),
// never a second copy of the same letter into the client's inbox.
//
// It never sends by itself and it never sends what you have not read: the send
// button is disabled while the three fields are incomplete, exactly like the
// draft one.
//
// Library primitives, FormShell, per-session draft (R4 + R7) — and the draft rule
// earns its place here more than almost anywhere: what is typed in is a letter
// to a client, written once.
