"use client"

// ANSWER A TICKET — the second and last thing in the product that emails a
// client (.plans/BUILD-1 §7). Through the shared FormShell (Law R4) with a
// per-session draft (Law R7).
//
// IT OPENS PRE-FILLED, and that is the whole point of the ticket's draft
// resolution: each story's closing note has been appended to it as the work
// finished, so the person answering is editing a paragraph rather than
// composing one at the end of a fortnight. What they send is what they edited —
// the door takes the words as an argument and never reads the draft itself,
// because a draft is our working text and a resolution is a sentence somebody
// chose to say.
//
// The button says what it does. There is no un-sending an email.
