"use client"

// WHAT SOMEBODY ATTACHED TO SHOW WHAT THEY MEAN (CHECKLIST 5.10) — several files
// and several links on one ticket, on the agency's side of the same list the
// client portal draws.
//
// ONE LIST FOR BOTH KINDS, because it is one act. A screenshot and a Loom link
// are the same sentence in a conversation, and splitting them would have made a
// person look in two places for "the thing they sent me".
//
// A FILE IS A CAPABILITY URL (`/media/<key>`, served by both gateways) — the key
// carries a ULID, and the fence on the door is what decides who is ever TOLD the
// key. Rendered as a plain link: nothing here signs, proxies or re-uploads.
//
// A CLIENT MAY NEVER FIX SOMEBODY ELSE'S FILE. Owner's ruling, 27 Aug 2026,
// asked as "may a client login rename or replace a file agency staff attached?"
// and answered in one word: "never." Not on `help:read`, not on any role a
// client login can hold.
//
// IT IS RECORDED HERE BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE THE MISTAKE WOULD BE MADE. The story
// panel one record along has a rename and a replace (`updateStoryAttachment`),
// and copying them onto this panel is the obvious next commit — the two files
// are deliberately twins. The reason it is not a small copy is four lines below
// this one: this panel's write right is `help:read`, which a CLIENT LOGIN HOLDS.
// The story panel's is `work:edit`, which no client can reach. Same shape, and
// the right underneath it is the whole difference.
//
// AND IF IT IS EVER EXTENDED: the fence goes on the DOOR, not here. R21 was
// earned twice by exactly this — the agency gateway forwards `/api/content/*` by
// PREFIX and a client login is an ordinary team member, so a door the portal's
// allow-list withheld was being served to the same person at the other hostname.
// A `canEdit` that renders no button is not a fence; a fence is
// `refusePortalCaller` inside the handler. What a client may still do is
// unchanged: attach their own file, and see what they sent. The line is drawn on
// somebody ELSE'S file, never on their own.
//
// UI-RULEBOOK K5: one card around the whole collection, hairline between rows,
// never a box per row.
