// ONE DROPDOWN VALUE, AS A RECORD (Law R2): Overview + Activity.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. `selectable_data` has been writing activity rows since the day
// it shipped — created, renamed, made a default, deactivated, reactivated, four
// `logActivity` calls in workers/tenancy/src/lib/selectable.ts — and there was
// nowhere to read them. The manager screen is a vocabulary: a flat list of words
// under their group, with a rename box and a row menu. So every one of those
// sentences was written to a feed no screen opened, and "who retired this ticket
// type, and when" was a question the database could answer and the app could
// not. R2's clause is exactly this shape — a record with history and no tabs is
// a record whose history is invisible.
//
// IT READS ONE ROW, NOT THE LIST. `selectableOne` is a single `WHERE id = ?`
// (one D1 round trip); the vocabulary list is a capped read plus an exact
// COUNT(*) (three). Reading the list and finding the row in JavaScript is the
// shape help-detail.tsx still has, and it costs five round trips to answer a
// question about one row — on a cold deep link that is the whole wait before
// first paint. The live layer patches this key by id (web/lib/live-resources.ts
// `selectable_data`), so a teammate's rename moves the open record without a
// refetch, which is the same guarantee the list already had.
