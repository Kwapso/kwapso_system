"use client"

// "Manage choices" — a small link shown beneath a dropdown that jumps to
// Settings → Choices (formerly "Dropdown values"), where you add or edit
// options. Shown ONLY to people who can create or edit dropdown values; a
// read-only member can't act on it, so it stays hidden for them. Your form draft
// survives the navigation (CACHING.md §11), so you can add an option and return to a
// still-filled form.
//
// REPOINTED 2026-09-01, the day Choices moved off the team area's own tab
// strip and into Settings: the old `/t/<teamId>/dropdowns` address still
// resolves (nothing there broke), but this link is exactly the kind of
// "duplicate, orphaned entry point" the move was meant to close, so it now
// opens the one door Settings itself offers — `?tab=choices`, the same
// `initialTab` mechanism the Kwapso screen's own `?tab=` already uses.
