// LOG TIME BY HAND — always available (.plans/BUILD-1 §5), because half of real
// time is remembered rather than clocked. Through the shared FormShell (Law R4)
// with a per-session draft (Law R7).
//
// TWO MOMENTS, NOT A DURATION. The form asks when the work started and when it
// finished, and the server computes the seconds between them. A "how many hours"
// box would be one field fewer and would produce a number nobody can check
// afterwards — "was that Tuesday morning or Tuesday afternoon?" has an answer
// here and none there.
//
// AND IT CORRECTS ONE TOO (`initial`). Every number this app can show about how
// long something took is a sum of these rows, so a mistyped hour is a wrong
// figure on somebody's screen until it is fixed — and until now it could only be
// fixed by asking the assistant. The one thing the correction cannot change is
// WHAT the time was against: the door does not move a row between a story and a
// ticket, so the form shows it as a fact rather than offering a picker that
// would silently do nothing.
