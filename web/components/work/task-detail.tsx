// TASK DETAIL — one piece of the agency's own admin, as a tabbed record (Law R2):
// Overview / Work logs / Activity.
//
// IT USED TO BE A RECIPE, and the note that made it one was true when it was
// written: a task is "a title, a date and a tick", and there was no control on it
// the engine had no block for. That stopped being true on 18 Aug 2026. The owner
// asked for a work logs tab wherever time is tracked, `tasks` has been a work-log
// target since work logs shipped, and a tab whose panel is a list plus three
// charts is exactly the thing no recipe block draws. The engine kept the record
// for as long as it could describe it, which is the deal — a recipe is not a
// prize a screen keeps after it has outgrown one.
//
// WHAT CARRIES OVER UNCHANGED: the same fields the description block showed, the
// same tick-and-untick door through the same `onAction` seam the recipe used, and
// the same generic (table, id) activity feed (R5). The timer on the header is the
// one the recipe already had, moved from the `above` slot to where a record's
// secondary action belongs.
