"use client"

// Write-a-story dialog — one piece of work we do. Through the shared FormShell
// (Law R4) with a per-session draft (Law R7), like every other write in the base.
//
// THE APP COMES FIRST, and that is CHECKLIST 6.1 rather than a layout preference.
// Three of the fields below are NARROWED BY IT: the sprints are that app's, the
// open tickets are that app's, and the processes are that app's maps. Asking for
// the app last meant every one of those pickers offered the whole agency's
// inventory until the very field that could narrow them had been answered. First
// the system, then the work on it.
//
// AND THE EDIT SCREEN IS THIS SCREEN. The owner's standing rule — "any change to
// a form must be reflected in the edit screen unless he says otherwise" — is kept
// here by construction rather than by discipline: there is one dialog, `initial`
// decides whether it is a create or an edit, and both call sites hand it the same
// four option lists. A field added below appears on both, or on neither.
//
// WHAT IS ON IT NOW AND WHAT IS NOT:
//   • a TYPE, required (6.2) — Fix, Feature, Change, editable on the Dropdown
//     values screen. The old note here said a story deliberately had none; the
//     owner reversed that on 17 Aug 2026;
//   • the SPRINT list, narrowed to that app and to blocks still worth putting
//     work into, each carrying its mark (6.3);
//   • "Request behind it" is now TICKETS (6.4), narrowed to that app and to the
//     ones still open — a resolved request is not something to hang new work on;
//   • the PROCESSES this work touches, one or more, with an explicit "it changes
//     none" that has to be TICKED rather than left blank (6.5, Aurora's ts4);
//   • NO DUE DATE. A story is due when the block it was sold inside is due (3.15).
