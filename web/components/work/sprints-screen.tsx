"use client"

// SPRINTS — the blocks of delivery work sold, each covering one app for one
// account. Its own section now (the owner's ruling), where it used to be a strip
// under the backlog: completing a sprint is what cuts a version of every process
// map beneath it, and a consequence that size should not live in somebody's
// peripheral vision.
//
// Completing and reopening live on the SPRINT'S OWN SCREEN rather than as a
// button on every row here — one deliberate place for a deliberate act.
//
// ── THREE VIEWS, ONE READ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Overview, Calendar, All sprints. They are NOT three server piles the way the
// tasks screen's six are, and the difference is the collection rather than a
// preference: a sprint is a contract, so this list is BOUNDED and read whole
// (R14), and all three views are three arrangements of the one array already in
// hand. Nothing here fetches a second time.
//
// Which is also why all three tabs carry the SAME badge — the door's exact
// COUNT(*) for the collection (R16). A sprint does not stop existing because
// somebody opened a month grid, and a badge counted off the rows a view happened
// to draw would be a loaded length wearing a total's clothes.
