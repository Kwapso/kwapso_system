// TIME — the week as it actually went, and the two ways of adding to it.
//
// TWO PIECES, because they belong in two places. `StartTimerStrip` is the one
// click and the Monday-morning question, and it sits beside the WORK (the
// Stories page): starting a timer is something you do while looking at what you
// are about to do, and "you left this running since Friday" is something you
// need answered wherever you happen to be. `TimePanel` is the TIMESHEET — what
// has already been logged, the manual entry that is "always available" because
// half of real time is remembered rather than clocked, and the correction — and
// that belongs on a page of its own.
//
// It did not have one. The whole list lived under the backlog at the foot of the
// Stories page, which is how a tester with 115 logged entries came to report
// that she could not find logged time at all. See the `time` section in
// lib/pages.ts.
//
// ONE CLICK IS THE ACCEPTANCE BAR (.plans/BUILD-1 §5). The RUNAWAY prompt is not
// in the header for a reason: the header's job is a glance, and "what do you
// want done about it?" is a question with three answers.
