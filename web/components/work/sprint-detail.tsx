// SPRINT DETAIL — one block of sold work at /sprints/<id>, as a tabbed record
// (Law R2): Overview / Stories / Activity.
//
// COMPLETING A SPRINT LIVES HERE, deliberately and nowhere else. It is not a
// status word: it is the moment that cuts a version of every process map beneath
// it, which is what every savings figure afterwards is subtracted from. A
// consequence that size gets a button on the record's own screen with a sentence
// beside it, never a control in a row's overflow menu.
//
// Host-composed: the Stories tab is a collection with its own create action, and
// no engine block draws it.
