"use client"

// TASKS — the agency's own admin, and beside it what we are waiting on clients
// for. Two collections on one screen, and the pairing is the point: they are the
// same shape and opposite audiences, so showing them together is what stops
// somebody raising the wrong one. "Ours to do" is the list; "waiting on them" is
// the panel under it, which is the only place in the agency app that writes a row
// a client will read — so its button says so.
//
// A to-do gets no section of its own for the same reason meeting purposes get
// none: it is the other half of one idea, and a rail that lists both halves reads
// as two ideas.
//
// ── SIX VIEWS, ONE READ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Overdue, List, Calendar, Completed, Upcoming, All — the tester's own order, and
// every one of them a SERVER view (R14/R16): the list is capped, so sieving the
// loaded rows for the overdue ones would show "the overdue among the newest N"
// under a badge counting all of them. Whichever tab is open fetches its own pile,
// and every OTHER tab's count comes back with it, which is why six badges cost
// one request and not six.

 * compared as text puts April before December before January, the rows move,
 * the arrow lights, and the screen looks exactly like one that worked.
 *
 * Each entry says two things (record-table.tsx's `SortType` note has the long
 * version): WHICH VALUE to compare — the raw fact `shapeTasks` carries beside
 * the shaped cell, never the cell — and HOW to compare it.
 *
 * A column absent from here compares its own text, on purpose: `name`, `app`,
 * `assignee`, `important` and `urgent` are words, and their cell IS the fact.
 *
 * Spread onto the columns at the one place they are built, below, so a column
 * cannot be added to `EVERYDAY_COLUMNS`/`COMPLETED_COLUMNS` and reach the table
 * by a route that skips this. `web/test/sorted-columns-declare-their-type.test.ts`

                absolutely everywhere we have a data view or a collection
                view. Stop hardcoding this." `RecordCalendar` still never

                collection body), so it still cannot inherit the other five
                tabs' engine-drawn search — but that is a reason this row
                needs its OWN search box, not a reason to have none. See
