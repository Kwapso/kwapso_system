"use client"

// SELL A WAVE — the form overlay for recording a package a client bought, or
// re-wording one. Through the shared FormShell (R4) with a per-session draft
// (R7), like every other write in the base.
//
// TWO FIELDS AND NO THIRD, and each absence is a ruling rather than an omission:
//
//   • NO PRICE. The owner took the money out of the first version four separate
//     times — "leave the whole internal_rates and account_rates out of V1… This
//     is a fix decision" — and there is no price column on `waves` for a field
//     here to write to. A form that asked would be asking for something no door
//     accepts.
//
//   • NO KIND. "A wave consists of multiple sprints. Sprints consist of multiple
//     stories… It makes no sense to label a wave as a particular kind. A wave is
//     a wave."
//
//   • NO DATES. They are the sprints' answer (the wave's own screen recalculates
//     them whenever a sprint is added, moved or removed), so a pair of date
//     inputs here would let somebody type a wave into disagreeing with the work
//     inside it — and the disagreement would look exactly like a fact.
