// FINDING A WAVE — the one search, filter and sort, wherever waves are listed.
//
// WHY THIS IS A FILE RATHER THAN A TOOLBAR ON THE WAVES PAGE. Waves are listed
// in two places and will be listed in more: the sidebar collection, and the
// client's own record. A screen that grew its own search box would give the
// second list a different vocabulary from the first — a different placeholder,
// a different sort, "Switched off" spelled two ways — which is the drift the
// glossary law exists to stop and which no law catches inside a component.
//
// CLIENT-SIDE, DELIBERATELY, AND THE REASON IS R14.
// A wave is something the agency SELLS. The collection grows at the speed of
// contracts, not of clicks, so the door reads it WHOLE under a hard cap and
// there is no page two to be wrong about. That makes filtering in the browser
// the honest shape here: everything that can match is already in front of us.
// The moment waves are paged (they are not, and would not be for years) this
// has to move to the door, for the reason paged-find.tsx spells out — a filter
// over page one answers "the open ones among the first fifty", which is a
// different and worse sentence.
//
// SELECTION IS A PURE FUNCTION so it can be tested without a screen, and the
// toolbar below is only the controls that feed it.
