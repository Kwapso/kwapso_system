"use client"

// WAVES — the sidebar page: every package a client bought.
//
// A WAVE IS WHAT A CLIENT BOUGHT: a package of sprints. The owner's example is
// the whole definition — "Alex sells Hogo a package — he maps their processes,
// builds two automations, they test it, he trains them. Three weeks later he
// sells a second, identical package." Two waves, told apart by their name and
// their dates.
//
// WHAT A ROW SAYS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. Whose it is, what it is
// called, when it runs and how many sprints are in it. No price: the owner ruled
// the money out of the first version, and there is no price column on the table
// for a row to read. No kind either — "a wave is a wave".
//
// THE DATES ARE THE SPRINTS' ANSWER. They are stored on the row and recalculated
// by the door whenever a sprint is added, moved or removed, so this screen reads
// them like any other column rather than working them out — which is what keeps
// a list of forty waves one round trip instead of eighty.
//
// Host-composed rather than a recipe, for the same reason the client's own
// organisation panel is: a row here pairs a date range with a count and an
// inline switch-off, and no engine block draws that.
