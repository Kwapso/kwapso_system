// TIME — the destination a work log never had.
//
// A row of time is what every figure in this app is eventually built on, and
// until this page there was nowhere to go and look at one. The list lived in a
// panel at the FOOT of the Stories page, under the backlog, and a story's Time
// tab showed the few logged against that story. Both are the right place for
// what they do — a Start button belongs beside the work, and a story's hours
// belong on the story — and neither is where a person goes to find "the time I
// logged". A tester with 115 entries reported she could not find any of it.
//
// The screen is thin on purpose: the timesheet is one panel that already existed
// and already followed the rules, so this is a heading, a count and that panel.
// Its recipe would be a list of rows whose only control is a correction dialog,
// which is a screen the engine has no block for — the same reason the story
// detail is host-composed.
