"use client"

// Ticket form dialog — raise a NEW ticket, or EDIT one (when `initial` is present).
// Description is required; Type is an optional DROPDOWN drawn from the team's
// "Ticket type" dropdown values (selectable_data). Every member can see every ticket
// (the My/All tabs are just a raiser filter), so there's no audience picker.
// Library primitives.
//
// WHO IT IS FOR. A staff ticket may NAME the client it is raised on behalf of, and
// that is the field this form was missing: the door has accepted `accountId` from a
// staff caller since the customer spine landed, and the machine surface has offered
// it all along (`create_help_ticket`, whose own note says that without it "a machine
// can only raise tickets that no client will ever see") — while the screen offered
// no way to say it at all. So every ticket typed in the agency app belonged to
// nobody, and never appeared in the portal of the company that asked for it.
//
// It is SET ONCE. A ticket that already carries a client cannot be moved to another
// (lib/help.ts `updateTicket` refuses with `account_fixed`), because moving it would
// hand a conversation, replies and all, to strangers. So on a ticket that already
// has one the picker is replaced by the client's name — the same shape the sprint
// form uses for a fixed app, and for the same reason: a control that can only be
// refused should not be a control.
//
// A PORTAL caller never reaches this form. Theirs is web-portal's own
// raise-ticket-dialog, which has no picker and needs none — `createTicket` takes a
// client's account from the guard corridor and never consults the body.
