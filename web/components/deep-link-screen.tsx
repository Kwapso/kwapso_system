"use client"

// The deep-link resolver — ONE static shell backs the whole /t/* tree. It reads
// /t/<teamId>/<module>/<id>?panel|confirm from the URL (client-side — static
// export can't prerender ids), switches to that team if the link came from
// elsewhere, fetches each module's data + the caller's rights through the
// permission-checked endpoints, shapes it for the recipe, and renders the
// library ScreenRenderer. The engine emits open/close intents and named actions;
// the host maps intents to URL changes and dispatches actions to the API.
//
// This file is the SPINE — where are we, whose team is it, what did we load, and
// what does the screen look like. The parts each live next door, so you can open
// the one you need:
//   deep-link/use-host-nav      the URL: read it, and change it without a reload
//   deep-link/use-route-team    which team the screen runs against, and may you
//   deep-link/use-trace-ring    the assistant's "here's what I changed" glance
//   deep-link/crumbs            the breadcrumb trail
//   deep-link/module-content    the render half — which screen for which module
//   deep-link/write-panels      the write half — the ?panel / ?confirm dialogs
//
// Write UI is URL-driven (?panel / ?confirm) so Back closes it and links are
// shareable; it reuses the existing tested dialogs. The role permission grid has
// no engine block, so its detail is host-composed (role-detail.tsx).

  // constantly, so she pays that price a dozen times a day.
  //
  // Three lines here, because the architecture had already done the hard part.
  // This shell mounts ONCE (R37), so there is somewhere for a memory to live;
  // nesting already lives in the URL (`trailPath` above), so the whole trail is
  // one string; and the per-screen state — the open tab, the search box, the
  // filters — reaches its own screen through a context rather than being
  // threaded down. `web/lib/nav-memory.ts` holds the store, its ceilings and the
  // reasoning about both.
  //
  // NOTHING HERE REDIRECTS. This records the address it is given and hands the
  // screen its own memory back; it never rewrites where somebody asked to go.
  // That is what keeps a deep link pasted from outside sacred (a pasted link
  // arrives in a NEW document, where this store is empty anyway) and it is why
  // the recall lives on the rail, where a person clicks a SECTION rather than a
  // destination — see `app-shell.tsx`.
  //
  // THE ADDRESS THE MEMORY IS KEYED BY is the path plus the ONE query parameter
  // that is a screen state rather than a dialog. `?tab=` genuinely names a
  // different collection on the accounts screen (companies · contacts · all);

  // restored it dropped the condition rather than correcting it, so the SAME
  // trail now drew on a screen with no record open too: the client's next
  // screenshot was the Sprints COLLECTION with a bar reading nothing but
  // "Sprints" — above a screen whose own title already says "Sprints" and a
  // sidebar that already shows the section. His words: "kill breadcrumbs in
  // main screens!" — the SHELL.md line this whole override answers to is "a
  // main screen is in the navbar; a detail screen has breadcrumbs."
  //
  // OVERTURNED 2026-09-03, AND THE OBJECT IT REFUSED NO LONGER EXISTS.
  // The ruling above killed a TEXT BREADCRUMB BAR that sat above the content
  // and repeated the sidebar in words. That bar is gone. What sits there now
  // is the card's own folder tab: the trail is drawn as a strip of folder
  // tabs whose LAST tab is filled with the card's own paper and joined to it,
  // so the tab is not a sign pointing at the card — it is the card's edge,
  // the way a tab on a paper folder is part of the folder.
  //
  // Aurora, shown that exact case drawn (a top-level collection with one tab
  // reading "Apps" over a card titled "Apps"): "On a top-level collection, we
  // would only have one tab, and that's correct. There would be nothing on
  // the left. That's correct." Said twice, of a mockup, after being told in
  // as many words that every top-level screen would gain a tab it does not
  // have today.
  //
  // SO EVERY SCREEN CARRIES ITS TRAIL, and a top-level one carries a trail of
  // one. The old ruling's own test in `web/test/nested-routes.test.ts` moves
  // with it. Its author's objection — that a crumb repeated what the sidebar
  // already said — is recorded rather than deleted, because it still applies

              The key is the SCREEN's identity, not the URL: a `?tab=` inside one
              screen swaps a panel, and `motion-panel-in` (the tight 4px rise) is
              what a panel takes. Remounting on a query change would also throw

              trade in both directions.
