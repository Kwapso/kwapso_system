// THE ACTIVITY PANEL (R14) — one record's history: the feed, its three
// registers, the note composer, and the pager under all of it.
//
// WHERE IT IS DRAWN, AND WHY IT MOVED. It was the body of the Activity TAB that
// every record detail carried. There is no such tab anywhere in the app any
// more. The client, 2026-09-06, verbatim: "I don't want to have activity as a
// tab anywhere but on the footer, on top of the dates. On the right column, on
// Latest Activity, I would like some view or expand or whatever, and this would
// open a slide-in with all the activity." Restated as a ruling on 2026-09-07:
// "record activity — implement 'A · in the eyebrow row' across the app. kill all
// old activity tabs."
//
// So the history is reached from the ink footer's own Latest activity column —
// the summary that was already there, beside the dates — and the whole feed
// opens in a slide-in off it. This component is what goes INSIDE that slide-in;
// the rail itself is the design kit's, and is wired in a later pass. Nothing
// about the panel changed for the move: same feed, same registers, same
// composer, same pager, same `useRecordActivity` read behind it
// (web/lib/use-record-activity.ts, which every detail still calls for the footer
// column and the composer). A tab was a PLACE, not the thing.
//
// R14 IS WHY THE PAGER IS IN HERE AND NOT BESIDE IT. A feed shown under a count
// of the WHOLE history must be able to REACH all of it — page one, then Load
// more — because a record with 143 events showing its newest 50, forever, under
// the number 143, is the exact bug that clause was written for. The count now
// rides the footer's own column rather than a tab badge, and the reachability
// argument is unchanged by that: it is about the feed, not about the label
// above it.
//
// That sentence used to be spelled out in ten detail components, comment and
// all. Ten copies of "the badge counts more than the feed can reach" is ten
// chances for the eleventh detail to ship with a feed and no way to page it. It
// lives here, once — which is also why the thirteen details now carry a
// one-line pointer back to this file rather than thirteen copies of the ruling
// above.
//
// THE COMPOSER (2026-08-31). The client, reviewing CH27.8's add-a-note field on
// the kit's ink footer: "same on activity tab, i want to be able to write
// (replicate what's in footer)". The tab that request named is gone (above), and
// the request itself survives it word for word: wherever the whole feed is
// shown, you can write into it, not only in the footer's summary. `onAddNote` is
// the SAME function each caller
// already built for `RecordScreen`'s footer (`activity.addNote`, gated behind
// that module's own `can(module, "create")`) — passed here a second time, never
// recomputed, so the two composers can never disagree about who may write. The
// field itself is the kit's own `Input`, styled and wired exactly as
// record-detail.tsx draws it in the footer's Latest-activity column (Enter
// submits, the field clears, the placeholder doubles as the accessible name):
// same element, same behaviour, a second place it is drawn. A caller that omits
// `onAddNote` gets no field at all, the same rule `RecordScreen` already applies
// — never a disabled one, which would show an affordance a viewer cannot use.
