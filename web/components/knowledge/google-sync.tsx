"use client"

// THE SYNC AFFORDANCE — one component, on every screen that shows material that
// came from Google.
//
// THE OWNER, ON THE MEETINGS BUTTON: "I like… bringing in the Meetings button on
// the meeting space to sync… we should have this button everywhere, wherever
// we're showing data coming from Google sources."
//
// Before this there were two, and they did two different things. Settings had
// "Bring it in", which sweeps a person's Google material into the knowledge
// base; Meetings had a calendar sync, which brings calendar events into Meetings.
// Every other screen showing Google material — the knowledge base's own sources,
// a client's meetings tab — had nothing at all, so the only way to know whether
// what you were reading was current was to go to another page and press
// something.
//
// ONE COMPONENT, NOT ONE PER SCREEN, and the reason is not tidiness: the STATE a
// person needs is the same everywhere ("when was this last brought in, and is
// anything wrong with it?"), and a second implementation is a second place for
// that sentence to be phrased differently or to go stale.
//
// WHAT IT SAYS, AND WHY EACH PART IS THERE:
//   • WHEN IT LAST RAN, in words. Without it the button is an act of faith —
//     a person presses it, sees "nothing new", and has no way to tell that from
//     "it has been failing since Tuesday".
//   • WHAT WENT WRONG, when something did. The kind's own sentence, not a
//     generic one: "connect it again in Settings" is actionable where "couldn't
//     read your Google material" is not (R12 records it on the row; the door
//     hands it back per kind).
//   • THE HONEST NOTHING. "Nothing new to bring in" is a real answer and the
//     most common one. A control that only ever reports success when it found
//     something teaches people to distrust it.
//
// THE PRESS ALWAYS ASKS GOOGLE. The automatic catch-up sends `onlyIfStale` and
// is politely refused inside the door's five-minute floor; a person pressing a
// button is a deliberate act with an expected result, so it does not
// (lib/knowledge-google.ts's `sweepGoogle` argues that at length). It then tells
// the automatic caller it has just run, so the two do not immediately repeat
// each other.
