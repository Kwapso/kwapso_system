"use client"

// SHARE A DRIVE FOLDER OR A CHAT SPACE — and say, in the same breath, who will
// be able to read it.
//
// This form exists because of one finding. Asked whether a colleague could get
// an answer built from a document in YOUR Drive, the right answer is "only if
// you filed it as team material" — and the note beside it was that the
// team/private shelf is invisible today, so whatever we build "must say, at the
// moment of connecting a folder, who will be able to read it". So the shelf is
// not a setting somebody finds later on a row: it is the second field of the
// form that shares the thing, it defaults to `private`, and each choice is
// spelled out in a sentence rather than a word.
//
// THE THIRD FIELD IS THE SAME ARGUMENT, ONE STEP ALONG: whose material is in it.
// A folder's contents become knowledge-base sources, and every source is filed in
// a COMPARTMENT — one client's, or the agency's own. That could have been guessed
// by matching client names inside the documents; guessing it is precisely the
// failure the compartment idea exists to prevent, because a document filed under
// the wrong client is worse than one filed under nobody: the assistant will quote
// it confidently at the wrong person. The person naming the folder knows. So the
// form asks, here, beside the question about who may read it — the two decisions
// that cannot be read back off the contents afterwards.
//
// AND IT SHARES SEVERAL AT ONCE. The owner: "can you make it so that I can
// select multiple spaces, multiple folders, and multiple files at once?" The
// three decisions this form exists for — who may read it, whose material it is,
// and what kind of thing it is — are the SAME answer for everything picked in
// one sitting, which is exactly why one form with a multi-select is the right
// shape and not merely a faster one. Somebody sharing four client folders was
// answering the same two questions four times, and the fourth answer is the one
// that gets rushed.
//
// DRIVE ASKS ONE MORE QUESTION FIRST: a folder, or a file? The owner again —
// "In Drive, why is it that it's only folder-wise? What if it had to be
// file-wise, or does that file have to be in a folder?" It did not have to. It
// is a choice above the search box rather than a mode on each result, because it
// changes what the search LOOKS IN, and a person who has picked two folders and
// then switches to files has changed their mind about what they are doing.
//
// Through the shared FormShell (Law R4) with a per-session draft (Law R7) — a
// half-answered "who may read this" must not be lost to a mis-tap and guessed
// at the second time.
