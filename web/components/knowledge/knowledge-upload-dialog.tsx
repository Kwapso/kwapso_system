"use client"

// UPLOAD A FILE INTO THE KNOWLEDGE BASE — the third way in, as a person meets it.
//
// It is a separate dialog from `knowledge-form-dialog` even though the two share
// three fields, and the reason is the one sentence at the top of each: that one
// asks "what should the assistant know?", this one asks "which file?". Folding a
// file picker into the typed-note form would make the most common act on that
// form (writing a sentence) share a screen with the least common one, and would
// leave a form where two different things are the material.
//
// WHY IT DOES NOT USE `FilePicker`. That control's contract is "post the bytes,
// hand back a URL" — an upload door that answers with a link, which the form
// then saves in a second call. This door writes the FILE AND THE ROW IN ONE
// CALL on purpose (see the route's header: two calls would leave an orphan in
// the bucket every time somebody closed the tab in between). So the file is held
// here, in the form, until Save — which is also why the drop zone is written out
// rather than borrowed.
//
// THE DRAFT KEEPS THE WORDS, NOT THE FILE (R7). A File cannot go into session
// storage, so what survives navigating away is the title and the filing — and
// the form says the file has to be chosen again rather than pretending it is
// still there. FormShell + useFormDraft, like every other form (R4 + R7).
