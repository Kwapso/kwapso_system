"use client"

// Knowledge-source form — write something into the knowledge base, or correct
// what is already there. The whole point of the module in one dialog: the owner
// asked for a base a person can "add to, correct, and remove something wrong
// from", and a source list you can only watch is not that.
//
// TWO FIELDS THAT ARE NOT ABOUT THE TEXT, and they are the interesting ones:
//   • FILED UNDER — which client's compartment this belongs to, or the agency's.
//     A picker over accounts the caller can already see, because a compartment
//     built from an id nobody owns is a slice nothing can ever reach again.
//   • WHO CAN USE IT — the team, the people on one app, or only you. Two fences
//     behind one question: `owner_user_id` (the one a personal Google connection
//     lands on — material that arrived through what YOU can see stays in YOUR
//     answers) and `visible_to_app_id`, which borrows the app record's own rule
//     that only its staff and an admin may open it (12.3 + 8.11). Picking an app
//     you are not on is refused by the door, in words, rather than quietly
//     filing something you would be the first person unable to read.
//
// A MIRRORED source (one the sweep keeps in step with a ticket, an article or an
// account) hands `textOwnedElsewhere` in, and the two text fields go read-only
// with the reason said out loud — the sweep would overwrite an edit on its next
// pass, and a form that silently loses your typing is worse than one that says
// it will. Library primitives, FormShell, per-session draft (R4 + R7).
