"use client"

// WHO OWNS THIS SYSTEM, both sides, on a tab of its own.
//
// It was two fields on the Overview — "Who is on it" and "Their contacts" —
// each a comma-joined sentence: "Alaap K, Alexander Stadlmair, Aurora Thalassa"
// and "Paras Maroo (main), Petya Bletsova". Three things were wrong with that
// and only one of them is cosmetic:
//
//   • you could not CLICK a person. The record for the human you needed to ask
//     about this system was one search away, from a screen that already knew
//     their id;
//   • the two SIDES were told apart only by which label the sentence sat under,
//     so "ours" and "theirs" read as one list if you skimmed;
//   • and the MAIN one on each side — the person who hears back when a ticket is
//     answered, and the one who marks work done — was a parenthesis inside prose.
//
// TWO GROUPS, ONE LIST EACH, and deliberately not one merged list with a column
// saying which side somebody is on. "Who at the agency" and "who at the client"
// are two questions a person asks separately, and the answer to one is never
// improved by having the other interleaved with it.
//
// THE MAIN PERSON IS A BADGE, not an ordering and not a parenthesis: the door
// already returns each side main-first, so the order carries it once and the
// badge says it out loud for anybody scanning rather than reading.
