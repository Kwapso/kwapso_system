"use client"

// APP DETAIL — one system at /apps/<id>, as a tabbed record: Overview /
// Sprints / Stories / Process maps. Its history is not the last tab any more —
// it is reached from the ink footer's Latest activity column, on the client's
// 2026-09-06 ruling; web/components/records/activity-panel.tsx carries the ruling and
// the argument.
//
// THIS SCREEN IS THE CROSS-LINK the owner named as mattering more than any single
// path: from an app to its account, from an app to its other stories. So the
// header says whose it is (a link, one tap to the account) and three of the tabs
// are the work hanging off it — each asked of the SERVER by `appId`, never
// narrowed in the browser, because the backlog is paged and "this app's work
// among the newest fifty" is an answer that looks like an answer.
//
// Host-composed, because those three tabs are collections with their own actions
// and no engine block draws them. Every count is an exact server COUNT(*) through
// the one formatCount seam (R16).

  // same class of reason: a link that lands one tab away from what it named is a
  // link that makes the reader hunt.
  //
  // WHY A MODULE'S LINK POINTS HERE AT ALL. The client ruled that the four facts
  // under a triage card — client, app, module and author — are all LINKS she can
  // navigate from. Three of the four already had an address. A MODULE HAS NONE:
  // there is no `modules` segment in `TEAM_SECTIONS`, no `modules.detail`
  // recipe, no branch in `module-content.tsx`, and `relationship-map.tsx`'s own
  // `RECORD_PATH` deliberately has no `app_modules` entry — a module is a
  // division OF an app, and the only screen it has ever appeared on is this
  // record's Modules tab (`ModulesPanel`, below). Inventing a `/modules/<id>`
  // URL to satisfy one link would have been a whole screen nobody asked for; the
  // honest destination is the place the module actually is, and that place is a
  // tab. So the tab got an address rather than the module getting a screen.
  //
  // AND A LINK BEATS THE MEMORY, which is `account-detail.tsx`'s own sentence
  // and the reason this is not simply an initial value: an address that NAMES a
  // tab is somebody telling us where to go, so the per-record memory does not
  // get to argue with it — the third argument to `useRemembered` refuses the
  // remembered value outright whenever the URL asked for one.
