"use client"

// Record-an-app dialog — the system we built, the thing with its own address.
//
// The ACCOUNT is written once and never edited: moving an app to another client
// would silently republish its whole map, its savings and its conversation into
// somebody else's portal, so there is no move-app door and this is the only
// place it is decided.
//
// TWO FIELDS THIS FORM NO LONGER ASKS FOR, and the difference between them.
// The owner's ruling of 17 Aug 2026 took the ADDRESS off the form — an app's URL
// was one more thing to type at the moment somebody is trying to record that the
// app exists — and deferred WHAT IT COSTS US A MONTH to version two, in Aurora's
// own words: "it's a much more complex topic, not a single number".
//
// Both COLUMNS stay, and so do both values on this form's state. An app's monthly
// cost is an input to the agency's own margin (lib/internal-money.ts sums it),
// and a form that stopped asking for a number while still SENDING one would
// quietly zero every app it was used to edit. So `url` and `toolCostCentsPerMonth`
// ride through from `initial` untouched on an edit, and a newly recorded app
// simply starts without them.
//
// FormShell (R4) + a per-session draft (R7), like every other write.

                    exact checklist: first "avatars smaller in this cases, we have
                    3 sizes of avatar, use the smaller one" (which `size="row"`,
                    then the smallest of `record-mark.tsx`'s three sizes,
                    answered), and then, on the same day, still "too big" — `row`
                    was never actually the smallest box the component could draw,
                    only the smallest of three sizes decided without reference to
                    the kit's own person-mark scale. `choice` (24px,
                    `record-mark.tsx`'s `BOX`) is a fourth, NAMED size, decided
                    once in the shared component rather than hand-rolled here a
                    second time. */}
