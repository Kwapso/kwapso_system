"use client"

// WHAT ONE APP HAS GIVEN BACK — hours, and what those hours are worth
// (CHECKLIST 8.13, Aurora's ap3 over the owner's "client rate times hours").
//
// THE MODEL MOVED ON 25 Aug 2026, and this header is the record. Aurora's ap3
// priced a process by ONE role named on the process, against the internal rate
// card — and then the step work landed: every STEP names a client role whose
// rate is frozen onto it, and the ONE savings seam prices the subtraction
// step by step. For six days both arithmetics ran, and on the owner's screen
// they disagreed — €2,766.35 on the map, 0.00 here, "no role attached" about a
// map with four priced steps. Two ways of computing one number is the defect;
// the seam's way survives because it is the figure the client is shown.
//
// So the panel now reads the seam's money straight off the payload and names
// the one link that can still be missing:
//
//   no priced step   → open the map and say who does its steps
//   some steps bare  → the coverage is said on the row ("4 of 9 steps priced")
//
// STILL A STAFF DOOR. The door refuses a portal caller and nothing under
// web-portal/ names it; the client's own value screen shows hours from its own
// fenced door. Pricing lives where the roles live — the client's record.
//
// R25 rides the payload: `caption` comes back with the figure and is rendered
// word for word. A savings number without the sentence that says what it is made
// of is a number nobody should be asked to believe.
