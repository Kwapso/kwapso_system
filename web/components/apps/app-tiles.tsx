"use client"

// APP TILES — one system, as a thing you recognise rather than a line you read.
//
// UI-RULEBOOK K9 allows a card grid exactly where a record carries an image, and
// G3 says the type mark sits in a rounded square where a logo would. An app has
// both, and since 0037_app_logo it has the second one for real: the client's own
// mark where they have one, the stage mark where they do not. So the square is
// the tile's subject and the words underneath are two lines at most — the name,
// and the client (K1).
//
// FLAT FILL, NO BORDER, NO HOVER LIFT (C2): the separation between a tile and
// the page is three per cent of lightness, which is the brand's whole surface
// system. The one motion is the 200ms house curve on the background, which is
// the interaction feedback UI-RULEBOOK C11 permits on an interactive control.
//
// It is a real <a> so the browser's own affordances work (open in a new tab,
// copy the address), with softNavigate on click so the History API move stays
// a soft one. Extracted from the apps screen because the account record shows
// the same tiles for one client's systems.

/** THE SQUARE AN APP IS KNOWN BY — its logo, or the stage mark it has always
 * drawn. It reads the two things an APP has that no other record does (its stage
 * mark, and its logo column) and hands them to the ONE mark every record on both
 * front doors is drawn with (`shared/web/record-mark.tsx`).
 *
 * It was that component first, alone, and everything the header there says about
 * a stored path outliving its bytes was learned here (web/test/app-mark.test.tsx,
 * which still holds this signature to it). What changed on 19 Aug 2026 is that
 * every OTHER record got the same treatment instead of one of thirteen others, so
 * the state, the `safeSrc` call and the `onError` fallback moved to where they
 * are shared and this became the two lines that are actually about an app. */
