"use client"

// APPS — the systems we have built. An app belongs to ONE account, always (the
// owner's ruling), and everything else in the work engine hangs off it: a sprint
// covers one app, and a story is on one app whether or not it is in a sprint.
//
// IT IS A WALL OF TILES, NOT A LIST OF ROWS (CHECKLIST 8.1, 17 Aug 2026). An app
// is the one record in this app that a person recognises by SIGHT — it has a
// mark, a client and a stage, and the previous screen spent all three on a
// dot-separated subtitle nobody read. UI-RULEBOOK K9 permits a card grid exactly
// where the record carries an image, and G3 says the mark sits in a rounded
// square where a logo would; both are true here.
//
// TWO TABS, EACH GROUPED BY STAGE (8.2). Active is everything still being worked
// on; Inactive is Completed and Archived, which is the only pair of stages that
// means "done with". Under each tab the tiles group under a plain stage heading
// (UI-RULEBOOK K6), in the order the agency reads them. The count on each tab is
// the exact number of rows behind it, arbitrated through CountedTabs (R16) so
// the heading above stands down rather than saying the number twice.
//
// AN ARCHIVED APP (deactivated_at set) is a different fact from the Archived
// STAGE, and both land in Inactive on purpose: from the reader's side "put away"
// is one idea, and a tile that says "archived" under the heading "Archived" is
// the app agreeing with itself.
//
// A SECOND VIEW, LIST, ADDED 2026-09-01 — Tiles STAYS THE DEFAULT (CHECKLIST
// 8.1, above, is a ruling about which body an app opens on, not a ban on a
// second one). An agency two years in has tens of apps under one stage
// heading, and "which of my clients' systems are in Development" is a
// question a sorted list answers better than a wall of squares. `apps` is
// BOUNDED (R14) — every row narrowed/sorted for Tiles (`shown`, below) is
// already in hand, so List is a pure re-rendering of the same array through
// `appsListRecipe` ("apps.list", web/lib/screens.ts) via `ScreenRenderer`,
// never a second fetch or a second narrowing pass. `ViewSwitch`
// (shared/ui/components/collection-frame/view-switch.tsx) puts `views[0]`
// first as its own first-run default and its own doc recommends the TABLE
// go there — but the kit's doc also says plainly it cannot check which entry
// IS the table, "that route's vocabulary". Apps' vocabulary is CHECKLIST
// 8.1: Tiles is the deliberate default, not a stand-in for a missing table,
// so `views` stays `[Tiles, List]` in that order — don't "fix" it to match
// the kit's generic recommendation.
