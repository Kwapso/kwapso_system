// THE RUNNING TIMER, in the header of every screen (.plans/BUILD-1 §5: "a running
// timer appears in the header of EVERY screen, and clicking it returns to what it
// is timing").
//
// It counts up in the BROWSER, from the moment the server said it started. The
// alternative — asking the server every second — is a request per second per open
// tab, per person, for the whole working day, to display a number arithmetic can
// produce for free. The server's `startedAt` is the truth; the clock is a
// rendering of it.
//
// It shows NOTHING when nothing is running, which is most of the time and is the
// whole reason it can live in the header at all. And it never renders for a
// client login: the door it reads refuses one (R21), and a portal caller has no
// timers by construction — the shell that mounts it is the agency app's.

 * and pay nothing for the empty case. It stopped being true when the agency
 * shell's header BAND became the kit's own element (`ScreenShell`, kit
 * v1.2.28): the band carries the shell's header padding whether or not
 * anything is inside it, so "render null" now costs ~90px of empty band above
 * every screen. `AppShell` asks this first and omits the band entirely.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A SECOND REQUEST. `useCached` goes through `loadShared`, which is
 * keyed and de-duplicates in flight, so this hook and the `TimerBar` beneath
 * it share one fetch, one cache entry and one live-sync listener (R15 —
 * `runningTimersKey` is in the registry already). `null` for the team is the
