"use client"

// A small render-error catcher. When the wrapped UI throws, instead of Next.js
// nuking the whole page with the generic "a client-side exception has occurred",
// this shows an honest, generic card (and logs the stack) so nobody sees a blank
// tab. The raw error message is diagnostic value, not user copy — it renders
// too, but only on a host where "diagnosable" means us: staging or a local dev
// server. A client on production sees the same plain sentence a member of staff
// sees; the owner's ruling, 2026-08-29, after the raw error.message shipped to
// everyone regardless of environment. React error boundaries must be classes.
