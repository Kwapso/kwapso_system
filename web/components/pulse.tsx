"use client"

// THE PULSE — the team's week as big numbers and pictures, and the two pictures
// on their own for the pages they belong to.
//
// THE OWNER'S PLACEMENT RULE, applied literally: aggregate a metric into a big
// number when there is enough data to aggregate, and reach for a chart when a lot
// of data arrives BY GROUP (the stages a request can sit in) or BY TIME (the
// hours a week). Everything here is one of those two shapes and nothing else is.
//
// AND THE SIZE RULE WITH IT: "not taking up the whole screen … part of the screen
// while the other data is shown". So a band is one grid row of numbers and one row
// of short charts at BAND_HEIGHT, and whatever the screen was already for starts
// underneath. Nothing here scrolls and nothing here is the hero.
//
// ── FOUR THINGS THAT ARE DELIBERATE ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 1. A SECTION THE CALLER MAY NOT READ IS ABSENT, NOT EMPTY. The door answers
//    `null` for a module their role cannot read (R18), and `null` renders NOTHING
//    — no card, no empty state, no "0". A zero would tell somebody there are no
//    tickets when the truth is that they may not look at them, and an empty state
//    would invite them to make one.
//
// 2. A CHART IS NEVER DRAWN ON ZEROS. A brand-new team has no work logs, and eight
//    flat weeks along the bottom of an axis is a picture of nothing wearing the
//    clothes of information. Every visual asks whether it has anything to say
//    first, and says an honest sentence instead when it does not.
//
// 3. THE NUMBERS ARE THE SAME NUMBERS AS EVERYWHERE ELSE. They come off the one
//    aggregate door, which is built from the very count functions the tab badges
//    are built from — so "12" here and "12" on the Tickets tab are one expression
//    rather than two that agree today. COUNTS render through the one `formatCount`
//    seam (R16); HOURS do not, because hours are not a collection count and
//    abbreviating them to "1.3k" would be nonsense.
//
// 4. THE TWO CHARTS ARE EXPORTED SEPARATELY, and every screen that draws one
//    reads the SAME cache key. The Tickets page and Home show the same stage
//    picture; the Work logs page and Home show the same eight weeks. One read,
//    one answer, so two screens can never be looking at two different Mondays.

 * it draws one. The file's own header explains why lazy-loading the COMPONENT
 * alone was not enough (the config lives in the same library module, so importing
 * it pulled the module anyway).
