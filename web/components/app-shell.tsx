// kit's. That half-adoption is exactly what read as "completely different"
// from the kit's own reviewed Rail on the client's side-by-side. Adopted for
// real below: `railGroups`/`railMember` map this app's nav registry and signed-
// in user onto Rail's own `groups`/`member` shape, and the registry entry that
// parked this (`COMPOSITION_EXEMPT["templates/rail.tsx"]`) is deleted with this
// change — a composition genuinely reached is stale as an exemption (R45).
//
// THREE OF RAIL'S OWN SLOTS ARE DELIBERATELY UNUSED HERE (client feedback, 31
// Aug 2026) — `mark`/`wordmark`, `member` and `collapsible` are all passed
// `null`/`false` below, and this file draws its own equivalents instead. Each
// is a documented kit gap, not an oversight:
//   · Rail's `groups` prop has no "no heading" shape for a destination that
//     wants to sit outside every section (House) — every RailGroup draws a
//     clickable disclosure control over its items, even at an empty label.
//     `StandaloneNavItem` below draws that one, token-for-token with Rail's
//     own row treatment.
//   · Rail's own collapse button is icon PLUS always-visible label, drawn
//     between the nav and the member chip. The client wants it icon-only, on
//     a `Tooltip`, floating on the rail column's own edge at the member
//     card's height (`railEdgeToggle`, below `railContent` in `AppShell`) —
//     a position Rail has no prop to reach at all (`collapsible` draws its
//     control inside its own box, never straddling the column's border).
//   · `RailMember` has no actions slot, so the account menu's trigger cannot
//     sit INSIDE Rail's own chip. The member card below rebuilds the chip's
//     look with the kit's own `Avatar`/`Text` and hosts `ProfileMenu` inside it.

 * the toggle has since moved again, to a floating edge-handle at the rail's
 * foot (see the note beside `railEdgeToggle` in `AppShell`), so this

 * default; this file passes `mark={null}` to Rail and draws it here instead

 * below it. R39 — the kit supplies the artwork (`Logotype`/`Isotype`), this
 * file only places it and sets its size.
 *
 * THE STEP WENT UP, REVERSING THE EARLIER RULING. It was `--icon-20` on a
 * 24 Aug 2026 instruction with a reference screenshot ("the logo on top of
 * sidebar smaller, check screenshot for reference"); the client, live on
 * staging a week later, asked the opposite: "make the logo bigger". One rung
 * up the ladder, `--icon-24` (tokens.css's icon delivery sizes), the next
 * step after the 22/24 pair and the ladder's own next-common size after 20 —
 * a correction, not a guess at a new number. The air below it moved with the
 * mark: see the `pb-6` on this component's wrapper in `AppShell`, doubled
 * from the `pb-3` it shared with every other block in the rail's rhythm,
 * because the client asked for it by name ("leave air underneath it"),

     scheme` / `[data-theme]` — which is correct only for the spine whose own
     ground follows the theme. The other two paint a ground that does NOT:
     ink is dark in both palettes and mango is #FED069 in both. So a light
     theme on the ink spine drew the DARK cut on ink's dark ground, and a dark
     theme on mango drew the LIGHT cut on mango's bright one. Reported by the
     client, 2026-09-03, on the ink half: the wordmark reads white and correct
     in dark and is unreadable in light.

     Same fault, same day, one layer up from the idle nav label — see the long

  // `Rail`.
  //
  // THE TEAM SWITCHER IS HIDDEN HERE, NOT REMOVED (client feedback, 31 Aug
  // 2026: "remove the top kwapso, keep only the logo"). It drew a circular
  // avatar plus the team's own name — title case, "Kwapso" — directly ABOVE
  // Rail's own lowercase wordmark, because kwapso runs one team and that team
  // is named Kwapso: a real, working control (`team-switcher.tsx`) that
  // happened to repeat the brand identity Rail already draws, on this one
  // deployment. `TEAM_SCREENS_HIDDEN` (shared/product.ts) is the same flag the
  // switcher itself already reads to become a plain nameplate — a second team
  // ever existing is exactly the condition under which its name would stop
  // matching the wordmark, so a fork that flips it back on gets its switcher
  // back here too, unlike the mobile top bar which keeps it unconditionally
  // (nothing else names the team there). Rail draws NO mark of its own
  // (`mark`/`wordmark` both `null` below) — `NavBrandHeader` draws the same
  // artwork instead, at the top of the column on its own (see the note on
  // that component for why Rail's own default isn't used here, and the note
  // on `railEdgeToggle` for where the collapse control lives now).
  //
  // THE ACCOUNT MENU (profile / settings / appearance / sign out) has no home
  // in Rail either: the member chip is ONE action and this app's menu is four,
  // including the three-segment theme control that already can't live in a
  // collapsible rail (see profile-menu.tsx's own note on why it moved out of
  // this file in the first place). `ProfileMenu`, `compact`, now sits INSIDE
  // the member card below rather than beside it (client feedback, 31 Aug 2026:
  // "the three dots... should be in user card, inside aligned to left") — Rail
  // draws no member chip of its own (`member={null}`) because `RailMember` has
  // no actions slot to host the trigger in, so this file rebuilds the chip's
  // look (the same `--spine-*` tokens, the same `Avatar`) around it instead.
  //
  // IT FILLS THE COLUMN, AND THE COLUMN IS ALREADY ONE WINDOW TALL (kit
  // v1.2.28, 2026-09-02). This node used to be `sticky top-0 h-[100svh]` with
  // the column's own `--rail-inset` cancelled by a negative margin and
  // re-spent here — a whole mechanism whose only job was to make a rail
  // inside a DOCUMENT-SCROLLED page look viewport-tall while the column it
  // sat in grew with whatever the page's body needed. THE PAGE DOES NOT
  // SCROLL ANY MORE: `ScreenShell`'s page level is `h-dvh overflow-hidden`
  // and the rail column is a flex item of a full-height row, so the column IS
  // the window's height, exactly, on every route and at every scroll
  // position. `flex-1 min-h-0` fills it — main-axis growth inside the
  // column's own flex column, not a percentage — and there is nothing left
  // for `sticky` to pin against, because nothing behind the rail moves.
  //
  // The nav region still scrolls INSIDE its own wrapper (`min-h-0 flex-1
  // overflow-y-auto`), not the whole column, so a long list of sections can
  // never push the standalone anchor or the account menu off screen — Rail's
  // own `min-h-full` needs a sized box to fill, and this wrapper is it. House
  // sits OUTSIDE that scrolling wrapper (the same "the anchor keeps its end
  // of the rail" property the old House-first/Gear-last order had), so it
  // never scrolls out of view.
  //
  // THE COLLAPSE CONTROL IS THE SHELL'S NOW, AND IT IS NOT DRAWN HERE. This
  // file used to render `railEdgeToggle` beside this node — a floating,
  // half-in-half-out circular button straddling the rail column's own border
  // at the member card's height, sticky to its own `100svh` window for the
  // same reason this node was. The kit draws the edge handle itself since
  // v1.2.28 (a 3px bar in a 20x44 target, at the column's outer rim when the
  // rail is open and its inner edge when it is shut), so drawing ours too
  // would be two controls for one decision. What this file still owes the
  // shell is the STATE: `railCollapsed` + `onRailCollapsedChange` below, and
  // `collapsed` threaded into our own Rail — the shell cannot reach inside a
  // rail node it was handed. (Rail's name is written in prose here and not as
  // its JSX tag, for the reason `StandaloneNavItem`'s own header already
  // gives: web/test/shell-nav.test.ts finds the rail by the FIRST index of
  // that tag in this file, so a mention above the real element moves the
  // anchor and fails a test about something else entirely.)
  // TWO DESCENDANT-SELECTOR OVERRIDES LIVE ON THIS ROOT NODE, THE SAME
  // REASON AS THE RADIUS OVERRIDE BELOW (`shared/ui/` is vendored and
  // pinned; a hand-edit there fails web/test/vendored-kit.test.ts): reached
  // from OUTSIDE the kit, on an ancestor this file owns.
  //
  // THERE IS NO LONGER A CHIP-TEXT OVERRIDE HERE, AND THE 31 AUG RULING IS
  // STILL HONOURED — BY THE KIT, NOT BY THIS FILE. This slot used to hold a
  // descendant-selector entry aimed at a rail row that is neither active nor
  // hovered, colouring it with the theme's own secondary-ink token. (Described
  // rather than spelled, and that is not fussiness: `@import "tailwindcss"`
  // scans THIS FILE, so a comment quoting the utility compiles it back into
  // the shipped stylesheet — web/app/globals.css carries the same warning over
  // the same class of bug, and this comment's own first draft reproduced it.)
  //
  // It was added for the client's 31 Aug 2026 ruling ("i want more visual differentiation
  // between what's a section and what's a chip. maybe chips texts darker?
  // keep section text as they are"). At the time a nav ROW and a SECTION
  // HEADING both rested at `--spine-ink-quiet`, so they read as one tone in
  // two sizes, and `--ink-secondary` was the already-named tier between quiet
  // and full ink. THE PREMISE EXPIRED TWO DAYS LATER. Kit v1.2.18
  // (2026-09-02) moved `rail.tsx`'s `ROW_IDLE` off `--spine-ink-quiet` and
  // onto `--spine-ink` outright, on a LATER client ruling given live against
  // all six spine x theme combinations, verbatim: "nav text should ALWAYS be
  // either pure black or pure white — never gray — depending on what it sits
  // on." The heading was deliberately left on `--spine-ink-quiet` (a heading
  // is not nav text), so the kit's own default now draws the 31 Aug
  // separation MORE strongly than this override ever did — measured, not
  // assumed, as ink on each spine's own `--spine-fill` ground:
  //
  //                 this override   kit ROW_IDLE   the heading it must beat
  //   paper/light        8.08          15.76              5.90
  //   ink/light          1.95  ✘       17.39             11.53
  //   mango/light        6.19          12.07             12.07
  //   paper/dark         9.03          13.62              7.03
  //   ink/dark          11.31          17.06              8.81
  //   mango/dark         1.05  ✘       12.07             12.07
  //
  // AND IT WAS BREAKING TWO OF THE SIX. `--ink-secondary` is THEME-scoped
  // (#4a4946 light / #d5d1c9 dark) and knows nothing about spine, while two
  // of the three spines have a ground that does NOT follow the theme: ink's
  // is dark in both palettes, mango's is #FED069 in both. So light-theme
  // ink put a dark grey on a dark ground at 1.95:1, and dark-theme mango put
  // a light grey on a bright ground at 1.05:1 — both far under AA for
  // primary navigation text, and neither reachable in the 2026-09-02 →
  // 2026-09-03 window when `ink` was retired and mango was not yet paired
  // with a dark palette in review. The kit's per-spine `--spine-ink` is
  // correct on all six by construction (12.07 – 17.39) because it is
  // SPINE-scoped, which is the axis this ground actually moves on.
  //
  // ON MANGO THE OVERRIDE WAS ALSO BACKWARDS: tokens.css states that spine
  // has NO quiet tier on purpose (`--spine-ink-quiet` IS `--ink-on-accent`),
  // so its rows and headings are one charcoal by design and the chip/section
  // distinction there is carried by weight and size. Forcing `--ink-secondary`
  // made a mango chip LIGHTER than the section above it — the opposite of what
  // the client asked for on 31 Aug.
  //
  // Deleted rather than made spine-aware: a spine-aware rewrite would land on
  // `--spine-ink` for every spine, which is exactly what `ROW_IDLE` already
  // says. The not-hovered clause went with it — it was pairing with a kit hover
  // rule that lifted the row to `--spine-ink`, and v1.2.18 removed that rule, so
  // all the clause did was make a resting row jump colour under the pointer.
  //
  // (1) THE SECTION CHEVRON, RE-ALIGNED (client, 31 Aug 2026: "on sections,
  // move the arrow that collapse/expands to the right, so it aligns with the
  // icons"). Checked against the row geometry rather than guessed: a row's
  // icon slot and a heading's label both start at the same x (`--rail-inset
  // + --space-3`, one from the full-bleed row paying its negative margin
  // back in padding, the other from the column's own padding plus the
  // heading's `px-[var(--space-3)]`) — rail.tsx's own 24 Aug 2026 note has
  // the heading's chevron sitting AFTER the label instead, at a width that
  // moves with the label's own length. "Aligns with the icons" reads as the
  // icons' fixed column, not the far edge of the rail — the far edge lines
  // up with nothing below it. Reordering the heading's two children with
  // `order` (its label span and its `aria-hidden` chevron are already
  // siblings in a flex row) puts the glyph at that same fixed x with no
  // accessibility cost: both chevrons are `aria-hidden`, so a screen
  // reader's order is unaffected and only the sighted layout moves.
  // (2) A HAIRLINE BETWEEN NAMED SECTIONS (client, 31 Aug 2026: wants the
  // same thin rule the profile menu already draws between its own blocks —
  // that menu's `DropdownMenuSeparator` is a filled `h-px bg-border` block,

  // (`separator.tsx`'s `default` variant), and the SAME weight the file
  // header comment above already claims for "the rail's named sections, here
  // and in the phone's sheet" — true only of the phone's sheet (its
  // `railBlocks.map` below literally renders `<Separator className="my-2"
  // />`), never of the desktop rail: `Rail` (vendored, R45) renders every
  // `[data-slot=rail-group]` itself, inside one `<nav>`, with a plain flex
  // `gap` and no rule between them, so a real `<Separator>` node cannot be
  // interleaved without a hand-edit to `rail.tsx` (`web/test/vendored-kit.test.ts`
  // would fail it). Painted from OUTSIDE instead, the same descendant-selector
  // technique as the two overrides below: a `box-shadow` inset at each
  // non-first group's own top edge, `--hairline-over` (tokens.css) being
  // exactly `inset 0 1px 0 var(--hair)` — `--hair` IS `--border` (tokens.css
  // §"hair"), so this is the identical colour and 1px weight
  // `DropdownMenuSeparator`/`Separator` paint with a real element, with no
  // extra DOM node the vendored `<nav>` never asked for. The shadow anchors to
  // the border box, not the padding box, so it sits exactly on the seam
  // between one group's box and the next — which is also why the padding
  // BELOW it has to be measured against something, not guessed. `<nav
  // data-slot="rail-nav">` (rail.tsx) lays every group out with its own
  // `gap-[var(--space-5)]`, so the space ABOVE the hairline (last item of the
  // group above, down to this group's own top edge, where the line is drawn)
  // is always exactly `--space-5` (20px) — a value this file doesn't set and
  // can't change without hand-editing the vendored nav. RE-DERIVED 1 Sep 2026
  // after the client flagged the gap as uneven: the padding below used to
  // read `pt-[var(--space-3)]` (12px), reasoned against `DropdownMenuSeparator`'s
  // own `my-[var(--space-2h)]` — a comparison to the WRONG neighbour, since
  // that menu's rule sits between two rows in one flex column with one gap value
  // on both sides of it, and this hairline sits between two DIFFERENT
  // measurements (the kit's own `gap-5` above, this override's own padding
  // below) that were never the same number. `pt-[var(--space-5)]` matches the
  // kit's own gap instead of a value borrowed from an unrelated component, so
  // the heading below the line now sits exactly as far from it as the last
  // item above the line does: 20px on both sides, measured and matched, not
  // assumed even.

          be the ONLY thing making Rail's own active row a pill, back when the
          vendored kit's `ROW_EXPANDED` (templates/rail.tsx) was still
          `rounded-none` and could not be hand-edited here (pinned; a hand-
          edit fails web/test/vendored-kit.test.ts) — so this reached the
          kit's own stable hook, `data-slot="rail-item"` plus the
          `data-active` Rail sets on the lit row, from OUTSIDE the vendored
          file. The kit shipped `rounded-pill` natively in `ROW_EXPANDED` as
          of v1.2.16 (2026-09-02), so `<Rail>`'s own rows no longer need this
          — it now just re-asserts a value the kit already draws. Left in
          rather than deleted: a future design-sync that regresses the kit's
          own value fails silent instead of square, and there is nothing to
          re-derive if it does.

          THE ACTUAL BUG THAT KEPT RECURRING WAS NEVER HERE — it was that
          this div wraps ONLY `<Rail>` (below), and `StandaloneNavItem`'s
          entries (House, `homeStandalone.map` above) render BEFORE this div,
          entirely outside it. Every prior pass fixed `<Rail>`'s own rows —
          first this override, then the kit itself — and House's separate,
          hand-copied skin (this file's own `StandaloneNavItem`, which has
          to duplicate the kit's row shape at all only because rail.tsx never
          exports `ROW_EXPANDED`/`ROW_COLLAPSED` — see that function's own
          header) kept its stale `rounded-none` untouched through both,
          because nobody traced that House takes neither code path. Fixed
          2026-09-02 by matching `StandaloneNavItem`'s own literal to the
          kit's current value. The durable fix — exporting the kit's row
          constants so there is only one shape to drift — is still owed;
          this stops the immediate bleeding. */}
      {/* `overflow-x-clip` HAS TO SIT HERE TOO, NOT JUST ON `railContent`
          ABOVE — measured live, 1 Sep 2026, after the client reported the
          rail scrolling sideways. This div sets `overflow-y-auto` and
          nothing for `overflow-x`, which reads as "leave it alone" but isn't:
          CSS overflow is a pair, and the spec computes an axis left at its
          initial `visible` as `auto` instead the moment its OTHER axis is
          anything but `visible` (so a lone `overflow-y-auto` quietly becomes
          `overflow-y-auto overflow-x-auto`, not `overflow-y-auto
          overflow-x-visible`).

          THIS DIV USED TO RE-SPEND `--rail-inset` (`-mx-[…] px-[…]`), AND NO
          LONGER NEEDS TO. That pair was added 2 Sep 2026 for a client report
          of a SQUARE active row under a grouped section ("Apps" under
          "Build"): back then every `<Rail>` row bled full-width through its
          own `-mx-[var(--rail-inset)]`, and `overflow-x-clip` clips anything
          past THIS box's padding edge — which sat 24px short of where the
          bled row's `rounded-pill` curve actually lived, so the curve was cut
          away whole and the corner read flat. Cancelling and re-spending the
          inset here moved the clip boundary out to meet it.

          The kit then removed the bleed outright in v1.2.22 (the client's
          next ruling on the same row: "allow a bit of blank space on the
          sides"), so `ROW_EXPANDED` is a plain inset pill now and nothing in
          `<Rail>` reaches past this box at all. The pair had become a
          geometric no-op sitting on top of a reason that no longer existed,
          which is the shape a future reader mis-copies. `overflow-x-clip`

           EVERY OTHER CLASS THIS LINE USED TO CARRY IS GONE, AND THE KIT
           RESOLVED THEM RATHER THAN THIS FILE DROPPING THEM. It read

           [&_[data-slot=screen-shell-card]]:flex-1
           [&_[data-slot=screen-shell-card]]:min-h-0` — a hand-built height
           chain, measured into place on 2026-08-31, whose whole job was to
           give the SCREEN level a real height when the PAGE level was a
           `min-h-full` block inside a `min-h-[100svh]` flex column and no
           percentage in the chain resolved. The reshape makes all of that
           unnecessary at the source: PAGE is a `h-dvh` box with a REAL
           height, SCREEN reads `h-full` off it, and every level below is
           `flex-1 min-h-0` inside the kit's own file. Keeping the override
           would be a second opinion about a height the kit now states.

           ONE OVERRIDE ARRIVES AS THE OTHERS LEAVE, AND IT IS A SCROLL FIX
           RATHER THAN A SPACING OPINION — MEASURED IN A BROWSER, NOT REASONED.
           `position: sticky` resolves its offsets against the SCROLLPORT'S
           PADDING BOX, and the kit's body pane is `p-[var(--space-6)]
           lg:p-[var(--space-7)]`. So every sticky bar this app draws inside
           the pane — the record tab strip (`STICKY_TABS`, record-chrome.tsx)
           and the collection tab strip
           (`shared/web/screen-engine/tabs-view.tsx`) — pins 32px BELOW
           the pane's own top edge, while the pane CLIPS at that edge. The band
           between the two is inside the scroller, so content scrolls THROUGH
           it: measured at 1440x900, a probe row sat at y=50.5-90.5 with the
           pinned bar's top at y=86.5 — visibly above the thing that is
           supposed to be covering it. Under the old shape the document was the
           scroller, `top-0` meant the viewport's own top edge, and there was
           no band for anything to appear in.

           THE PADDING MOVES DOWN ONE LEVEL RATHER THAN AWAY. `pt-0` on the
           pane, the same value re-spent on the content div below: the inset a
           screen sees is unchanged to the pixel (border-box, so `min-h-full`
           still floors that div to the pane and the footer still lands on the
           pane's floor), and a sticky child now pins at the pane's true top
           edge with nothing able to show above it. Only the BLOCK-START edge
           moves — the pane keeps its own inline padding, so the bleed on
           `STICKY_TABS` still reaches exactly the edge it was measured
           against. (That bleed belonged to `CondensedTitleBar` until it was
           deleted on 2026-09-03; the strip inherited both the bleed and the
           measurement, which is why this paragraph still holds.)

           IT IS AN OVERRIDE HERE AND NOT A KIT EDIT for the reason the five
           rail overrides above give: `shared/ui/` is vendored and pinned and a
           hand-edit fails web/test/vendored-kit.test.ts. Owed upstream — "a
           scroller's own padding must not sit between a sticky child and the
           clip" is the kit's sentence to write, not this file's. */

           and the shell cannot reach inside a node it was handed — so the
           value goes down (`railCollapsed`, and `collapsed` on our own
           Rail further up) and every change comes back
           (`onRailCollapsedChange`) to the same localStorage key the rail's
           own toggle used to write. Without the pair the handle would draw in
           the open position for ever while the column beside it narrowed.

           THE TWO LABELS ARE THE APP'S EXISTING WORDS, NOT THE KIT'S. The kit
           defaults to "Collapse the navbar" / "Open the navbar" — good
           English, and English is the only language a kit default is ever
           said in (R28's walk stops at `shared/ui/`, so a default cannot be
           in the catalogue). "Collapse" / "Expand" are already catalogued and
           already translated, and they were this control's own labels before
           the handle moved into the kit. */

           third level. Passed as an EMPTY BOX, not as the panel: the panel is
           mounted once at the ROOT (agent-host.tsx) so it outlives the
           navigation it causes itself, and it portals its elements into this
           box (web/lib/agent-dock.tsx has the whole argument, and
           web/test/agent-host.test.ts still locks the panel out of this file).

           SHUT MEANS ABSENT, AND THAT IS THE CLIENT'S OWN SENTENCE ("closed
           asstant show nothing. it's literally only the bar"). The kit does
           it: with `asideOpen` false it renders no column at all — not a
           zero-width box, not an icon strip — and the card takes the width
           back. Only the 3px handle stays, in the ground's own gutter. So
           nothing here needs a second opinion about the closed state; passing
           the slot unconditionally is what makes the HANDLE exist, and the
           handle is the only assistant control on a wide screen (the mango
           launcher is not drawn there — `SHELL.md`'s one-mango rule, argued in
           agent-host.tsx).

           GATED THE SAME WAY THE LAUNCHER ALWAYS WAS. No `agent:create`, no
           column and no handle: a bar that opens an empty panel is worse than
           no bar. The server re-checks every action regardless.

           BELOW `md` THE KIT DROPS THIS COLUMN ITSELF, and the assistant
           becomes the floating panel again — one decision, taken by width in
           agent-host.tsx against the kit's own 48rem, never a second copy of
           the panel.

           THE OPEN STATE IS CONTROLLED AND PERSISTED, exactly as the rail's
           collapse is one prop above: the value goes down (`asideOpen`) and
           every change comes back (`onAsideOpenChange`) to the module store
           that mirrors it to `localStorage`, so the column the person left
           open is the column they come back to.

           THE LABELS ARE THE KIT'S NOUNS, in this app's catalogue. Unlike the
           rail's "Collapse"/"Expand" — which were this app's words before the
           handle moved into the kit — the assistant had no shorter name of its
           own: "Open the assistant" was already the launcher's own label and
           "Close the assistant" is new (R28: extracted, catalogued, and the
           ceiling moved in the same commit). */

             one create control belongs in the card, which is where every
             screen in this app already draws it.

             `onClickCapture` ON THE STRIP ITSELF, not on a wrapper div.
             `BreadcrumbFolders` spreads its rest props onto its own `<nav>`,
             so the interception rides the component and adds no element —
             which matters here more than it did in the header band: the strip
             pays a negative block-end margin to tuck its tabs' feet under the
             card, and the kit's own slot deliberately declares no z-index, no
             isolate and no transform so the tabs' z-1/z-3 can resolve either
             side of the card's z-2. A wrapper is one more box that could open
             a stacking context by accident.

             R37: the kit renders REAL `<a href>` crumbs — middle-click and
             copy-address still work — and the plain left click is intercepted

            visible other axis computes `overflow-y` to `auto`, which makes this
            a SCROLL CONTAINER — and a `position: sticky` child then pins to a
            box that never scrolls, so it silently does nothing, which is
            exactly what happened to the record header and tab strip (D3) the
            first time they were built. `clip` clips the same overflow and
            creates no scroll container.
         *
         * THE BOX IT MUST NOT BECOME IS NO LONGER THE DOCUMENT, AND THE RULE
         * IS UNCHANGED BY THAT. Since kit v1.2.28 the one scroller behind
         * every screen is `ScreenShell`'s body pane
         * (`[data-slot="screen-shell-body"]`), the direct parent of this div;
         * the page itself is `h-dvh overflow-hidden` and does not move. So the
         * sticky layers this div wraps — the record tab strip (`STICKY_TABS`,
         * record-chrome.tsx) and the collection tab strip
         * (`shared/web/screen-engine/tabs-view.tsx`) — now pin to the pane
         * instead of to the window, which is what they always read as. Turning
         * THIS div into a scroll container would put a second scroller between
         * them and the pane and break both the same way; `clip` is still what
         * stops that.
         *
         * THERE WERE THREE OF THEM UNTIL 2026-09-03. The condensed title bar
         * was the first, and it is gone — client: "when i scroll down, the
         * whole compressed title is useless, so remove that. When I scroll
         * down, what is at the top should be only the tabs." Its measured
         * offset mechanism went with it: both strips pin at `top-0` now
         * because there is nothing above them to clear.
         *
         * ONE PAGE CONTAINER, ONE CAP, ON THE SHELL (R29, UI-RULEBOOK L1). This
         * used to live one level down, in `deep-link-screen.tsx`'s own return —
         * which capped every MODULE screen (meetings, accounts, tickets, …) but
         * not the five account screens rendered straight into this same shell
         * (home, kwapso, settings, profile, invitations): they hit the `return`
         * above that never reaches deep-link-screen's wrapper, so they filled
         * this div edge to edge with nothing capping them at all. Invisible on
         * the laptop width the fix was screenshotted at (1283px, narrower than
         * 1600 anyway) and plainly visible on a wide monitor, where the client
         * measured Kwapso running past 2100px while Meetings, three clicks
         * over, stopped at 1600 — "Kwapso is currently the widest ... meetings
         * is noticeably narrower." Both screens already share this one div;
         * the cap belongs HERE so every screen this shell renders inherits it
         * the same way, and deep-link-screen's own wrapper keeps only the
         * `flex flex-col gap-6` layout it still needs, not a second width.
         *
         * WIDENED AGAIN, TWICE MORE, SAME DAY (client, live on staging, 31 Aug
         * 2026). Round two: "screen width. you made them thinner! i wanted
         * them even wider!" — answered with a guessed fluid cap,
         * `min(96vw,2200px)`. Round three, the one that actually fixed it:
         * "wider screens, align to the right same level as breadcrumbs!" — a
         * real target, not a bigger guess. `ScreenShell`'s header band is
         * `min-w-0` plus its own density padding and sets no width, so it
         * already runs to the full padded edge of the card, the same padding
         * as this content div's own parent (`DENSITY_HEADER`/`DENSITY_BODY`
         * converge at `lg`). `max-w-none` is what makes this div's right edge
         * land on that same edge — no guessed number, fluid or fixed, does
         * that on every rail state (expanded/collapsed) and every viewport
         * the way matching the band's own lack of a cap does.
         *
         * THE CAP IS STILL THIS FILE'S, AND THE SHELL DID NOT TAKE IT.
         * Re-examined on 2026-09-02, because the reshape gave the kit a
         * floating CARD and that is the kind of thing that quietly becomes a
         * second page container: `screen-shell.tsx`'s card is `flex-1` inside
         * the ground's gutter and names no `max-w-*` anywhere, so it is a
         * fluid column and not a measure. There is still exactly one page
         * width in this door and it is still declared here — the same string
         * `PAGE_WIDTH_OWNER` carries in shared/rules/registry.ts, which R29
         * checks verbatim, and there is no `SCREEN_WIDTH_EXEMPT` pin this
         * change makes stale. `mx-auto`/`w-full` stay on the line for R29's
         * own positional signature (`one-page-width`, web/test/rules.test.ts)
         * even though centring has nothing left to do once there is no cap to
         * centre inside of. What DID change is the reference: the crumbs the
         * client asked this edge to line up with are on the GROUND now,
         * outside the card, so the two no longer share an edge and cannot be
         * made to — the card's own padded edge is what a screen aligns to,
         * which is the same edge this line has been landing on all along.
         *
         * `flex flex-col min-h-full` — THE FOOTER-TO-THE-BOTTOM CHAIN STARTS
         * HERE, 2026-08-31. Client, verbatim: "i want that the footer is
         * always at the bottom, even if there's not enough content on the
         * screen to push it down. however i dont want that its all the time
         * visible if there's content, should come when scrolling down" — the
         * ordinary sticky-footer flex trick, and explicitly NOT
         * `position: sticky`/`fixed` (that draws the second behaviour the
         * client just ruled out). `BODY` above (`ScreenShell`'s body pane,
         * the kit's own `screen-shell.tsx`) is a flex item with a real,
         * resolved height once the shell's `flex-1` chain reaches it — a
         * flex item's used height counts as definite for a descendant's
         * percentage height even though nothing here sets an explicit
         * `height` anywhere, which is what lets `min-h-full` floor this div
         * to BODY's own height instead of its own (short) content height.
         * From here down the rest of the chain is plain `flex-1`/`min-h-0`,
         * no percentages needed: `deep-link-screen.tsx`'s content div and its
         * `motion-page-in` wrapper, then `record-chrome.tsx`'s own
         * `RecordScreen` (the one caller this reaches that draws a footer at
         * all — every other screen this div wraps just ends up with a
         * flex column one item taller than its content, which is invisible).
         * THE PANE IS THE ONE SCROLLER THROUGHOUT, and since 2026-09-02 that
         * is a real height rather than an inferred one: `BODY` is `flex-1
         * min-h-0 overflow-y-auto` inside a card inside a `h-dvh` page, so
         * `min-h-full` here floors this div to a number the browser knows
         * outright — the whole hand-built height chain this file used to
         * carry on `ScreenShell`'s own `className` is deleted with it.
         * Nothing here creates a nested scroll box, so a long record's footer
         * still scrolls away ordinarily, past the end of its own content.
         *
         * `pb-24 md:pb-0` IS STILL THE PHONE'S BOTTOM BAR, and it still has

                         an active-row highlight, and it drew it with the RECTANGLE

                         rounded pill"). `rounded-pill` names the shape outright,
                         and `bg-[var(--spine-active-fill)]`/`text-[var(--spine-
                         active-ink)]` are the SAME tokens the desktop rail's own
                         active row paints with (tokens.css: `--spine-active-fill`
                         is mango on the bare `:root`, so it resolves the same way
                         here with no spine wrapper needed) — one active-row look,
                         drawn twice because the row itself cannot be shared (this
                         sheet is a flat button list, not `<Rail>`), matched anyway. */
