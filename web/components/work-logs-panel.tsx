// THE WORK LOGS TAB — one record's time, and the numbers on top of it.
//
// ONE COMPONENT, NOT FOUR. CHECKLIST 6.8 asked for "a work logs tab on the story,
// and on every other detail screen that captures time", and only the story ever
// got one — written inline, in the middle of that screen. Time can be logged
// against four things (WORK_LOG_TARGETS: a story, a ticket, a task and a
// meeting), so finishing that sentence by copying the list three more times would
// be four lists that agree today and drift the first time one of them is fixed.
// It is written once here and hung wherever the clock runs, exactly as
// work-panels.tsx does for the work engine's other nested collections.
//
// THE NUMBERS COME FROM THE SERVER, and that is the half a browser cannot fake.
// The list under them is a PAGE (R14) — a story worked on for a year has more
// rows of time than any page holds — so adding up what is loaded would answer
// "the newest fifty entries" while looking exactly like an answer about the
// record. Every figure here is a SQL aggregate over the whole filter, from a door
// that parses that filter with the very function the list door uses, so the
// header and the rows are one question (R16).
//
// AND NOTHING HERE IS MONEY. A work log is the input to the agency's own margin,
// but what an hour COSTS is derived in the one file R24 fences and never travels
// on this object — so no screen built on this panel can put an internal rate in
// front of anybody. The door refuses a client login outright besides (R21), and
// the client portal has no route to it at all.

 * used to be the only thing that ever primed it, and the panel does not mount
 * until the tab is active — so on a story, a ticket, a task and a meeting the
 * Time badge was missing exactly when a reader needed it to decide whether to

 * registry like any other, fetched when the record OPENS, and this fetch simply

 *
 *   • ENTRIES rendered `String(summary.total)` while the tab strip directly above

 *     read "1.2k" and the tile read "1200" — R16's origin story word for word,
 *     one collection wearing two numbers, and the tile's would have gone on
 *     reading "1000000" long after the door stopped counting.
 *   • PEOPLE ON IT rendered `summary.people.length`, and `people` is the top
 *     `WORK_LOG_GROUP_CAP` by hours. A record worked on by more than fifty people
 *     read "People on it: 50" for ever, with nothing on the screen saying it had
 *     stopped — a capped list's length wearing a total's clothes, which is the
 *     failure the law was written for. `peopleTotal` is the door's own bounded
 *     COUNT over the same filter; the array beside it stays the chart's top fifty.
 *
 * `|| "0"` because a tile is not a badge: `formatCount` renders nothing for a
 * zero, which is right above a tab (no rows, no badge) and wrong inside a card
 * that has already committed a label to the screen. The same expression the pulse
