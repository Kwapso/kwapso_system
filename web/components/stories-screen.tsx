"use client"

// STORIES — the backlog, and the page the team actually lives in. A ticket is
// what a client asks for; a story is what somebody does today.
//
// This was the Work page, which carried the backlog, the sprints, the to-dos,
// our own admin and the time — five collections on one screen because none of
// them had anywhere else to be. Four of the five now have a section of their own
// (the owner's ruling), so what is left here is the backlog and the TIME logged
// against it, which belongs under the work rather than beside it: "where did my
// week go" is a question about these rows.
//
// The screen owns its own dialog rather than routing through the host's ?panel
// machinery, the way the maps screen does: a story needs the sprints, the apps,
// the open tickets and the team's members to be written at all, and that is this
// screen's data.
