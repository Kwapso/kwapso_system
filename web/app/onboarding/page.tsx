"use client"

// Onboarding (locked flow): first name + last name + optional photo + the
// app's background colour, then the tenancy worker either accepts waiting
// invites or creates "{First}'s team" with its own database. Everything here
// is library components.
//
// THE SPINE IS OFFERED HERE — client ruling, 2026-09-02, verbatim: "default
// spine to mango, but everyone can change it during the onboarding or anytime
// at settings". This screen is the "during the onboarding" half; Settings ·
// Appearance is the other. STILL ONE SCREEN: the flow's own comment calls it a
// locked flow, and a second step to hold the cards would trade a one-screen
// sign-up for a wizard in exchange for nothing — the kit's own three-step
// OnboardingRoute is exempted for exactly that mismatch (COMPOSITION_EXEMPT,
// "screens/onboarding.tsx"), and adding the step it describes would be
// adopting the shape we wrote the exemption to refuse.
//
// AND IT IS THE SAME CONTROL SETTINGS DRAWS, not a lighter one invented for
// this screen. `SpineChoice` (shared/web/spine-section.tsx) is the kit's own
// `AppearanceOptionGroup` + `SpinePicture` with the section furniture — the
// heading, the prose and the save-on-press — taken off. Its `short` prop is
// on here: onboarding draws `compositions/screens/onboarding.tsx`'s own
// SHORTER captions, not settings.tsx's longer ones — the kit itself keeps two
// lengths of the same three names, and `SpineChoice` carries both rather than
// picking one (see its own header for why that split is not R34 drift).
//
// A LIGHTER CONTROL WAS CONSIDERED AND IS NOT AVAILABLE, which is the whole
// answer to "picture cards are heavy for a one-screen flow". Kit ruling 26.05
// is explicit and is a client ruling: "a choice that changes how the app looks
// is never a row of pills … one card per option: a small picture of the thing
// itself, the option's name, one line of prose, and a mango badge on the one
// that is set". A Select or a pill row here would break that, and it would put
// a second vocabulary on the same question Settings already answers — which is
// exactly what `SpineChoice` was extracted to prevent. The kit's own
// onboarding composition reaches the same conclusion independently: its step 2
// draws `AppearanceOptionGroup` with these `SpinePicture` cards — three of
// them again, since the client's 2026-09-03 reversal ("i want to go back to
// the 3 options") restored `ink` and `paper` beside `mango`.
//
// SO THE SCREEN IS TALLER, AND THAT IS THE PRICE, PAID KNOWINGLY. The kit's
// group is `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(13.125rem, 1fr))` above a 45rem VIEWPORT,
// and this column is `max-w-sm` (24rem) — even one 13.125rem track barely
// fits, so on a desktop the three cards resolve to one column of full-width
// picture cards (~3.625rem of picture each) rather than the compact rows a
// phone gets below 45rem. The main is `min-h-[100svh]` and not `h-`, so it
// grows and the page scrolls; nothing is clipped. Worth a look on a real
// screen before this ships — it is the one thing here a test cannot see,
// because jsdom lays nothing out.
//
// SKIPPING IT LANDS ON MANGO, and lands there by writing NOTHING. The cards
// open on `toSpine(user.spine)` — mango for anybody who has never chosen — and
// the submit posts only when the person moved them, so `users.spine` stays
// NULL for somebody who simply took the default. NULL means "never chosen" and
// shared/spine.ts keeps that distinct from a deliberate mango on purpose; a
// screen that wrote mango just for being looked at would destroy the
// distinction for every person who ever onboards.
