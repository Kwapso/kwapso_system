      {/* THE PAGE HAS A GROUND. It did not — this element was
       * `min-h-[100svh] antialiased` and nothing else, and I walked the whole
       * chain in the running app on 2026-08-28: <section> → four <div>s →
       * <main> → two <div>s → <body>, every one `rgba(0,0,0,0)`, with <html>
       * transparent too and no rule in the 209KB compiled stylesheet painting
       * either. So the agency app's page ground was the BROWSER CANVAS: pure
       * white under `color-scheme: light` rather than `--background` #FFFEF9,
       * and whatever the host paints in any embedded view.
       *
       * That is not only a wrong tone, it is what hid a second fault. The kit's
       * surface model is two papers on an off-beige ground, and `--surface-panel`
       * is the tone that is VISIBLE on that ground. On white it is visible too —
       * by accident — which is why a `--surface-panel` card standing on a
       * `--surface-panel` card (screen-renderer's CardGrid, 50 of the knowledge
       * base's 51 cards) looked survivable here and would not have on the ground
       * the kit assumes. The two are one change and land together.
       *
       * The client portal has always done this (web-portal/app/layout.tsx). This
       * is the agency door catching up, one class, same token. */}
      {/* THE QUIET CHIP IS THE WRONG BEIGE — client, 2026-08-31, pointing at
       * a Contact's "Contact"/"Can sign in" pills and the assistant panel's
       * quota pill, both screenshotted: "there's a color that you keep
       * getting wrong on the pills. use this color #F7F2EB (the main token
       * for beige)." #F7F2EB is already `--surface-panel` in this palette
       * (tokens.css) — not a new value, the client is naming which of the
       * app's own tokens the pill belongs on. `Badge`'s own default fill
       * (`variant="secondary"`, `shared/ui/components/badge/badge.tsx`) is
       * `bg-surface-quiet` — the kit's documented "quiet chip" tone
       * (`shared/ui/docs/TOKENS.md` §2), a full step darker than
       * `--surface-panel` in light (#E2DDD4 vs #F7F2EB) and a different tone
       * again in dark. Every unqualified `<Badge>` and every explicit
       * `variant="secondary"` in both front doors inherits it — sixty-plus
       * call sites, not one wrong prop, which is why patching call sites
       * would never have stopped the client "keeps getting" this. `Badge` is
       * vendored and pinned (R39; a hand-edit fails `web/test/
       * vendored-kit.test.ts`), so the repoint lives here instead, on the ONE
       * element every screen in this app renders inside: a Badge always
       * carries the kit's own `data-slot="badge"`, and only the quiet
       * variant carries the literal `bg-surface-quiet` utility class (no
       * other variant does), so the selector below repoints exactly that
       * pairing and touches no coloured, destructive, warning, inverse or
       * status-dot badge. `web-portal/app/layout.tsx` carries the identical
       * line for the client portal's own plain badges (e.g. "Main contact").
       * Left as an app-side override rather than a kit edit: the upstream
       * design-mothership doc still calls `--surface-quiet` the deliberate
       * "quiet chip" tone, so this is the client's own live correction to
       * that ruling, not a bug fix, and belongs upstream too (flagged
       * separately) so a future kit pull does not need to relearn it.
       *
       * THE HAIRLINE, ADDED THE SAME DAY AND THEN TAKEN BACK OUT, 2026-08-31.
       * `--surface-panel` (#F7F2EB) sits one faint step off `--background`
       * (#FFFEF9) — 8-14 points a side in RGB — which reads as low contrast
       * the moment a plain pill sits directly on the page ground rather than
       * on a card. The first fix reached for `Card`'s own documented
       * `hairline` case (an inset 1px `--border`) and drew it around every
       * repointed pill. The client rejected that outright on the next
       * review, verbatim: "pills no border!" — an inset hairline is still a
       * STROKE the moment it outlines a pill's whole edge, which is exactly
       * what a pill is never allowed to carry (BUILD-A-SCREEN.md §6.1;
       * separation is a fill or a shading shadow, never an outline). So the
       * hairline is gone from this app-wide rule again: every ordinary pill
       * app-wide (list badges, table badges, the assistant's quota pill,
       * Contact's "Contact"/"Can sign in" pills) reads fine at plain
       * #F7F2EB against its own card or list-row ground with no edge at all
       * — the client only ever re-flagged the ONE place that still read as
       * beige-on-beige after this rule landed, the record header's identity
       * row, because THAT band is transparent and shows the ambient field
       * through rather than sitting on a card (`web/components/
       * record-chrome.tsx`'s `IDENTITY_ROW`, C4). That row now solves its
       * own contrast with a different FILL instead of a border — see its own
       * comment for the token and the reasoning; this rule is untouched for
       * every other Badge in the app. */}
