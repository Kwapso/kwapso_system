// changed row appear (CACHING.md) — and rings it briefly. `traceFor` turns one tool
// call into a URL target (path) plus a highlight selector for a transient ring.
//
// A trace NEVER opens an input dialog (?panel=add|edit). The agent writes DIRECTLY
// through the gated API — it doesn't type into the manual form — so opening that form
// would just leave a blank, stale dialog sitting open after the record already exists
// (the "created the role but left an empty new-role form open" bug). Traces show the
// RESULT, not the input. The target mirrors the /t/<team>/<module>[/<id>] spine of
// deep-link-screen.tsx. READS (list_*/get_*) return null — nothing to show, so the
// panel just narrates them in the step log. Kept as a pure function (no React) so
// it's unit-testable and shared by the panel + its test.
