// THE BADGES, BEFORE THE CLICK — the web half of shared/record-counts.ts.
//
// THE BUG IT CLOSES. Every collection tab on a record detail badged a sidecar
// cache key that only the tab PANEL's own list fetch ever primed, and
// `useCachedValue` is a pure cache READ — it never fetches. So the number
// appeared the moment you opened the tab and not one moment before, and because
// `formatCount` renders nothing for a zero AND nothing for a missing number, an
// unopened tab was indistinguishable from an empty one. The owner's words: "until
// I don't click on the tab, I am always assuming that there is no information in
// that tab because there's no badge count."
//
// THE FIX IS HIS: fetch the COUNTS eagerly, keep the ROWS lazy. This hook asks
// whichever doors a record's children live behind (one per worker, in parallel)
// and primes THE SAME `totalKey(...)` sidecars the badges already read — so the
// badge code barely changes, the tab panels keep priming those same keys when
// they eventually load their rows, and R16 still has exactly one counting path
// to arbitrate.
//
// IT DOES NOT BLOCK FIRST PAINT. It is a separate read from the record's own,
// running beside it: the record is what a person came for, and a screen that
// waited for its badges before drawing its content would have traded one
// annoyance for a worse one. Nothing on the screen awaits this hook — the badges
// simply arrive, exactly as the activity total does.
//
// THREE STATES, KEPT APART IN THE DATA (they render the same, which is the whole
// problem):
//   • a NUMBER in the sidecar — counted. `0` means there are none, and we know;
//   • `null` in the sidecar — the caller's role holds no read right on that
//     module, so nobody counted (R18). In practice the tab is not drawn either,
//     because the screen gates it on the same right;
//   • NOTHING in the sidecar — not counted yet. The only state that resolves.
