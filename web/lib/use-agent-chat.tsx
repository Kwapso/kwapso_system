   THE LIVE CHAT STATE, HOISTED TO MODULE LEVEL.

   THE BUG: AgentHost (web/components/assistant/agent-host.tsx) renders EITHER the
   docked column OR a floating `Popover`, chosen by `useShellColumns()` (a
   48rem media query) — two structurally different subtrees at the same
   return, so React UNMOUNTS AgentPanel (and this hook with it) the instant a
   window crosses that width, or a tablet rotates through it (many sit
   exactly at 768px in portrait). Every field below used to be a plain
   `React.useState` owned by that one component instance, so crossing the
   width silently destroyed the transcript, the thread, staged attachments
   and a confirm the assistant was mid-way through waiting on — with nobody
   told; the panel just came back empty.

   THE FIX matches the precedent already in this codebase for exactly this
   failure mode — `web/lib/agent-open.ts` (the open flag) and
   `web/lib/agent-dock.tsx` (the dock node) both live outside the React tree
   so a remount can't lose them. `makeCell` below is that same shape
   (a module-level value + a subscriber Set + `useSyncExternalStore`),
   factored once because this hook owns eight such fields where those two
   files each own one — writing it out eight times would be the copy that
   drifts, not the fix.

   NO KEY, ON PURPOSE — matching both files above: the app shows one team's
   assistant at a time (the ACTIVE team), so one shared cell per field is the
   same "one flag, one node" shape they already use, not a Map this hook has
   no reason to keep in sync with anything.

   SIGN-OUT NEEDS NO EXPLICIT CLEARING, for the same reason those two files
   don't have any: leaving the app (the /login boundary) is a genuine,
   full-page reload — "entering or leaving the app is the one real
   navigation" (EDGE-CASES.md §1) — which throws away this whole JS heap,
   this module included. A transcript cannot survive a sign-out because
   nothing module-level here does; the one thing that WOULD leak it is a
   soft, in-SPA route change, and /login sits outside the one client-resolved
   shell that soft-navigation covers. */
