// MCP — the personal access tokens behind the external machine surface.
//
// One of the five door lists behind `@/lib/api`. They are split by WORKER,
// because that is the boundary the doors already have: a path under
// `/api/mcp/…` is answered by the mcp worker and nothing else.
//
// THE WHOLE DIRECTORY IS THE ATTACK SURFACE the two gateway suites derive from —
// workers/gateway/test/agency-door.test.ts walks every file here to prove each
// door reaches a worker, and workers/portal-gateway/test/portal-door.test.ts
// walks the same files to prove none of them reaches the CLIENT door. They read
// the DIRECTORY, not one file, so a door added in a new domain file is covered
// the day it lands.
