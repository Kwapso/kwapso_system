// WAVES — the agency app's doors onto what a client bought.
//
// A file of its own beside the other four, for the reason the barrel next door
// gives: both gateway suites derive the app's whole attack surface from this
// DIRECTORY, so a door added in a new file beside them is covered the day it
// lands. These all answer at `/api/tenancy/…`, which is the tenancy worker and
// nothing else.
//
// EVERY ONE OF THEM REFUSES A CLIENT LOGIN at the worker (a wave is made of
// sprints, and a sprint row is the agency's own delivery record), so none of
// these paths may ever appear on the portal gateway's allow-list.
