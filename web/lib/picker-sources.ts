// WHAT A SERVER-SEARCHED PICKER ASKS FOR — one file, one shape per door.
//
// A `RecordPicker` over a GROWING collection (R14) cannot filter in the browser,
// because the browser only holds page one: typing "Confia" into an in-memory
// filter searches the newest fifty and answers "no" about the rest, confidently.
// So the question goes to the door's own `q`, which is SEARCH.md layer 2.
//
// These live together rather than beside each screen for the reason the same
// three lines used to live in ten dialogs: "which clients may I name?" has one
// answer in this app, and a copy of it in ten files is ten chances for one of
// them to forget `archived` and start offering companies nobody works with any
// more. Each function is one door, asked one way.
//
// THEY NARROW, THEY NEVER WIDEN. Every one of these is the same door the list
// screen reads, with the same gate and the same account fence behind it — a
// picker cannot be shown a row its own caller may not list. Search makes a
// nameable record easier to find; it never makes an unnameable one nameable.
