 * verbatim: "My work: today, tasks, meetings / build: Apps, sprints, stories /
 * accounts: accounts, contacts / kwapso, welcome have no section."
 *
 *   • "my-work"  — the work a person actually does most days: the team's own
 *                  admin, what clients have asked for, and when they're meeting.
 *   • "build"    — the systems being built and the blocks that work was sold
 *                  inside: apps, sprints, the backlog, the packages they sit in.
 *   • "accounts" — who the team works with.
 *
 * Home carries `group: "none"` instead of one of the three — see `NavItem.group`.
 * The grouping is still a fact about a destination, living beside the
 * destination rather than in the shell.
 *
 * "TODAY" AND "WELCOME," RECONCILED AGAINST THE REAL DATA. The client's two
 * words map to the app's ONE landing screen ("Home" — `web/components/screens/
 * home-screen.tsx`, no separate "Today" or "Welcome" page exists anywhere in
 * the codebase; `shared/i18n-strings.json` carries no "Welcome" string at all).
 * "Welcome" is read as Home here: it is the rail's one remaining standalone
 * entry, the same anchor the client's own screenshot showed it as. "Today" is
 * therefore NOT a second, duplicated Home entry inside My work — the rail's
 * own dedupe (`web/test/nav.test.ts`, "a destination appears twice on the
 * rail") treats showing one destination under two labels as the bug it would
 * be for a person clicking around. FLAGGED, not guessed past: if "Today" was
 * meant to be Home MOVING into My work rather than Home being called "Welcome"
 * and staying put, that's a one-line change once confirmed.
 *
 * KWAPSO GOT A FOURTH NAMED SECTION AND LOST IT AGAIN, THE SAME DAY. The
 * client asked for one ("create a new section called kwapso, pages inside
 * (under): team, branding. put this section the last one") and, later on 31
 * Aug 2026, reversed it in as many words: "remove the whole kwapso section
 * from the sidebar and move with your profile and settings." So the section,
 * its heading and its three rows (Details · Team · Branding) are gone from
 * the rail — not folded into one of the three sections above, because the
 * client's own instruction names where they go instead, and it isn't a rail
 * section. See `ProfileMenu` (web/components/shell/profile-menu.tsx) for where the
 * three destinations live now: one "Kwapso" entry landing on `/kwapso`'s own
 * default tab, the same shape Settings already has in this menu —
 * `KwapsoScreen`'s own tab strip (Details · The team · Brand library) is how
 * Team and Branding stay reachable without a second and third menu row each.
 *
 * CONTACTS HAD NO FIRST-CLASS PAGE, until the client answered the question
 * this note used to flag: "contacts as a real sidebar page, also remove the
 * tab from inside accounts" (31 Aug 2026). It is a rail destination now — its
 * own `contacts` module (`MODULE_PERMISSION`), its own recipe
 * (`contacts.list`, screens.ts), the SAME `contacts:read` right the
 * account-scoped tab it replaces already checked. See the `contacts` entry
 * below for the whole of it.
 *
 * THE UNNAMED SIDEBAR PAGES (Knowledge base, Tickets, Work logs, Waves) were
 * not in the client's list. They keep the closest reading of their old half:
 * the three daily ones join My work, and Waves — the shelf a sprint sits
 * inside — joins Build beside Apps and Sprints. */

  // `NavGroup` in this file). So a page's place on the rail is two facts and no
  // third: where its line sits in this list, and which group it declares.
  // Moving a page is moving its line.
  //
  // THREE NAMED SECTIONS, client feedback 31 Aug 2026 — superseding the
  // daily/occasional split fixed 13 Aug 2026 below (kept for the record; the
  // sections it named no longer exist as headings, only as ordering history):
  //   [was] daily       Home · Accounts · Knowledge base · Tickets · Stories · Tasks
  //   [was] occasional  Meetings · Apps · Sprints · Brand library · Settings
  //
  // The new sequence, this list's real order:
  //   My work   Tasks · Meetings · Knowledge base · Tickets · Work logs
  //   Build     Apps · Sprints · Stories · Waves
  //   Accounts  Accounts · Contacts
  //   (none)    Home, Kwapso — see NAV in this file
  //
  // ACCOUNTS MOVED OUT OF THE DAILY SET into a named section of its own — the
  // client's own word for the group is the same as the page's, which reads as
  // one idea rather than two the way "occasional → Accounts" did. MEETINGS
  // moved the other way, UP into My work: the client's explicit list ("My
  // work: today, tasks, meetings") puts it beside Tasks, not beside Apps and
  // Sprints. STORIES moved out of the old daily run to sit with the rest of
  // the work engine in Build (the client's explicit order there is "Apps,
  // sprints, stories" — this list's order IS that order, so the line moved
