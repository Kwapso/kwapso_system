// two screens open that form now: the Tasks list writes a new one, and a task's
// own record CORRECTS one (the edit door, 19 Aug 2026). Two copies of this hook
// would be two forms offering different clients, or one of them missing a
// department the other had.
//
// `teamId` may be null, for a caller who cannot open the form at all: a person
// without `work:update` should not pay four reads for pickers they will never see.
