"use client"

// The ONE web-side read of a RECORD's activity — the client half of Law R5's
// generic (table, id) path: any module's history with no per-module code. It
// carries THREE things because the door already returns all three, and splitting
// them is what let them drift:
//
//   • the rows — page one of the feed, cache-first + live (the live registry's
//     `deps` invalidate this key when the record changes, and the refetch
//     re-primes the total and the cursor below in the same round-trip);
//   • the TOTAL — the exact server COUNT(*) of that record's history, which the
//     Activity TAB badges (R8 says the tab carries the count, R16 says the
//     number is a server total through `formatCount`). The feed is PAGED, so
//     the loaded rows' length is a ceiling, not a total — a record with 200
//     events would badge "50" forever;
//   • the CURSOR — parked in the sidecar <LoadMore> reads, plus the one fetcher
//     that spends it (R14). Without it the badge above told the truth about a
//     feed with no way to reach the other 93 rows: an exact count of what the
//     screen refuses to show is worse than no count at all.

/** One activity row, dressed for the library ActivityFeed. Every record detail

 *
 * `initials` rides here rather than being recomputed at each of the two
 * consumers (the record footer's Latest-activity column, the Activity tab's
 * own feed) — the SAME generic-activity-path law (R5) that keeps this one
 * fetch shared keeps its derived display fields shared too, so a mark that
 * renders blank in one place can't happen while the other gets it right.
 *
 * `timestamp` is `formatRelative` — "2d ago", falling back to an absolute date
 * past a week — the SAME treatment the record footer's own audit column
 * already used one field over (`recordAuditEntries`, record-chrome.tsx). Both
 * consumers used to run this through `formatActivityWhen` instead (a raw,
 * sortable "2026-08-13 13:16"), which is a table-column format and reads as
 * a bug sitting next to a relative phrase — the client's own words, "look at
 * the format of the dates! so wrong / i want them all like now the ones on
 * record." `dateTime` rides alongside it, the raw ISO, for the kit's `<time
 * datetime>` attribute — a human string needs its machine value paired with
 * it, not thrown away. */
