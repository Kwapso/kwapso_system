// TWO DECODE PATHS ON PURPOSE. `createImageBitmap` is the fast one, but it is
// not universally reliable: Safari (including the macOS/iOS web-app runtime)
// throws on perfectly valid files — notably iPhone PNGs and anything carrying
// an unusual colour profile — and some browsers reject HEIC outright. A hard
// failure there reads to the user as "this app can't take my photo", which is
// exactly what happened on the first real sign-in. So we fall back to the
// classic <img> + object URL decode, which is slower but succeeds where the
// modern path gives up. Only if BOTH fail do we surface an error.

// 26,214,400) in which the browser refused a file the server, checking the
// same cap in binary, would have accepted. `KNOWLEDGE_FILE_MAX_BYTES` is
// `shared/workers/limits.ts`'s own name for the one number this app already
// teaches on every other upload door (its own comment says so); it is pure
// constants with no imports, so importing it here costs the browser bundle
// nothing, and `web/components/team/access-tokens.tsx` already reaches into the
// same file for `MCP_TOKEN_TTL_DAYS`. One cap, read once, never retyped.
