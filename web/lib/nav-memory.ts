// WHERE SHE WAS — the app's memory of the place a person left, per top-level
// section, for as long as this document lives.
//
// THE COMPLAINT IT EXISTS FOR (the designer, 27 Aug 2026). She opens Apps, opens
// an app, opens its Tickets tab, goes four records deep with a search and a
// filter and a scroll position at each level — then switches to To-dos to jot
// something down, comes back to Apps, and is at the top of an empty list. She
// multitasks constantly, so she pays that price a dozen times a day.
//
// WHY IT IS FEASIBLE AT ALL. The whole post-auth app is ONE shell that mounts
// once (R37): moving between sections destroys no document, so there is somewhere
// for a memory to live. What it destroys is COMPONENT state — the shell keys its
// content region on `module:recordId`, so every collection's search box, every
// filter, every record's open tab is a fresh `useState` the moment she comes
// back. This module is the place that state can be parked and found again.
//
// ── TWO THINGS ARE REMEMBERED, AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES ─────────────────
//
//   THE TRAIL is just the PATH. Nesting lives in the URL already
//   (`/accounts/CONFIA/apps/A1` — deep-link/route.ts `trailPath`), so "how deep
//   she had gone, and through which records" needs no structure of its own: it
//   is one string per section, and the breadcrumbs rebuild themselves from it.
//
//   THE STATE ALONG IT is per PATH, per SLOT — the open tab, what was typed in
//   a search box, which filters were set, where each scrolled area was. Keyed by
//   the path so every level of the trail keeps its own, and so a path she never
//   returns to simply ages out.
//
// ── THE OWNER'S TWO RULINGS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 1 · SESSION-SCOPED, AND A REFRESH MAY WIPE IT. This is a module-level Map and
//     nothing else: no `sessionStorage`, no `localStorage`, no server. A reload,
//     a reopened tab or a discarded-and-restored tab starts clean, and the owner
//     said plainly that is fine. Persistence would buy the haunted cases — a
//     record deleted while the tab was closed, a filter whose option was retired
//     last week — for a benefit nobody asked for. It also makes two browser tabs
//     correct by construction: each document has its own Map, so they cannot
//     drag each other around.
//
// 2 · IT MUST BE BOUNDED. His words: he does not want a power user accumulating
//     so much remembered state that it slows the app or their device. He named
//     the precedent himself — the paging cache — so this is built to the same
//     shape as `shared/web/store.ts`: a declared ceiling, least-recently-visited
//     eviction, and a size bound on any single entry. An unbounded map keyed by
//     record id is exactly the thing that looks fine for a week.
//
// ── WHERE THE CEILINGS LIVE, AND WHY NOT IN limits.ts ─────────────────────────
//
// `shared/workers/limits.ts` opens by saying what it is: "ONE place for the
// read/write size caps every worker shares" — how many ROWS a door may return.
// Nothing here crosses a door. The two ceilings this app already places on
// BROWSER memory both sit beside the structure they bound — `MAX_CACHED_KEYS`
// in `shared/web/store.ts`, `CLIENT_PAGE_ROWS_CAP` in `web/lib/live-resources.ts`
// — because the number and the eviction that enforces it are one decision, and
// splitting them puts the ceiling one file away from the only code that can
// break it. These follow that precedent.

 * pressing the section you are already in forgets it and returns its top. It is

 * first one: recognising a genuine double-click means holding the first click
 * for the length of the double-click window before acting on it, so every
 * navigation in the app would gain a quarter-second stall to buy a gesture used
 * once a day. It is also the gesture the person already has — a second press on
 * the tab you are on is how every phone's tab bar goes back to the top — and on
