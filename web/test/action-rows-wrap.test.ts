// @vitest-environment node
//
// A pure source scan: it reads files and parses them, and never touches a DOM.
// The workspace's default environment is jsdom, and standing one up costs a few
// seconds of a worker thread that this file has no use for — which is time taken
// off the render tests running beside it.
// ACTION ROWS NEVER CLIP (UI-CONVENTIONS C4) — the half of that rule nothing read.
//
// C4 has been the house rule for every detail header, form footer and toolbar
// since the owner reported a button cut off the edge of his phone: **`flex
// flex-wrap` on the ROW, `ml-auto` on the action GROUP**, and never `justify-end`
// on the parent alone, which pushes the overflow off the LEFT edge where the
// container hides it rather than showing it.
//
// It was written down and enforced by nobody, so the calendar's month controls
// shipped in a row that could not reflow: a segmented control and three buttons,
// about 307px of content against roughly 309px inside the page's padding and the
// collection card's at a 375px viewport. "Next month" was a pixel or two from the
// edge in English and off it in German, where "Agenda" is "Tagesordnung" — and
// there is no scrollable ancestor there, so off the edge is gone.
//
// WHAT THIS CHECKS, and why it is this and not "every flex row wraps". A group
// pushed with `ml-auto` is C4's own signature: it is somebody saying "these
// controls belong together, over on the right". That group is exactly the thing
// that ends up off the edge, and it has two honest shapes — it wraps ITSELF, or
// it sits in a row that wraps around it (which is the right answer when the
// group's own members must stay side by side, like Previous and Next). Anything
// else is a group that cannot reflow.
//
// ANCESTRY IS READ FROM THE SYNTAX TREE, not from indentation or a window of
// characters: "the row this group is in" is a question about the JSX, and the
// compiler is already a dependency here (catalogued-strings.test.ts reads the
// app the same way).
