// COMING BACK TO THE SAME QUESTION — the half of the nav memory a unit test
// cannot reach by reading the store, because it is about what a CONTROL does
// when it mounts for the second time.
//
// `nav-memory.test.ts` proves the store is bounded and forgets in the right
// order. This proves the two things that decide whether the feature is any use
// or actively harmful:
//
//   • the search she typed and the filters she set come BACK, and the door is
//     asked the same question it was asked before she left;
//   • a filter whose option has been retired while she was away does NOT come
//     back, and does not take the rest of her question down with it.
//
// The second is the corner this whole feature lives or dies on. A remembered
// value is a fact about a world that has moved: a dropdown value retired, a
// column no longer offered. Restoring one blindly asks the door for a word it
// does not know, which is a clean 400 on a screen that looks like a search.
