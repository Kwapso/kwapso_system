// THE APP REMEMBERS WHERE SHE WAS — AND FORGETS ENOUGH OF IT.
//
// The designer's complaint (27 Aug 2026): four records deep into Apps with a
// search, a filter and a scroll position at each level, out to To-dos to jot
// something down, back to Apps, and everything is gone. She multitasks
// constantly, so she pays that a dozen times a day.
//
// The owner's second ruling is what this file is mostly about, and it is a hard
// requirement rather than a nicety: he does not want a power user accumulating
// so much remembered state that it slows the app or their device, and if there
// is any risk of that there must be a mechanism that removes it. He named the
// precedent himself — the paging cache, which keeps a bounded amount and lets
// the rest go (web/test/cache-bounds.test.ts is its test, and this is written
// to match).
//
// A MAP KEYED BY RECORD ID IS THE SHAPE THAT LOOKS FINE FOR A WEEK. So the walk
// below is deliberately punishing: far more sections than the rail offers, far
// more records than an afternoon touches, every one of them carrying state.
// What it proves is not that the numbers are right — it is that SOMETHING
// enforces them, which is the difference between a ceiling and a comment.
