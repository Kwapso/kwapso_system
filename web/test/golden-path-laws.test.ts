// THE GOLDEN PATH CANNOT FALL BEHIND THE LAW-BOOK.
//
// `BUILD-A-MODULE.md` is the document somebody follows end to end to add a team
// module, and it ends with a promise: "a module that ships without these turns
// the build red." That promise is only worth anything while the list is the whole
// list. On 5 Sep 2026 it named twenty of fifty-one, and the thirty-one it did not
// name were, almost exactly, the ones added since it was written — which is to
// say the ones a NEW module is most likely to trip over. Following the document
// produced a red build the reader then debugged one law at a time: R28/R33 first
// (any label they wrote was a sentence the catalogue did not have), then R36
// (a `TEAM_MODULES` key offers four permission boxes and something has to decide
// them), then R48/R50, R39, R40/R41, R21.
//
// Nothing detected that, because a document going stale is not a behaviour and no
// test in this repo read the golden path at all. This is the check that makes the
// list self-maintaining: EVERY id in the registry must be named in the file. A
// law added tomorrow turns the build red until the golden path names it.
//
// Deliberately no exemption list. A law a new module can safely not know about is
// a category this repo does not have — RULES.md's own framing is that these are
// the conditions of shipping — so an escape hatch here would only ever be used to
// avoid writing one sentence.
