// A STALE TAB HEALS ITSELF, AND SAYS SO.
//
// Earned on 2026-08-17, on staging, three rows in `error_logs` forty seconds
// apart: `Loading chunk 67631 failed.`, place `ErrorBoundary`, all three on
// `/apps/01KZXD6DQZSEYS5D39QHHDAM9T`, the middle one with a hand-typed `?v=2`
// on the URL. That query string is the whole bug report — it is what somebody
// does when an app is broken, reloading has not helped, and they are trying to
// out-think the cache.
//
// The app SHIPPED a guard for exactly this (`version-watch.tsx`) and the guard
// never fired, because it was listening to `window.onerror` and
// `unhandledrejection` while the failure arrives through React's RENDER phase —
// a lazy route's import rejects, React consumes the rejection, and neither
// event is ever dispatched. The ErrorBoundary is the only thing in the tree
// that sees it, and all it did was print the chunk id at a manager.
//
// So the invariant is not "chunk errors are handled". It is: THE ONE THING THAT
// SEES A STALE SHELL HANDS IT TO THE ONE THING THAT HEALS IT — and having done
// so, never spins.
