// R33 — EVERY EXTRACTED POSITION ASKS FOR ITS TRANSLATION.
//
// R28 (catalogued-strings.test.ts, beside this one) makes the CATALOGUE match
// the code. It cannot make the code read the catalogue, and on 2026-08-18 the
// difference between those two sentences was 666 positions:
//
//   • every form field label in the app — 138 of them,
//   • 119 of the toasts, including every "Couldn't save …",
//   • both error boundaries, which are the screens a person sees when something
//     has already gone wrong,
//   • and most dialog titles, because they are written as a ternary.
//
// All of them were in `shared/i18n-strings.json`. Most of them had German. None
// of them asked for it, so all of them rendered in English, in every
// languages, under a green build. R28 was satisfied throughout — a catalogue can
// be perfect and every screen still English, because "is this string EXTRACTED?"
// and "does this position CALL t?" are different questions and only the first
// one had ever been asked.
//
// THE SAME ONE DEFINITION, so the two laws cannot drift. `visitStrings` reports
// a `kind` for every position it finds, and `t-call` is one of them (it exists
// so that wrapping a string does not delete it from the extraction). So this
// check is R28's walk read the other way round: a position whose kind is NOT
// `t-call` is a sentence in the source that no translator will ever be asked
// about. A second definition of "a string a person reads" would be the exact
// failure R28's own header warns about.
//
// TWO WAYS OUT, AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT IN KIND.
//
//   1. POSITIONAL — a `label:` / `helpText:` on an object that spreads a field
//      config. `t` is a HOOK, a field config is a module-level constant, so
//      `t("Team name")` genuinely cannot be written where those words live; that
//      is WHY none of the 138 was ever wrapped, and it is the one class of
//      string in this app a developer could not have fixed by remembering to.
//      They are translated on the way to the screen instead, by
//      `shared/web/field.tsx` — the same ruling `translateRecipe` already makes
//      for the recipes. The object says what it is (`...defaultFieldConfig`),
//      the way R20 identifies a checked field and R29 a page container.
//
//      That exemption is only sound while the seam cannot be walked around, so
//      the second half of this check is an IMPORT BAN: nothing in either front
//      door may import `Field` from the library directly. An import cannot be
//      forgotten the way a `t(` can (R24's reasoning, in a smaller place).
//
//   2. PINNED — a copy TABLE, read back through `t` somewhere else. Data in
//      `TRANSLATED_WHERE_READ` (shared/rules/registry.ts), keyed by file and
//      narrowed by kind, each with the `via` call that does the reading. Rot-
//      checked both ways, so the list can only shrink.
//
// WHAT THIS LAW DOES NOT REACH, said plainly because a law that overstates its
// cover is worse than one that admits a gap: it stands entirely on the positions
// R28's walk can SEE. A sentence written somewhere the walk does not visit — a
// `const title = cond ? \`…\` : "…"`, a positional argument, a property name
// outside the closed list — is in neither the catalogue nor this census, and
// both laws pass on it. That blind spot is R28's to widen (its own header names
// the last time it was), and every widening lands here for free.
