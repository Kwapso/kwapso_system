// R15, THE CLAUSE A GREEN BUILD MISSED — a record's OWN cache key is reached by
// the ping about that record.
//
// The law says every published resource reaches a listener, and it was true: a
// `stories` ping patched the row in the stories LIST and refreshed the activity
// feed. But `story-detail.tsx` does not read its row out of the list. It fetches
// the one story into a key of its own, `story:one:<id>`, and a row patch cannot
// reach a key nothing names.
//
// So starting a timer moved the story to In progress on the server, published the
// ping, patched the list, refreshed the feed — and left the open record saying
// "Open" until somebody reloaded the page. The owner watched it happen on 19 Aug
// 2026 and asked whether it was a network glitch. It was not.
//
// `knowledge-detail.tsx` had the same shape and got it right — `knowledge:one:`
// is in its own registry entry's deps. One module remembered, two forgot, which
// is the definition of a rule that needs a machine. The census found the second
// (`meeting:one:`) on its first run, in a branch a reader would have to notice:
// the meeting detail reads its row from the LIST when the meeting is on the page
// it has, and only falls back to a one-fetch when it is not — so the bug was
// invisible for exactly the meetings somebody browses to and live for every
// meeting they deep-link into.
//
// THE CENSUS IS POSITIONAL, like R20's. A per-record key is a template literal of
// the form `<word>:one:${…}`; wherever one is read, that prefix must appear in
// live-resources.ts. Reading the KEY rather than the screen is what makes this
// survive a screen being renamed or split in two.
