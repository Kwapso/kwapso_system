// R29 — EVERY EMAIL IS CLASSIFIED, AND ONE THAT NAMES A RECORD CARRIES THE WAY
// BACK TO IT.
//
// EARNED BY A SENTENCE. The mention notice read "Open the ticket to read the full
// conversation and reply" — in an email with no link in it, and no email in the
// fleet had one. The copy instructed an action the message made impossible, and it
// had done so since the notification path was written, because nothing in the build
// could tell the difference between an email that links and one that only talks
// about linking.
//
// SO THE DELIVERABLE IS THE CENSUS, NOT THE BUTTONS. Buttons fix twelve emails; the
// thirteenth, written next year, ships the same way. This reads the SOURCE for every
// function that composes a branded message and demands a classification for each
// one — the shape R27's vocabulary and R13's exemptions already use, in both
// directions, so an unclassified send is red and a census line for a send that no
// longer exists is red too.
//
// AND IT IS WHERE THE FRONT DOOR IS DECIDED. "Which hostname does this go to" is a
// security question wearing a formatting question's clothes: staff read the agency
// app, a client contact reads the portal, and the same ticket therefore has two
// addresses. An agency URL in a client's inbox is a link they cannot open and a
// door they may not pass, advertised (R21). Hence the last three cases here: no
// origin at a call site, no portal link built from an agency-only helper, and no
// worker linking clients anywhere without the portal's own address configured.
