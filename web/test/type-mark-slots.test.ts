// THE FOUR SLOTS THE TYPE MARK STILL CANNOT SIT IN — flagged, and now READ.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHAT THIS IS FOR
//
// UI-CONVENTIONS §5 (amended 17 Aug 2026) defines a TYPE MARK: one glyph, set as
// DATA on the team's own dropdown value, sitting in the slot a kit icon would
// take and never inside a sentence. CHECKLIST 11.8 asks for one on every
// collection and 21.6 asks for glyphs on the main screens. Both shipped PART
// DONE, and both stop at the same wall in four places: the slot does not exist
// in the component library. That wall was a SEPARATE repo this one never edited;
// since 2026-08-22 the library is vendored into `shared/ui/` and the wall is
// ours, which changes what these four entries are asking for — not another
// repo's roadmap, but four slots this codebase can add whenever it decides to.
//
// UI-GAPS.md has carried those four as prose since. Prose is where a flag goes
// to rot in two directions at once:
//
//   • THE LIBRARY SHIPS THE SLOT and nobody here notices. The gap entry stays,
//     the screens stay bare, and the fix that arrived is a fix nobody applied.
//     This is the likelier of the two — the library is somebody else's release
//     note, and nothing in this repo reads it.
//   • THE ENTRY DESCRIBES A COMPONENT THAT HAS MOVED ON. A "one-line fix" that
//     names a function which no longer exists is a promise nobody can keep, and
//     it reads exactly like one that can.
//
// So each of the four is asserted against the INSTALLED library source, in both
// directions: the slot is still missing, AND the thing the entry says is already
// there really is there — because "the fix is one line" is the load-bearing half
// of every one of those entries, and it is the half that goes quietly false.
//
// A FAILURE HERE IS GOOD NEWS. It means the library shipped the slot, and the
// message says what to do: use it, and delete the UI-GAPS line in the same
// commit. This list can only shrink.
//
// IT READS THE LIBRARY SOURCE, DELIBERATELY — and since 2026-08-22 that source
// is `shared/ui/`, in this repo, rather than `node_modules/@kwapso/ui`. The
// reason is unchanged and is now simply more true: what is on disk is what this
// app is built against, and asking a published changelog what version we run
// would be asking a different question from the one that matters.
//
// One thing about these four entries DID change with the move, and it is worth
// saying plainly. "The fix is one line" used to mean "one line, in a repo we do
// not own, on their release schedule". It now means one line, here, today. So a
// failure below is no longer news about somebody else's library — it is a slot
// this repo added and has not yet used.
