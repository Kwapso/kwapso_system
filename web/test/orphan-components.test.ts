// A FINISHED COMPONENT NOTHING MOUNTS IS NOT A FEATURE, IT IS A RUMOUR.

// Found twice on 26 Aug 2026, both by outside review rather than by any check:
// portal-access-dialog (121 lines, superseded by PortalAccessPanel in the panel
// pivot, then unmounted for weeks) and mail-reply-dialog (deliberately parked —
// see PARKED below). The reachable-screens suite walks DOORS to controls; it
// never asked whether a component file is reachable AT ALL, so a superseded
// dialog looked exactly like a live one. This census closes that: every file
// under web/components is imported by something — statically, or through the
// one dynamic() split the bundle-size work introduced — or it is PARKED here
// with the reason, rot-checked so the list can only shrink.
