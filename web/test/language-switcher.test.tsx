// THE TWO LANGUAGE SWITCHERS — one shape rule and one sentence rule.
//
// THE SHAPE. Twenty-nine languages arrived as twenty-nine buttons, wrapping to
// six lines of flags across the middle of Settings. The control is a Select now,
// and it is the LIBRARY's Select (R3: nothing in this app hand-rolls a menu, and
// a row of buttons that behaves like one is the shape R3 was written about). The
// portal's compact twin is the library DropdownMenu for the same reason.
//
// THE SENTENCE, which is the one that was a real bug. A switch is OPTIMISTIC:
// `setLang(next)` re-renders the app before the save comes back. But `t` was
// bound when the component rendered, so a confirmation written through it says
// "Language changed." in the language they just LEFT — a small thing that tells
// somebody the feature is a veneer. And the FAILURE has to go the other way: a
// switch to Catalan that did not happen must be reported in the language they
// can still read, because telling somebody in Catalan that Catalan failed to
// load is a joke at their expense. So the success is composed in `next` and the
// refusal in `previous`, and both are asserted here rather than left as a
// comment that was true once.
//
// Read off disk, this repo's house style for a rule about how a file is written.
