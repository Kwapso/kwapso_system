// THE GENTLE WARNING, AS PAINTED — and, more to the point, as REACHED.
//
// The owner asked for "a gentle, well-done warning" because every model failure
// arrived as one sentence telling him to try again in a moment, which is wrong
// advice for three of the four things it covered. So there are two questions
// here and only the second one is about pixels:
//
//   1. does the REASON actually travel? worker → wire → state machine → screen.
//      Every link is silent when it breaks: drop the reason anywhere along it
//      and the app shows the old generic bubble, which is exactly what it did
//      before and exactly what nobody notices.
//   2. does each reason say a TRUE and DIFFERENT thing? A classification that
//      renders one sentence for four causes is the bug wearing a taxonomy.
//
// No model is called. The failure is forced onto the wire, which is the only
// honest way to test a path whose real trigger is somebody else's outage.
