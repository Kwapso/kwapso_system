// THE RAIL'S COLLAPSIBLE GROUPS — and the two controls that must not be confused.
//
// The owner asked why the collapsible sidebar groups had been removed. NOBODY
// REMOVED THEM: they were never built. The rail has drawn named groups since
// grouping landed, and no heading or chevron ever shipped in any bundle. What
// Aurora specified is `shared/ui/compositions/templates/rail.tsx` ch.26.02:
// "Grouped sections with a collapse chevron per group", and "Group collapse
// (chevron, left) is separate and persists per user". This locks that it is
// now what the app does.
//
// R45 (composition adoption) is why the disclosure itself lives INSIDE the
// vendored `Rail` composition rather than a hand-rolled `<Collapsible>` in
// this file: `Rail` renders every named group itself, inside one `<nav>`
// (COMPOSITION_EXEMPT["templates/rail.tsx"] was deleted the day this shipped
// — a composition genuinely reached is stale as an exemption). So what this
// file can assert is structural on the APP's side of that seam: which prop
// wires the group state, what it is keyed on, and that the collapsed rail
// degrades to the divider it has always been rather than losing its entries.
//
// TWO CONTROLS, AND THE CHAPTER SAYS SO ITSELF:
//   · the GROUP fold — per group, persisted under `ss-rail-closed-groups`;
//   · the RAIL collapse — the whole rail to icons, persisted under
//     `ss-sidebar-collapsed`, and the one the owner said not to break.
// A test that only knew about one of them would go green while the other was
// deleted, which is precisely the confusion the chapter is warning about.
//
// Read off the disk rather than rendered: `AppShell` mounts a whole application
// — the team switcher, the permission sheet, the live socket — and a render here
// would be testing the harness. What is being asserted is structural: which
// control exists, what it is keyed on, and that the collapsed rail degrades to
// the divider it has always been rather than losing its entries.
