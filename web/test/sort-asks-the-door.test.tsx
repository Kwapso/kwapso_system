// THE CLIENT HALF OF A SORT THAT PAGES.
//
// `workers/content/test/paged-sort.test.ts` proves the door orders the whole
// collection. This proves the four things the SCREEN has to get right for that
// to reach anybody, and each is a way to have a working door and a broken list:
//
//   1. AN UNTOUCHED SCREEN ASKS FOR NOTHING. It reads the collection's own cache
//      key and pages the collection's own cursor, exactly as it did before
//      sorting existed. A screen that sent its default on mount would fetch the
//      same rows into a second cache key every time somebody opened it.
//   2. CHANGING THE ORDER ASKS THE DOOR, with the name and direction the door knows.
//   3. …AND STARTS AT PAGE ONE, because a changed order is a changed question and
//      lands in a cache key of its own, with its own cursor sidecar. This is the
//      one most likely to be got subtly wrong: a screen that carried the old
//      cursor over would ask for "everything after Bergman S.A." in a
//      newest-first read and get back a page that looks like an answer.
//   4. GOING BACK to the order it started in asks nothing again — the collection's
//      own rows are still there, untouched, underneath.
//
// It drives the DIRECTION TOGGLE rather than the field picker: the toggle is an
// ordinary button with an aria-label, while the picker is a Radix popover over
// cmdk, and a test that fights a portal proves less about this component than it
// does about jsdom. Flipping the direction is the same code path — one
// `onChange`, the same query, the same key.
