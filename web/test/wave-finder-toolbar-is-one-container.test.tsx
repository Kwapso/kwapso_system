// WAVEFINDER'S OWN TRACK GETS THE SAME "ONE CONTAINER" FIX `ToolbarRow` DOES.
//
// See `web/test/paged-find-toolbar-is-one-container.test.tsx`'s own header for
// the client ruling (2026-09-03, verbatim: "merge this with the main toolbar
// so that it's one single background or container, more like expand behaviour
// rather than open-a-new-one behaviour") and the shape it forbids. `WaveFinder`
// (this file's own subject) is the THIRD hand-drawn copy of the same track —
// alongside `ToolbarRow` (screen-bits.tsx) and `PagedFind` — and it carried the
// identical unfixed shape: `rounded-pill bg-background` on the track itself,
// unconditionally, with the open panel one `gap-2` below it as a second
// sibling of the same tone. Waves is the one screen whose toolbar is this
// component rather than `ToolbarRow` or the frame's own, so nothing else
// caught it.

/** THE TRACK'S SHAPE, with the one attribute that is SUPPOSED to change
 * normalised away.
 *
 * This assertion exists for the client's "one container" ruling: opening the
 * filter panel must not make the pill move, resize or repaint. `outerHTML`
 * was a fair proxy for that — until the add-filter button gained
 * `aria-expanded` (kit v1.2.42), which flips false→true precisely BECAUSE the
 * panel opened. That is a state announcement for a screen reader, not a
 * visual change: a person watching the pill sees nothing move, and a person
 * listening finally hears that the control expands something.
 *
 * So the comparison drops `aria-expanded` and keeps everything else byte for
 * byte — a class, a style, a structural change or a second attribute flipping
 * still fails it. Normalising the whole attribute (rather than asserting one
 * expected value) is deliberate: the point here is that the track did not
 * move, and the aria state has its own test elsewhere. */
