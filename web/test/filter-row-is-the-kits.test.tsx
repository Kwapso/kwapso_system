// THE FILTER ROW IS THE KIT'S, AND THE WAYS IT COULD QUIETLY STOP BEING.
//
// THE FINDING THAT EARNED THIS FILE (2026-08-27). The design kit has shipped
// `components/filter-bar/filter-bar.tsx` — exporting `FilterBar`,
// `SearchableFacet` and `RangeFacet` — since it landed, and NOTHING in `web/`,
// `web-portal/` or `shared/web/` imported a line of it. The app had hand-written
// its own three, under the SAME THREE NAMES, in `shared/web/screen-engine/`. So
// every other control in this app converged with the designer's build by
// construction, and this one could not: we were not drawing her component at
// all, and no check could tell, because a file called `filter-bar.tsx` exporting
// `FilterBar` is exactly what a correct adoption looks like from the outside.
//
// That is why the first assertion below is about IMPORTS rather than markup. The
// kit's own vendoring guard (`vendored-kit.test.ts`) proves the kit is
// unmodified; `kit-supplies-the-ui` (R39) proves nothing ELSE supplies a
// control. Neither can see a control the kit supplies and the app declines.
//
// The rest are the ways the adoption could survive as an import and die as a
// behaviour, each one measured in a real browser on the day it was written and
// each one invisible in a screenshot. Three of them are the client's rulings of
// 2026-09-02, and the FIRST of those is here because it had already broken
// twice with nothing catching it:
//
//   · THE PANEL EXPANDS THE SPACE. An open filter panel pushes the collection
//     down and the toolbar's own pill does not change shape. Pass one made the
//     panel a flex child of the pill and drew a giant oval; pass two made it
//     `position: absolute` and it floated over the rows. Both were shipped,
//     both were caught by a person looking at a screenshot, and nothing in this
//     suite could see either. It can now: the test below opens the panel and
//     asserts the pill track's own subtree is BYTE-IDENTICAL open and closed.
//   · THE TOOLBAR SAYS A COUNT, NEVER THE FILTERS. No chip for an active facet,
//     anywhere in the row.
//   · THE THREE PILLS ARE ONE FAMILY. Filter's box matches sort's and view's,
//     derived from the kit's own source at both ends rather than pinned.

   THE FILTERS CASCADE — client ruling, 2026-09-09.

   Her screenshot: Client "Any client", App "Kwapso Portal", and underneath
   "Nothing matched. Try fewer words, or clear the filters." Verbatim: "very
   wrong! filter the apps by selected client! Until clint is not selected, show
   nothing." — "filter by selected client only!" — "whe using fulters this is
   how they shoudl work: is client has sth (f.e. Kwapos) the filter apps should
   only show apps of this client. and so on".

   WHAT THESE TESTS ARE FOR, given the ruling is already written out at length
   on `FilterFacet.dependsOn` and in the adapter's own header. Every one of the
   three behaviours below is INVISIBLE in a screenshot of a correct screen and
   invisible to every census in this repo: a prop-presence check (R48/R50/R53's
   shape) can see that a facet exists and cannot see which options it offers,
   and the whole fault she reported was a control offering the wrong ones. So
   they are driven through the real hook, in a real DOM, off real values.

   THE FOURTH IS A CENSUS, and it guards the one thing a declaration can get
   wrong silently: a `dependsOn` naming a facet that is not in the same row
   leaves a control that can never be unlocked — permanently reading "Choose a
   client first." beside no Client control at all.
