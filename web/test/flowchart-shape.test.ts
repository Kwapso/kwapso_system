// THE SHAPE A PROCESS MAP DRAWS, from three columns and no graph table.
//
// The owner's own proposal for how a fork is stored: "Isn't there a way that we
// can give two forking nodes that are at the same position and the same number?
// Let's say that there is one node at position number two and two nodes at
// position number three. We know the split happens after position two."
//
// So POSITION IS THE WHOLE LAYOUT. One step at a position is an ordinary row;
// two or more are branches of the decision above them; and they REJOIN where a
// single step appears again — which needs no marker at all, because the column
// count returning to one IS the join. A graph table would hold the same fact and
// cost a join on every read.
//
// This tests the grouping rather than the drawing, because the grouping is the
// only decision in the file: everything after it is arithmetic over the ranks.

// add step number four underneath it in the same split. I don't want it to be a
// join step."
//

// single step below is the rejoin — so a fourth step meant to continue ONE arm
// got a row of its own, and a row with one step in it IS the rejoin by this
// model. It drew itself centred under both arms and read as a join, which is the
// one thing it was not.
//
// `branchOf` is the third thing the shape can say: the step key of the branch
// HEAD this step continues. The picture library has drawn branch chains since it
// landed (`FlowBranch.chain`); nothing here had a fact to feed it.
