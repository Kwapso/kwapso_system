// THE CRASH-CLASS GUARD (React #310/#300): a hook called BELOW a top-level early
// return renders fine until the day the early return fires first — then the hook
// count changes between renders and the whole tree white-screens. The fix for one
// file is hoisting; THIS check makes the class unshippable at any size: it walks
// every component/hook function in web source and fails any use*() call that
// appears after an early return in the same function. Worth more than any single
// fix — the containment half is the ErrorBoundary in the root layout.
//
// A SCANNER WITH A BLIND SPOT IS A CHECK THAT IS SILENTLY OFF, so the scanner is
// itself locked by fixtures below. Three real blind spots have been found this way
// (each waved a whole file through): a `React.`-namespaced hook; a destructured
// param's `{` mistaken for the body; and — the subtle one — a guard written the
// ordinary way, `if (!ready) {\n return null\n}`, whose return sits at brace depth
// 2 and so never registered as a return at all. Hence the rule the walk now uses:
// a return counts unless it is inside a NESTED FUNCTION (a callback's own return
// is its own; an `if`/`try`/`switch` block's return is the component's).
