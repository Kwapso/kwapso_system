// THE SPACING SCALE IS A CLOSED SET, AND THIS IS WHAT CLOSES IT.
//
// The design kit's ruling 28 gives layout eleven steps on a 4px grid — 4, 8, 12,
// 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128 — plus four half-steps on a 2px sub-grid for
// inside a component (6, 10, 14, 18), "and there is no fifth". Only 1px and 2px
// live off the scale, as grid lines and optical nudges, never as layout.
//
// Tailwind's default spacing ramp is a SUPERSET of that: it also offers 28, 36,
// 40, 44, 56, 80 and more, all one keystroke away and none of them in the
// system. So the kit's scale is not something to configure, it is something to
// refuse — which needs a check, because nothing about typing `gap-10` looks
// wrong and the result is a 40px gap in a system that has no 40.
//
// WHAT IT FOUND WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN: seventeen sites, and one of them had an
// argument attached. `lg:px-10` was the shell's page gutter, with a comment
// saying it was "exactly the brand site's own 40px --margin--m". It snapped to
// 32 anyway, because the kit IS the brand's design system now and its page
// padding step is 32; a value inherited from the old site is exactly the kind of
// thing a re-theme is for. Every snap is listed in RESKIN-REPORT.md.
//
// IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT POLICE h-* / w-* / size-*. A control's height is not
// layout rhythm — the kit fixes those separately (32 dense, 38 field-in-a-row,
// 40 control, 44 touch row, 56 table row), and folding them in here would report
// every one of them as a violation of a scale they were never on.

// by page, but rather you change the rule and you apply it everywhere."

// ZERO, written out at three separate call sites for a folder-tab overlap that
// no longer exists. Now both read one custom property, and this is what stops
// either side quietly reverting to a number of its own — the failure is SILENT
// in both directions: an undeclared `var()` computes to nothing and simply
// removes the space again, and a hard-coded step back in either file would
// still pass the scale check above, because 20px is a perfectly legal step.
