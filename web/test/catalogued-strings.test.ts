// R28 — EVERY STRING THE APP SAYS IS IN THE CATALOGUE, AND THE CATALOGUE SAYS
// NOTHING THE APP DOESN'T.
//
// The pipeline that translates this product into the languages it speaks is keyed
// by the
// ENGLISH sentence (shared/i18n.ts): what a developer types at the call site is
// what the catalogue is keyed by and what the translator translates. That makes
// the whole thing depend on one fact staying true — that `shared/i18n-strings.json`
// is exactly the set of sentences in the source — and until now nothing checked
// it. A screen written on a Tuesday spoke English to a German reader, silently,
// under a green build, until the next person remembered to re-run a script.
//
// TWO FAILURES, NAMED SEPARATELY, because they are two different mistakes:
//   • MISSING — a sentence in the source that is not in the catalogue. That
//     string ships untranslated. This is the one the law is for.
//   • ORPHAN — a catalogue entry no string in the app matches. Nothing breaks
//     today, and that is exactly why it rots: a deleted screen's sentences stay
//     in the file, get translated on every build, and make the catalogue a
//     record of what the app USED to say. The same ratchet reasoning as R20's
//     exemption list and R27's vocabulary.
//   • A LANGUAGE THE APP NO LONGER SPEAKS — a translation on disk for a code
//     that is not in `LANGUAGES`. `shared/i18n.ts` calls that array the one
//     place a language is decided, and it was true of everything DERIVED from
//     it and false of the two files that accumulate. Dropping a language left
//     its 1,027 translations in the bundle, in every catalogue diff, and in the
//     header sentence claiming how many languages this app speaks. The fix is
//     `node scripts/i18n-prune.mjs`, which only ever REMOVES — filling a
//     language in costs money and is `i18n-translate`'s job, not this one's.
//
// IT RE-RUNS THE REAL EXTRACTOR rather than re-implementing it. `scripts/lib/
// i18n-source.mjs` is the ONE definition of "a string a person reads" — it is
// what the extractor writes from and what the adoption codemod wraps — so a
// check with its own idea of that would be a second definition, and the day the
// two drifted this test would pass while the app spoke English. The walk is a
// TypeScript parse of both front doors and takes about a third of a second.
//
// THE FIX IS ONE COMMAND, and the failure says so: `node scripts/i18n-extract.mjs`.

// walk does not visit is missing from both sides and the check passes on it.
// There is a second way to be invisible, and it is cheaper to fall into: the
// walk was six hand-written folders, so a sentence escaped by living in a file
// somewhere else. It cost, silently, under a green build:
//
//   • `formatRelative` (shared/web/format.ts) returned "just now", "5m ago",
//     "3h ago" and "2d ago" in English to NINE call sites across BOTH front
//     doors. `t("Created by {name} · {when}")` translated its own half of the
//     record footer and rendered *Erstellt von Aurora · 5d ago*.
//   • The whole language settings screen and the whole text-size section live
//     in shared/web/, already wrapped in `t(...)`, in no catalogue. They only
//     looked finished because the SEED carried three of the twenty-nine of the time
//     languages by hand.
//   • shared/scale.ts holds "Compact", "Comfortable" and "Large", rendered
//     through `t(step.label)` with the English one directory outside the walk.
//
// So the folder list is gone (`appFiles()` is the front doors' own import
// closure) and these two checks stand behind it. Both are DERIVED — one from
// the disk, one from the walk's own predicate — because a folder list cannot be
// made correct, only current, and "current" is exactly what nobody notices
// going stale.
//
// A file the walk does not reach and that says something a person reads is a
// reasoned line here, and the list is a ratchet: an entry that no longer
// offends turns the build red, so it can only shrink.
//
