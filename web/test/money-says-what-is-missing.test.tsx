// A BLANK WHERE A NUMBER SHOULD BE IS THE BUG.
//
// The owner opened an app's Value tab: "I did open it, and I was able to see
// hours, but I was not able to see money given back." The money was on screen —
// it said 0.00 — and nothing said why, or what to do about it. Since 25 Aug
// 2026 the money is the ONE savings seam's own step arithmetic (each step's
// saving times the client-role rate frozen onto it — the same figure the map
// shows), so exactly one link can be missing: a map none of whose steps names
// a role. The screen has to name it and offer the door to it, and say partial
// coverage on the row it qualifies.
//
// The door's half is proved against a real database
// (workers/tenancy/test/app-money-chain.test.ts). This is the screen's half: it
// mounts the real panel over each state of the payload and reads what a person
// would actually see. A test that scanned the source for a sentence would pass
// on a sentence rendered inside a branch nobody reaches.
