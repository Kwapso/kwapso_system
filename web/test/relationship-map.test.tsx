// THE RELATIONSHIP MAP, on the two things a drawing like this gets wrong.
//
// The fence is not here — the door removes an edge whose far end the caller may
// not read, both ends checked, and does not count it either
// (workers/content/test/record-map.test.ts). This component draws what it is
// given. What IT can get wrong is everything about being a picture:
//
//   1. A FORCE SIMULATION IS ANIMATION. The layout runs to convergence BEFORE
//      the first paint and the settled positions are what is drawn, so there is
//      no convergence to watch, for anybody. A reader with a vestibular disorder
//      gets the same map as everybody else rather than a quieter version of it,
//      and there is no second code path to drift.
//   2. POSITION IS THE INFORMATION, AND POSITION DOES NOT NARRATE. Focusable
//      circles are necessary and nowhere near sufficient: a screen reader handed
//      this control gets a bag of names and no relationships. So the same payload
//      is rendered a second time as sentences, REACHABLE rather than hidden —
//      a text equivalent nobody without a screen reader can find is one nobody
//      ever checks, and it is also the only rendering you can click to GO
//      somewhere, because a line between two circles is not a link.
