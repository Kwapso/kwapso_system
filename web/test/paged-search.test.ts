// R14, THE SEARCH HALF — a paged collection's search box reaches past the cursor.
//
// The law's own check (bounded-lists, in rules.test.ts) proves a growing
// collection PAGES and that a client can reach page two. It says nothing about
// the search box on top of that list, and that box was the same bug wearing
// different clothes: the library frame filters the array it holds, so on a paged
// screen typing a name searched the loaded fifty and answered "nothing" about
// everything past the cursor — under an exact badge (R16) counting all of it.
// Reported from staging as "it only searches on loaded screen".
//
// So, for every GROWING collection with a list screen (data — read off
// GROWING_COLLECTIONS, never hand-listed here):
//
//   1. its DOOR parses `q`, so there is something honest to ask;
//   2. its recipe does NOT leave the frame's own search box on, so the screen
//      cannot ship two boxes where one of them lies;
//   3. its screen wires a <PagedFind> to that collection's own cache key — the
//      same "the control and the key are one control" test bounded-lists makes
//      of <LoadMore>, and for the same reason: a file mentioning both strings
//      somewhere proves nothing.
//
// And one seam check: the FILTERED total renders through `formatSearchTotal` in
// exactly one place. A collection total and a filtered total are different
// numbers with different rules (only the second may end in "+"), so a screen
// computing its own would be the beginning of two answers to one question.
