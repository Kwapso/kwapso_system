// THE SOURCE CHIPS — which doors one conversation reads from.
//
// A chip that ticks and unticks is trivial. What matters is what the chips MEAN
// at the two places a mistake would be silent, and both are here:
//
//   1. "NOTHING NAMED" IS EVERY DOOR, NEVER NONE. All six are on by default, so
//      "nothing named" is exactly what a person who has never touched them
//      sends. Reading it as "search nothing" would turn the default state into a
//      base that answers no questions — and it would do it quietly, because a
//      refusal is a legitimate answer here (R23).
//   2. EVERY CHIP HAS A WORD. A key with no label renders as `records` or
//      `portal_login` on screen, which is what the Kind filter did before
//      somebody noticed.
//
// The narrowing ITSELF — that naming a chip really changes which passages come
// back — is proved where it happens, against a real index and a real database:
// workers/content/test/knowledge-coverage.test.ts, mutation-proved by deleting
// the clause. This file is the half that lives on this side of the wire.
