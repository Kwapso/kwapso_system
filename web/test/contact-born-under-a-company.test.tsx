// A PERSON IS BORN ON A COMPANY'S CONTACTS TAB, and this drives the real screen
// to prove it — the two writes it makes, the words it fills in, and what it says
// when the second one fails.
//
// It is a companion to accounts-are-companies.test.tsx, which holds the OTHER
// half of the same ruling (18 Aug 2026: every account somebody creates is a
// company). The two halves are one decision and the second one is load-bearing:
// taking the Type selector off the account form removed the only way to create a
// person in the whole app, so if this tab ever stops making one, the Add contact
// search beside it becomes a picker over a set nobody can add to.
//
// SEPARATE FILE because it needs a whole screen's worth of mocked seams, and a
// blanket `useCached` in the file next door would make those dialog tests lie
// about which read they were answering.
//
// It drives the screen rather than reading its source for two reasons. "Fills in
// individual" is a value that has to REACH the door, and "creates the person,
// then links her, then keeps its head when the link fails" is a sequence — source
// can show both lines are present and nothing about the order or the recovery.
