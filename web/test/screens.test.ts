     * matches `{ ...recipe, … fields: …` with `[^}]*?` in the middle — so the
     * first host to put an OBJECT between the spread and its fields (a nested
     * `{…}` in a prop, a `columns` map inline) closes the character class early
     * and the match is lost, silently, on the very screen that needed
     * checking. Two host-composed tables today (`tasks-screen.tsx`,
