// WORK IS WRITTEN DOWN ON THE TICKET THAT ASKED FOR IT, and this drives the real
// screen to prove it: the button exists, it is gated on the right the STORY door
// asks for, and the story it writes arrives already attached to the request.
//
// WHY A DRIVEN TEST AND NOT A SOURCE SCAN. The fault this file exists to stop was
// a COMMENT: the ticket's Related stories tab carried three lines describing "a
// collection with its own create action" above a panel that was handed no create
// action at all, and the panel drew the button only when it was. Every source
// scan in the repo would have read those three lines and the `<StoriesPanel>`
// beside them and reported all clear — which is exactly what happened, for a
// month. A test that presses the button cannot be fooled by prose.
//
// AND IT IS NOT "MAKE IT A STORY". That control (and the prompt after triage)
// went on 17 Aug 2026 and is not coming back: a ticket never BECOMES a story. The
// last case below is the one that keeps the two apart in code rather than in
// somebody's memory — the ticket is untouched by this, which is precisely what a
// conversion could never be.
