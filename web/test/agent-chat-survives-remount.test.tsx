// THE REMOUNT THIS HOOK MUST SURVIVE.
//
// AgentHost (web/components/assistant/agent-host.tsx) renders EITHER the docked column
// OR a floating `Popover` — two structurally different subtrees at the same
// return, picked by `useShellColumns()`'s 48rem query — so crossing that
// width (a window drag, a tablet rotating through its own portrait width)
// UNMOUNTS AgentPanel and mounts a fresh one. `useAgentChat` used to be plain
// `React.useState` owned by that one component instance, so the crossing
// silently destroyed the transcript, the thread, staged attachments and a
// confirm the assistant was mid-way through waiting on.
//
// This locks the fix directly, at the level the bug actually lived: build a
// transcript with a staged attachment and a paused confirm, UNMOUNT the hook
// (exactly what a breakpoint crossing does to the component that calls it),
// mount it again, and check nothing was lost. No component or media query is
// rendered here — agent-host.test.ts already locks that AgentHost picks the
// presentation by width; this proves the STATE survives the remount that
// choice causes, regardless of how the width is decided.
