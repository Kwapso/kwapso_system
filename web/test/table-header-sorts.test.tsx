// A COLUMN HEADER MOVES THE ROWS, or it is not a control.
//
// ── THE BUG THIS IS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Reported on the deployed build with a screenshot: Tasks → List, 80 rows, the
// Deadline header showing an active descending arrow, and the rows in the DOOR's
// order — one priority-4 task dated a year out sitting on top of 79 priority-1
// rows that ascend by deadline underneath it. The header was lit and the list had
// never moved.
//
// The mechanism was one line of the library. `DataTable` keeps the header's
// choice in its own state and pushes it down to `CollectionFrame` as a config
// prop; the frame seeds its sort from that prop ONCE, at mount
// (`React.useState(config.sortBy)`), and orders by its own state ever after. So
// the value the header wrote was read by nobody, on every column of both tables
// in the app. The arrow moved because the arrow is the header's own state; the
// rows did not because the rows are the frame's.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE IS SHAPED LIKE THIS ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The comparison was already correct and already tested. `formatDateSortable`
// landed the same day, with a passing test, so that "2026-04-14" sorts after
// "2025-12-01" — and none of it could ever be seen, because the screen never
// asked anything to sort. A green test on a helper the screen does not call is
// how this shape ships three times in one day.
//
// So NOTHING here tests a comparator. Every assertion is about the ORDER OF THE
// RENDERED ROWS BEFORE AND AFTER A PERSON CLICKS, read out of the DOM of the real
// screen — the one fact a working helper cannot fake and a lit-up dead control
// cannot pass.
