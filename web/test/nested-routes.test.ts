// A NESTED ADDRESS KEEPS ITS TRAIL — the half of deep linking that was parsed
// and then thrown away.
//
// THE OWNER'S REPORT, 24 Aug 2026: "when I click into related records, instead
// of opening in a nested format, it just goes to that page and opens that link,
// so there's no way to go back and see my breadcrumbs or nesting."
//
// He was right, and it was broken at BOTH ends of the same feature:
//
//   • `parseScreenPath` has always returned an ARRAY of levels — the grammar
//     supported `/accounts/BERG/stories/S12` from the beginning. `parseRoute`
//     read `levels[0]` and dropped the rest, so a nested address parsed
//     perfectly and then rendered the OUTERMOST screen.
//   • and the panels never built one anyway: they stripped the collection
//     segment off the path (`basePath.replace(/\/accounts$/, "")`) before
//     appending, so opening a story from a client deliberately left the client
//     behind.
//
// Half a feature at each end is why this reads as "we cannot resolve it" — each
// half looks reasonable on its own and neither one works without the other.
//
// These lock the parsing half. The DEEPEST level is what renders, because that
// is what the person asked for; the trail is kept because that is what says
// where they asked for it from.

// ── A MAIN SCREEN CARRIES NO TRAIL. ONLY A DETAIL SCREEN DOES ────────────────
//
// SHELL.md's own line: "a main screen is in the navbar; a detail screen has
// breadcrumbs." Override 73 (2026-08-26) struck the OLD breadcrumb bar for
// repeating the identity chips' own two facts, not for existing outright — so
// when a record's own trail turned out to be genuinely missing, the fix that
// restored it (earlier the same day as the one below, 31 Aug 2026) dropped the
// gate entirely instead of correcting it. The SAME one-line trail then drew on
// every flat COLLECTION screen too — Sprints, Accounts, Tasks, reachable
// straight from the sidebar — a bar reading nothing but the section's own
// name, above a screen whose title already says it and a sidebar that already
// shows it. The client, on a screenshot of exactly that: "kill breadcrumbs in
// main screens!"
//
// THE WIRING, NOT THE FUNCTION, again: `buildCrumbs` has always been capable
// of returning a short, honest one-crumb trail for a bare collection (see
// crumbs.ts's own topLevel branch) — that is a valid answer for a NESTED
// collection ("Confia › Stories", above), and the wrong one for a screen with
// nothing above it at all. The defect both times was in whether the CALLER
// asks for a trail in the first place, not in what `buildCrumbs` hands back
// when asked — so this reads the caller, the same way the nesting regression
// above does.
// OVERTURNED 2026-09-03. Everything above is kept because the reasoning is
// still sound about the object it was reasoning about — a TEXT BAR above the
// content, repeating in words what the title and the sidebar already said. That
// object no longer exists. The trail is now a strip of FOLDER TABS whose last
// tab is filled with the card's own paper and joined to it: not a sign pointing
// at the card, but the card's own edge.
//
// Aurora, shown a top-level collection drawn with one tab reading "Apps" over a
// card titled "Apps", and told in as many words that every top-level screen
// would gain a tab it does not have today: "On a top-level collection, we would
// only have one tab, and that's correct. There would be nothing on the left.
// That's correct."
//
// So the gate is gone and every screen carries its trail. What these two tests
// now guard is the half that did NOT change: that the caller still asks
// `buildCrumbs` for the trail rather than hand-rolling one, which is what both
// historical regressions actually turned on.
