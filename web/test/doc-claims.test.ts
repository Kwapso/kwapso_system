// THE DOCS MUST AGREE WITH THE ROSTER ON DISK.
//
// Earned by: a doc sweep that had to correct "seven workers" and "one public door"
// in fourteen places at once, two months after the eighth worker (the client
// portal's front door) shipped. Every one of those sentences was true when it was
// written. None of them was checked, so none of them was updated — and a runbook
// that says "delete the seven workers" leaves a public address live.
//
// So the roster is DERIVED, never listed here: the worker names come from
// `workers/` on disk, and which of them are public comes from each
// `wrangler.jsonc`'s own `workers_dev` flag. Add a worker and this test's
// expectations move on their own; the docs that disagree go red the same day.
//
// Deliberately NARROW. It reads two claim shapes and no others:
//   1. a COUNT OF WORKERS  — "eight workers", "8 workers", "8-worker split"
//   2. a COUNT OF PUBLIC DOORS — "two public doors", plus the handful of stale
//      phrasings that used to say there was one
// It does not police every number in every doc. A check that shouts about prose
// gets switched off, and a check that is off is worse than no check at all.
//
// A genuine SUBSET claim ("the six workers that bind the core DB") is legitimate
// and stays legitimate — it is a reviewed line in SUBSET_CLAIMS below, with the
// reason, exactly like every other deny-list in this codebase.
