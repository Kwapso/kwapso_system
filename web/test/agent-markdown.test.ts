// ── A TABLE STAYS INSIDE ITS BUBBLE ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The owner screenshotted the assistant panel on 1 Sep 2026 with a table pushing
// the whole conversation sideways and its right-hand columns cut off. Measured
// live on staging at 375px, in the browser, before touching anything: the
// wrapper around the table was 504px wide with a scrollWidth of 504 — so
// `overflow-x-auto` had NOTHING to scroll, because the box had grown to its own
// content — and the bubble around it was 540px inside a column of 241.
//
// THE CAUSE IS A PAIR, WHICH IS WHY THIS TEST IS A PAIR. The table carries a
// 28rem floor so it does not crush into one word per cell (added 31 Aug 2026
// after exactly that, and correct). Every ancestor up to the chat bubble is
// SHRINK-TO-FIT, and `min-w-0` lets a box shrink without stopping it being sized
// by its contents — so the floor travelled straight up and widened the bubble.
// `contain: inline-size` is the one word that stops it: the wrapper's width
// stops depending on what is inside it, the bubble sizes to the prose beside the
// table, and the scroll finally engages. Measured after: wrapper 205 with
// scrollWidth 504, bubble 241 in its 273 column, document scrollWidth back to
// the viewport's own 375.
//
// A FLOOR WITHOUT CONTAINMENT IS THE BUG, so neither half may be removed alone.
// Read off the disk because layout is not something jsdom can be asked about —
// this locks the two classes that have to travel together, and the browser
// measurement above is what says they are the right two.
