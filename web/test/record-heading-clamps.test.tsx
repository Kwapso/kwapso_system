// A RECORD'S NAME DOES NOT TAKE THE SCREEN.
//
// The owner opened a ticket on 1 Sep 2026 and got roughly 1,800 characters of
// German prose set at the heading step, filling the viewport before one field of
// the record. The cause is measured and is NOT "somebody wrote a long title":
// on staging's Kwapso team database, `help` holds 2,050 rows, 1,040 with no
// English title and 286 with no title in either language, and the ticket screen
// falls back to the DESCRIPTION when a ticket has no title of its own. Six
// titles in the whole table are over 120 characters. A missing-title problem
// wearing a long-title costume.
//
// The backfill is its own item. This is the other half, and it has to hold for
// every record type rather than for tickets: the name is clamped to two lines,
// and the full text stays reachable — the record's own body still renders it,
// and the clamped node carries the whole string as its `title` attribute.
//
// TWO SEAMS, ONE DECISION. Both places the app hands a record heading to the kit
// go through `clampRecordHeading`, and this reads that off disk rather than
// trusting a comment: the twelve bespoke details (web/components/records/record-chrome.tsx)
// and every recipe-driven detail on BOTH front doors
// (shared/web/screen-engine/screen-renderer.tsx). Deleting either call site
// turns this red.
