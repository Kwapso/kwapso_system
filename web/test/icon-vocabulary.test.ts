// EVERY ICON NAME THE APP STORES AS DATA RESOLVES TO A GLYPH THE KIT DRAWS.
//
// Most of this app's icons are not imports. A tab carries a name, a nav page
// carries a name, a screen recipe carries a name, an empty state carries a
// name — because a recipe is serialisable and a component is not. The names
// were lucide's, and they were safe because `kitIcon` fell back to lucide's
// runtime `DynamicIcon` for anything the kit had not drawn.
//
// On 2026-08-27 the kit's art became the Iconoir pack, and on 2026-09-03 it
// became Phosphor (client ruling — see shared/ui/foundations/icons/
// ATTRIBUTION.md). Both times, some fraction of the stored names existed
// under the new pack's spelling or not at all, and the lucide fallback (now
// deleted) used to mean a name like that kept quietly rendering LUCIDE art —
// next to the new pack's art, on the same strip, with `npm run check` green.
// That is the failure this file exists to make impossible: an unresolvable
// name draws NOTHING, and a name that draws nothing turns the build red HERE
// rather than appearing as a hole on a screen.
//
// NO ALIAS TABLE any more (2026-09-03 client ruling, verbatim: "i don't want
// to keep translating — i want to be able to go on the website from phosphor
// and give you the name there"). Every name this file censuses IS a name on
// phosphor.dev, PascalCased by `kitExportName`
// (shared/web/screen-engine/icon-names.ts) — nothing sits between the two any
// more, so there is nothing left here to rot-check in a second direction.

/** COMMENTS OFF, at the one seam every scan in this file reads through.
 *
 * `indirections()` builds an ALLOW-LIST — a name that is a CONCEPT_ICON key is
 * SKIPPED by the vocabulary check, because it resolves through the table rather
 * than naming a glyph directly — and it was reading pages.ts raw. So a block
 * comment inside CONCEPT_ICON granted any name it listed. Proved 27 Aug 2026:
 * an `icon: "zzznotaglyph"` in a component is caught ("the kit draws no such
 * glyph"), and stops being caught once pages.ts carries
 *   \/*
 *   zzznotaglyph: "home",
 *   *\/
 * inside that table. What it buys is a HOLE where a glyph should be, on screen.
 *
 * The other direction is fixed here too, for free: `vocabulary()` collects
 * `icon: "…"` off every component, so a commented-out icon name used to enter
 * the census and demand a glyph nothing draws — a false failure rather than a
 * silent pass, but noise in a law is how a law gets ignored.

 * Every read in this file feeds a census or a table. None asserts absence, so
