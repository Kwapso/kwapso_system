// shared/web/rich-text.ts is the RENDER SECURITY BOUNDARY, in two halves:
//
//  • sanitizeRichHtml — user-authored article HTML (the Notes editor). What it
//    returns is injected into the page, so it must keep formatting but drop
//    scripts, inline handlers, and unsafe links.
//  • safeHref / safeSrc — the URL half. A person types an article's linked
//    resource; the assistant writes links into its replies (and the assistant is
//    steerable by anything it read). Neither may reach an href or a src unchecked.
//
// These lock both halves, plus the source-level rule that no screen may bind a
// user-supplied URL to an attribute without going through the seam.
