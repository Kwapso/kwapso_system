// IF A MODULE'S READS REFUSE A CLIENT LOGIN, SO MUST ITS WRITES.
//
// R21 is enforced (`client-reachable-doors` in rules.test.ts) and it asks exactly
// the right question — "can a caller holding the Client role's rights pass this
// door?" — which means it stops at every door the shipped role cannot reach.
// Eleven agency-only WRITE doors sat in that shadow: the learning library (since
// purged), the
// dropdown vocabulary and the team's own record each had `refusePortalCaller` on
// EVERY read door and on NOT ONE write door.
//
// Nothing was leaking. The seeded Client role holds no write right, so the doors
// were refuted as findings — and that is precisely the objection. R21's own text
// says the refusal belongs at the door "so it does not depend on how carefully a
// role was built", and an owner who ticks `brand_assets: edit` on their client role
// is one checkbox away from a client editing the agency's how-to library. A
// defence that survives only because of a permission matrix somebody may change
// tomorrow is a defence with a date on it.
//
// So this asks the question R21 cannot: for each module, do the two halves AGREE?
// Nothing is hand-listed — the modules are discovered from the read doors that
// already refuse, and the writes are found in the same file.
