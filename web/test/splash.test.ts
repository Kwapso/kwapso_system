// THE OPENING FRAME HAS FIVE WAYS TO FAIL SILENTLY, AND ALL FIVE LOOK FINE ON
// THE MACHINE THAT WROTE IT.
//
// A boot loader is the one piece of UI nobody notices working and everybody
// notices stuck. It is on screen before any of our code runs, it is the first
// thing anybody sees of this product, and every one of its failure modes is
// invisible in a dev build:
//
//   1. It mounts on ONE door. The agency app opens on the brand and the client
//      portal opens on a white flash — the same class of half-rebrand that made
//      shared/web/pwa.ts a single file, found only by whoever happens to open
//      the other hostname.
//   2. It is not in the exported HTML, so nothing is on screen until the bundle
//      lands — which is the entire wait it exists to cover. A loader that waits
//      for JavaScript has failed at the one job it has.
//   3. It is in the HTML but it does not MOVE until the bundle lands, which
//      looks exactly like a frozen logo and has shipped here twice.
//   4. Somebody swaps `splashSource` to a video on a CDN, and the screen that
//      exists to hide a network wait becomes a network wait.
//   5. THE REASON THIS FILE HAS A JSDOM SECTION. The animation is not CSS — it
//      is four kilobytes of JavaScript injected as script TEXT, and script text
//      is not type-checked, not linted and not parsed until a browser reaches
//      it. A stray comma in it is a build that passes every check in this repo
//      and a boot screen that is a frozen logo. So the last describe RUNS the
//      thing: it evaluates the shipped string, mounts it on the shipped markup,
//      and drives the clock.
//
// AND THERE USED TO BE A SIXTH, WHICH IS WHY HALF THIS FILE IS SHORTER THAN IT
// WAS. Two copies of the mark animated at once on every boot: a fixed
// full-viewport overlay (`#ks-splash`) with its own animator run, its own opaque
// field and its own 3.8-second timer, and — behind it, invisible for about 2.7
// seconds of that — the app's own `MarkLoader`. It cost roughly a third of the
// frame rate at 20× CPU throttle. The overlay is deleted, and with it every case
// here about a sheet leaving the screen: its tap-to-skip, its safety timeout,
// its fill mode, its theme pre-resolution. A loading screen that IS the page's
// content is taken away by React when there is something to show, so the whole
// question "how does this get out of the way again" no longer has an answer to
// get wrong. What replaced those cases is the one below that says there may only
// ever be ONE run on a host, enforced by the animator rather than by agreement.
//
// So: both layouts derived from their own source, the stylesheet and the script
// read as the shipped strings, the score proved to be a WARP of the author's
// composition rather than a rewrite of it, and the animator actually executed.

// in the middle of the opening frame of both front doors. Thirty-four green
// tests and a clean `npm run check` said nothing, because none of them had ever
// looked at a built file.
//
// So this one looks at the built file. And for two months it read a file that
// was usually not there: it SKIPS when `<door>/out/` is absent, a fresh clone has
// no export, and `npm run check` never builds — so the one guard covering a fault
// no other test in this repo can see was also the one most likely to be silently
// absent at the moment somebody asked "is it green?". A skipped test and a passing
// test print the same colour on the way to a deploy.
//
// SO THE GATE BUILDS FIRST. `npm run check:built` (package.json) runs the real
// static export of both doors and then re-runs this file with REQUIRE_EXPORT=1,
// which turns "there is no export" from a silence into a failure. It sits on the
// deploy path itself — `deploy:staging` and `deploy:production` call it instead of
// `npm run build`, so the export these bytes are read out of is the very export
// about to be uploaded — and it is listed in OPERATIONS.md's "Verify before
// shipping", which is the list `/ship-staging` reads and runs. `npm run check`
// stays as fast as it was; the build is bought once, on the path that was already
// paying for it.
//
// AND IT READS BOTH DOORS. The mangling that shipped was in a string both front
// ends inline from the same module, and only the agency app's export was ever
// looked at — the same one-door blindness this file's own failure mode 1 is about.
/** Is the exported HTML older than the source that generates it?
 *
 * `npm run check` does NOT build, so once an export exists on disk these cases
 * compare CURRENT source against a build from whenever somebody last ran one —
 * and after a deploy, that is always older. The failure then reads "the animator
 * was altered between the source and the export", which is the sentence for a
 * minifier mangling the script: the exact thing this test exists to catch, and
 * the exact wrong conclusion. It cost real time twice in one night before this
