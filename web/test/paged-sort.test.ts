// SORTING A LIST THAT PAGES, the wiring half.
//
// `workers/content/test/paged-sort.test.ts` proves the BEHAVIOUR — a row that is
// not on page one arrives at the top when you sort by it, and the whole
// collection still walks. This file proves the two things that behaviour rests
// on and that a single door's suite cannot see:
//
//   1. THE SCREEN AND THE DOOR OFFER THE SAME NAMES. A sort travels as a name
//      (`sort=deadline`), so a screen offering an option the door's menu does not
//      hold is a control that produces a clean 400 the moment somebody presses
//      it — a dropdown entry that looks like every other one and simply breaks.
//      The door's menu is read off its own source, exactly as R19 reads a door's
//      filters, so nothing here is hand-paired.
//   2. EVERY PAGED LIST SCREEN HAS THE CONTROL. Paging that no one can reach is
//      dead code wearing a law's clothes (R14's own words); an ordering the door
//      can do and no screen asks for is the same thing one verb along.
//
// …plus the two rules an ordering has to answer to on the way past: a sort name
// never reaches a statement unchecked (R20), and a menu on a door a client login
// can pass names nothing a client may not already read (R18/R21/R24).
