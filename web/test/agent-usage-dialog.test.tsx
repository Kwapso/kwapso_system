// The row mapping this dialog hands to the library ActivityFeed had two silent
// bugs: no `initials` (every mark rendered a blank circle) and `timestamp:`
// instead of the feed's actual field, `time:` — a plain object literal assigned
// to a typed const doesn't get TypeScript's excess/wrong-property check, so
// `npx tsc --noEmit -p web` stayed green while every row showed no time-ago
// text. This drives the real dialog rather than reading the mapping function,
// so it proves what the feed actually RECEIVES, not what the source intends.
