// EVERY NEW ACCOUNT IS A COMPANY, AND A PERSON IS BORN ON ONE.
//
// The owner's ruling of 18 Aug 2026 reversed his own of the day before: the Type
// selector comes off the account form, creating always makes a company, and a
// contact created under one is always a person — "the default value that gets
// populated in that column will be individual".
//
// The column stays. `accounts.account_type` is a live CHECK constraint and the
// thing that decides which of the two screens an account gets, so what changed is
// who ANSWERS the question: the form used to, and now the code does.
//
// AND THE PARENT PICKER WENT WITH IT, same day, same sentence: "each new account
// created will be its own thing. It will have no parent because it's literally a
// brand new company." That one is not carried through the form at all, because
// `updateAccount` never reads the field — a move is its own door — so there is
// nothing for a silent form to zero.
//
// Five claims, and each one is here because it could rot on its own:
//
//   1. the form offers no way to choose  — a SOURCE claim, because a behaviour
//      test passes whether or not the control is on screen: nobody drives a
//      control they cannot find, so a selector that came back would sit there
//      green. This is the only claim source is the right instrument for.
//   2. creating always sends `entity`     — including over a draft saved while
//      the selector still existed, which sessionStorage will happily restore.
//   3. editing a person sends `individual` back — the field is still sent, so
//      "stops asking, keeps sending" must send the record's own answer, not
//      yesterday's default. This is CHECKLIST 3.13's failure, in this form.
//   4. the new-contact form asks no type question at all, and hands back only
//      what a person and their link are made of.
//   5. the form offers no way to choose a PARENT, and does not carry one — the
//      same source claim as 1, for the same reason: a control nobody can find is
//      a control nobody drives, so a behaviour test would sit green beside it.
//
// The other half of claim 4 — that the caller writes "individual", links, AND
// sets the parent, and stays honest when the second write fails — is
// account-detail's `createContact`, driven below.
