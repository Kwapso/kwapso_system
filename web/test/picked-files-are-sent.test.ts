// R41 — A FILE SOMEBODY PICKED IS EITHER SENT OR REFUSED, NEVER DROPPED.
//
// R40's sibling, and the boundary between them is the whole point: R40 asks
// whether a STORED file reaches a person. Here nothing is stored, so R40 is
// silent by construction — the bytes never leave the browser, there is no row,
// no object, and nothing to recover from. It is the worse failure of the two and
// the one no existing law could see.
//
// WHAT IT CATCHES, AND WHY IT IS AWKWARD. A create dialog cannot upload while
// the person is typing, because R2 is addressed by the record's id and on a
// create that id does not exist yet. So `StoryFormDialog` holds the picked files
// and hangs them on whatever `onSubmit` HANDS BACK:
//
//     const target = storyId ?? (typeof madeId === "string" ? madeId : null)
//     if (target && pending.length) await attach(target, pending)
//
// Three of the four create call sites did `await createStoryFrom(...)` and threw
// the id away. `target` was null, the `if` was false, and the file was dropped in
// silence — story created, success toast, no error anywhere. `createStoryFrom`
// has returned the id since the day the upload was written; the callers simply
// did not pass it on.
//
// THE SHAPE IS A DISCARDED RESULT, not a missing call, which is harder to census
// than anything R40 does — there is no absent function to look for, only a value
// that goes nowhere. So this is deliberately NARROW rather than elegant: it
// enumerates the dialogs that defer an upload to their submit, finds every call
// site off the disk, and asks of each CREATE site that the id actually comes
// back. An honest small law that can be checked beats a general one that cannot.
//
// DERIVED, so the fifth call site arrives red: the census is every
// `<StoryFormDialog` in the components tree, and whether a site is a CREATE is
// read from the absence of the `storyId` prop — the same fact the dialog itself
// switches on, so the check and the code cannot disagree about which sites are
// at risk.

/** The JSX attribute's whole expression, brace-balanced.

 * A REGEX CANNOT DO THIS, and it is worth being exact about why, because the
 * first version of this note got the direction wrong and was believed. The real
 * call sites nest — `createStoryFrom(teamId, { ...v, sprintId }, t)` — so a lazy
 * `onSubmit=\{([\s\S]*?)\}` stops at the OBJECT LITERAL's brace, three lines
 * before the `return`. Measured on the real source, not reasoned about:
 *
 *   captures → "async (v) => { const madeId = await createStoryFrom(teamId, { ...v, sprintId "
 *   sees `return madeId` → false
 *
 * So the failure it causes is a FALSE FAILURE — every correct call site reported
 * as dropping files — not a vacuous pass. That is the noisy kind of wrong, which
 * gets noticed and then gets the check deleted, and a deleted check is a vacuous
 * pass with extra steps. Fail-closed either way: an `onSubmit` this cannot read
 * is pushed as an offender below rather than skipped.
 *
 * Pinned by a case in the suite, so swapping this for a regex goes red. */
