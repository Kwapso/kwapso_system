// R33, PROVED BY RENDERING — a form field label reaches the screen in German.
//
// Every other assertion about this reads source off disk, which is the right
// shape for a law and the wrong shape for the one question a person actually
// asked: does the label on the form say Vorname? Source-reading could tell us
// the seam is imported and the catalogue has the word, and both were true of a
// build that put "First name" in front of every German reader for months — the
// call site simply never asked. So this one is a real React render, in jsdom,
// through the real provider and the real catalogue, reading the real DOM.
//
// PROFILE, deliberately: `firstField` and `lastField` are module-level constants
// (`{ ...defaultFieldConfig, label: "First name" }`), which is the exact shape
// that could not be wrapped — `t` is a hook and there is no component around a
// module constant. If these two labels are German, the 138 like them are too.
//
// NOTHING IS STUBBED except the network, which this form only touches on submit.
// The words come from `shared/i18n-catalogue.ts` as it ships.
