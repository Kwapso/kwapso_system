// THE APP SPEAKS THE KIT'S MOTION, OR IT SPEAKS NOBODY'S.
//
// `shared/ui/foundations/motion/motion.css` ships a whole vocabulary — page and route
// transitions, row enter/exit/move, hover, hover-lift, drag, disclosure,
// dialog, sheet, scrim, pull-to-refresh, progress — and both front doors
// import it. For a year the app used exactly ONE of its classes,
// `motion-panel-in`, and drew everything else with a hand-rolled Tailwind
// `transition-colors`.
//
// That is not a missing animation. It is a SECOND motion system: Tailwind's
// 150ms linear beside the kit's `--duration-colour` on `--ease`, on surfaces
// that sit next to each other. Nobody files that as a bug, because nobody sees
// two hovers at once — which is exactly the argument R32 makes about colour
// drift, and the reason this is checked rather than remembered.
//
// So: a hand-rolled transition utility in `web/`, `web-portal/` or
// `shared/web/` is a breach. The kit's class is the spelling.
//   · a fill or ink swap  → `motion-hover`
//   · a card that is a link, a draggable card, the copilot launcher, and
//     nothing else (motion.css §13) → `motion-hover-lift`
//   · a row              → `motion-row-hover` / `-enter` / `-exit` / `-move`
//   · a route's content  → `motion-page-in`, on the content and never on the
//                          chrome
//
// The exemptions are DATA with a reason each, and they are rot-checked: a pin
// whose file no longer carries a transition turns this red, so the list can
// only shrink.
