/** R2 / R8 — THE BESPOKE RECORD DETAILS, READ OFF THE CODE.
 *
 * A law that enumerates its subject from a hand-kept list has a hole by
 * construction, and this one's opened twice. `RECORD_DETAIL_COMPONENTS` in the
 * registry was that list: R2 and R8 walked exactly the screens somebody had
 * remembered to type into it. `app-detail` and `process-detail` were added on 17
 * Aug 2026 after a tester found faults on screens no law had ever read; `sprint-
 * detail` and `story-detail` were found missing on 18 Aug, having shipped tabs
 * and an Activity panel that neither law had ever looked at. Nothing was red
 * either time. A screen that no law walks looks precisely like a screen that
 * passes.
 *
 * So the subject is derived, the way R8 already derives which collection a badge
 * describes. TWO INDEPENDENT SIGNALS, because either alone has a gap:
 *
 *   BY NAME       `web/components/**\/*-detail.tsx` — the convention every one of
 *                 them already follows, and the one the hand-rolled-feed check
 *                 below has always used.
 *   BY BEHAVIOUR  it renders an `<ActivityPanel>` — a record's own history feed,
 *                 which nothing but a record detail has any business drawing. This
 *                 catches the detail screen that arrives under some other name.
 *
 * AND THE SIGNALS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT THE OBLIGATIONS, so nothing here is
 * circular. R2 demands TabsView *and* ActivityPanel; a file caught by NAME is held
 * to both with neither assumed, which is the case that actually bites — a new
 * `foo-detail.tsx` shipped without tabs turns this red. A file caught only by
 * BEHAVIOUR has satisfied one of the two by definition, and is still held to the
 * other, and to every per-tab count R8 asks for.
 *
 * `RECORD_DETAIL_NOT` (registry) is the reasoned residue, rot-checked below.
 *
 * COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED FIRST, as every source scan here does (CONVENTIONS.md).
 * Not housekeeping: R8's tab scan matches `{ value: "…" … badge: … }`, and
 * `story-detail` writes three lines of comment between the brace and the value,
 * so on the raw text its Work logs tab simply was not there. A tab a law cannot
 * see is a tab with no count and nothing red — the same shape as the screens this
 * census was written to stop losing, one level down. The blindness tripwire below
 * is what surfaced it. */

  // those (the search) and in what order (the sort) — and on a PAGED collection
  // all three have exactly one honest place to be answered: the door. The search
  // box learned that in August; the column headers learned it on 18 Aug; the
  // FACETS were still narrowing the fifty rows the browser was holding.
  //
  // Reported the same day: the owner filtered the knowledge base by "From a
  // meeting" and was shown TWO sources. The door, asked properly, answers 52 and
  // the app holds 170 meetings. Page one happened to contain two of them, so the
  // screen reported two — under a badge (R16) correctly counting all 3,000-odd
  // sources. Nothing was broken; the filter was simply answering a question about
  // a window nobody could see the edges of.
  //
  // FOUR CLAUSES, because the control can be lost at four different points and
  // each of them looks like a working screen from the outside:
  //
  //   1. THE RECIPE DECLARES NONE. `{ field: "kind" }` on a recipe means "the
  //      `kind` property of the loaded row objects"; the same five characters in
  //      lib/collection-filters.ts mean "the `kind` parameter the door parses".
  //      They are indistinguishable to a reader and answer different questions,
  //      so a paged recipe may not carry the first kind at all.
  //   2. THE DOOR PARSES WHAT IS OFFERED. Derived from each door's own
  //      `searchParams.get` calls, exactly as R19 derives a tool's filters — a
  //      facet naming a parameter no door reads is a dropdown that quietly
  //      changes nothing.
  //   3. THE SCREEN WIRES THEM, into the <PagedFind> holding THAT collection's
  //      own cache key. A file mentioning both strings somewhere proves nothing
  //      (R14's own blind spot, and paged-sort.test.ts says the same).
  //   4. THE QUESTION REACHES THE DOOR WHOLE. This is the one that had already
  //      gone wrong invisibly: `content.knowledge` took the find's whole question
  //      and copied three named fields of it into a URL, so when sorting arrived
  //      and put `sort` in that question, the knowledge base's sort control
  //      changed the cache key, refetched the same rows in the same order, and
  //      looked like it worked. Nothing enumerates now — the screen spreads
  //      `...query` and `listQuery` forwards every key — and this is what keeps
  //      it that way.

  // workers/content/test/validate.test.ts" — which locks the helpers' behaviour
  // and the QUERY-string half, and excludes workers/auth outright. Auth is
  // exactly where an unauthenticated 500 was found: POST /api/auth/email/start
  // with {"email": 123} crashed before the send throttle and wrote an error row
  // into the GLOBAL core database on every request. Every other law had a real
  // scanner; the one about never trusting a request body had prose.
  //
  // THE RULE IS POSITIONAL, and that is deliberate. An earlier auth-only version
  // matched the shape of the bug (`body.x ?? ""`), and a cast — `(body.email as
  // string) ?? ""` — walked straight past it. So a body field may appear ONLY
  // where something is CHECKING it: as the first argument of a validator from
  // shared/workers/validate.ts, as the operand of `typeof`, inside
  // Array.isArray()/Number(), in a strict comparison against a literal, or as
  // the needle of an allow-list `.includes()`. A cast occupies none of those
  // positions, so it cannot launder a field.
  //
  // Comments are stripped first (stripComments above): this repo comments
  // heavily and its comments discuss the very fields being scanned — a rule

  // a `search` prop", never whether the REST of the row (`actions`, the
  // create button above everything else) agreed with it. A
  // `<ToolbarRow search={data.length > 0 && …} actions={canCreate &&
  // <AddButton/>} />` passed R48 outright — `search` genuinely was gated —
  // while still drawing a lone, floating "+" the moment the collection held
  // zero rows, because `actions` was never asked the same question. Found
  // seven more times once this law's own census went looking: Sprints'
  // Overview/Calendar toolbar, Waves' own finder, a wave's own Sprints tab,
  // Deliverables, Modules, all three of Client-org's lists, Dropdown values,
  // and Triage's toolbar (drawn by a PARENT component that could not see
  // whether the CHILD's own fetch, two components away, held a single row).
  //
  // THE FIX IS CENTRAL, not fourteen more per-call-site patches: `empty` and
  // `restingEmpty` are REQUIRED props on `<ToolbarRow>` and `<PagedFind>`
  // respectively, checked FIRST, before any other slot — so a caller cannot
  // gate `search` correctly and forget `actions` the way every one of the

  //
  //   i.   Both components' OWN source still gates on the prop, unconditionally,
  //        ahead of every other slot — the CENTRAL guard this law leans on,
  //        so a future edit that moved the check after `actions` would be
  //        caught here rather than trusted forever.
  //   ii.  Every `<ToolbarRow>` call site (the same brace-depth scan R48/R49
  //        use) passes an `empty` prop, or is named in `EMPTY_TOOLBAR_EXEMPT`.
  //   iii. Every `<PagedFind>` call site passes a `restingEmpty` prop, or is
  //        named in the same registry.
  //
  // `<SectionWithCreate>`'s own header create button is NOT censused the same
  // way: every current call site already passes `folderTabs` or `useKitPanel`,
  // either of which suppresses that button through its OWN, older mechanism
  // (`showCreateInHeader`), so the shape this law is about — a create button
  // with no gate on the collection's row count — cannot occur there today.

   * THE SUBJECT IS DERIVED, never listed. A record detail is drawn by rendering
   * the kit's `<RecordDetail>` (components/record-detail) or its `<RecordChrome>`
   * template, and this app has exactly two files that do — `RecordScreen`
   * (web/components/record-chrome.tsx, the thirteen hand-composed screens) and
   * `renderDetail` (shared/web/screen-engine/screen-renderer.tsx, the five
   * recipe-driven ones, on BOTH front doors). A third would be caught by the
   * same census the day it is written, which is the entire point: the defect
   * this law closes is a class that was correct on the path it was written for
   * and invisible to the path that came after.
   *
   * SCOPED TO THE THREE APP ROOTS. `tools/screen-builder/samples/` also renders
   * `<RecordDetail>` and is deliberately outside: it is the kit's own component
   * gallery, whose job is to draw each vendored export RAW with dummy content.
   * A record title there is not a record title, it is a specimen — so it is out
   * by scope rather than by an exemption entry that would have to be maintained.
   *
   * COMMENTS STRIPPED FIRST (CONVENTIONS.md). record-chrome.tsx now carries a
   * long comment naming `RECORD_TITLE_TREATMENT` where the constant used to be
   * defined, and record-heading-clamps.test.tsx mentions `<RecordChrome>` in
   * prose — on raw text the first would keep this check green after the
   * className was deleted, and the second would report a test file as an
   * unwired detail screen. */
