// THE FIELD THAT WAS ONLY EVER ON THE MACHINE SURFACE.
//
// `createTicket` has accepted a staff-named client since the customer spine
// landed, and workers/content/test/help-fence.test.ts proves the door means it:
// "a ticket the AGENCY raises for a client reaches that client's people". The MCP
// tool exposed it too, with its own note that without `accountId` "a machine can
// only raise tickets that no client will ever see".
//
// The screen never asked. So every ticket a person typed in the agency app
// belonged to nobody and appeared in no client's portal — with a green build the
// whole time, because no check has ever asked whether a form offers what its door
// accepts. This is that question, for this door.
//
// It drives the real dialog rather than scanning its source: a picker that renders
// and a value that reaches `onSubmit` are two different claims, and the second is
// the one the bug was about.
//
// WHERE "THE LIVE COMPANIES ONLY" IS NOW PROVED, and why it moved. This used to
// assert that a retired account and a person were absent from the rendered option
// rows — which was true of the options the browser had, and the browser had page
// one. Accounts PAGE (R14), so that assertion was about the newest fifty and
// silent about the rest, which is exactly the bug the owner then reported from a
// phone. The narrowing now rides the request, so the claim is asserted on the
// REQUEST: the door is asked for entities that are not archived, and the door
// answers for the whole collection.
