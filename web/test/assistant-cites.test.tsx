// AN ANSWER THAT QUOTES ITS SOURCES, AS PAINTED (Law R23, ruling D7-2).
//
// The whole feature is a chain with four links and every one of them is quiet
// when it breaks: the model writes a mark, the renderer turns it into the kit's
// `<Cite>`, the kit numbers it against the turn's own sources, and the pill
// underneath says which source that number is. A break anywhere renders PROSE —
// a perfectly readable answer with no provenance, which is exactly the failure
// the law exists to prevent and exactly the failure nobody notices.
//
// So this reads the DOM the person looks at, through the real kit component,
// with the real renderer. Four things it proves and each one has been a real bug
// in this class somewhere:
//
//   1. the mark is drawn, numbered by POSITION, inside the sentence it belongs
//      to — not on its own line, which is what splitting the rendered HTML would
//      have produced;
//   2. the raw `[[src:…]]` never reaches the screen;
//   3. a mark naming a source this turn does NOT carry draws nothing at all,
//      so a model reaching back to an earlier question's passages cannot leave a
//      superscript pointing at a pill that is not there;
//   4. the pill says BOTH halves of the ruled shape, `collection · record`.
