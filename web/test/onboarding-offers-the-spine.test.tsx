// THE SPINE IS OFFERED DURING ONBOARDING, AND SKIPPING IT WRITES NOTHING.
//
// Client ruling, 2026-09-02, verbatim: "default spine to mango, but everyone
// can change it during the onboarding or anytime at settings". Two halves, and
// this suite locks the half a screen can get wrong in silence.
//
// MANGO RETIRED, 22 SEP 2026 — "reduce backgorund options to only balck or
// paper (rmoeve mango)". `DEFAULT_SPINE` moved to `paper` the same day
// (shared/spine.ts's own header has the full reasoning); this suite now
// asserts the CURRENT fallback rather than the 2026-09-02 one, and adds a
// case for a row still holding the retired `mango` value, the same shape it
// already held for the retired `quiet` value below.
//
// WHAT IS ACTUALLY AT RISK HERE, and why it is a suite rather than a glance:
//
// 1. THE DEFAULT ITSELF. `DEFAULT_SPINE` was paper before the 2026-09-02
//    ruling, on a written argument that a person who never opened Settings
//    should keep the rail they always had; that ruling overruled it in favour
//    of mango, and the 22 Sep 2026 mango retirement moved the fallback back to
//    paper as a MECHANICAL consequence (mango is not a `Spine` any more), not
//    a re-litigation of the argument (shared/spine.ts keeps both in full). A
//    value that has moved twice is the kind that gets moved back by a merge.
//
// 2. TAKING THE DEFAULT MUST WRITE NOTHING. `users.spine` NULL means "never
//    chosen" and is kept distinct from a deliberate choice, exactly as `scale`
//    and `language` are. A screen that posted the value it happened to be
//    showing would destroy that distinction for every person who ever onboards
//    — and it would do it invisibly, because the rail would look identical.
//
// 3. THE CHOICE RIDES THE ONE SUBMIT, AND GOES FIRST. Settings saves on press
//    because it can revert a failure into a screen the person is still standing
//    on; onboarding has no such screen, and the two calls after it are the
//    expensive ones (`updateProfile` mints a new R2 key for the photo every
//    run, `bootstrap` ACCEPTS pending invites). So the cheap reversible call
//    goes first and a refusal costs one retry with nothing left behind. Order
//    is a property no type can hold, which is why it is asserted here.
//
// Driven through the real component and the real submit, like its sibling
// `onboarding-dead-ends.test.tsx`: the risk is in what this page DOES with an
// ordinary answer, never in a helper.
