// THE BUG THE OWNER REPORTED, as a test.
//
//   "whenever I go into the details screen of any record and it has multiple
//    tabs, especially when it comes to sprints or activity or apps, I'm noticing
//    that only when I click on those tabs does the badge count appear. … until I
//    don't click on the tab, I am always assuming that there is no information in
//    that tab because there's no badge count."
//
// The mechanism was exact. A tab badge read a sidecar cache key
// (`total:<prefix>:<recordId>`) through `useCachedValue`, which is a pure cache
// READ and never fetches; the only thing that ever wrote that key was the tab
// PANEL's own list fetch. So the number arrived when the panel mounted and not
// one moment sooner — and because `formatCount` renders nothing for a zero AND
// nothing for a missing number, "nobody has looked yet" and "there are none of
// these" were the same pixels.
//
// So the assertion that matters is NOT "the door returns numbers". It is: with
// NO panel mounted and NO tab touched, the badge is there. Every test below is
// a version of that sentence, plus the two things that would quietly undo it —
// a count that never refreshes (worse than a blank one, because it looks right)
// and a denied module answering "0" instead of "we did not look".
