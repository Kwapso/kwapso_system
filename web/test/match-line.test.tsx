// "1 TICKETS MATCH" — the sentence under every search box in the app.
//
// The find bar built its own line out of a number, a noun and the word "match":
// `` `${total} ${noun} match` ``. Correct exactly once — when the total was not
// one — and wrong on the reading a person is most likely to be looking at, on
// six screens, since the bar was written.
//
// The fix is not an `s`, and this file is here to keep it from becoming one. A
// sentence assembled at run time out of three pieces is a sentence no catalogue
// can hold (R28): the key IS the English, so a glued line has no key, and the
// six nouns rode in as bare props that no extractor ever saw — the whole line
// reached a German reader in English, plural bug and all. Whole sentences are
// the unit a translator can be handed, so the screen owns the words and this
// seam owns only the choice between them and the number that goes in the hole.
//
// DRIVEN RATHER THAN SCANNED. The defect was three characters of template
// literal that read perfectly well; what was wrong was what appeared on screen
// for one particular total, and nothing but rendering it at that total says so.
