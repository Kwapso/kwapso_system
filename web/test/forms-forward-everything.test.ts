// A HANDLER THAT REBUILDS A FORM'S PAYLOAD WILL EVENTUALLY DROP A FIELD.
//
// THE OWNER, 26 Aug 2026: "there are some fields in many screens that don't get
// saved in the edit screen. One example… the ticket modules are not getting
// saved."
//
// The ticket form offered a Module picker; the door was ready to write it; and
// the ticket detail's own submit handler rebuilt the payload field by field and
// left `moduleId` out. Nothing errored, the toast said "Ticket updated", and the
// value came back unchanged. The SAME edit saved correctly from the tickets
// list, because that screen forwards its argument whole.
//
// TypeScript cannot see this: a handler taking FEWER properties is assignable to
// one that supplies more, so narrowing the parameter HIDES the omission rather
// than reporting it. That is what makes it worth a check of its own.
//
// The rule: a form-dialog submit handler forwards what it was given — a spread,
// or the argument itself — rather than transcribing it.
