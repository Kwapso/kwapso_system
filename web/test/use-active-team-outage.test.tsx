// AN OUTAGE IS NOT A SIGN-OUT.
//
// Earned on 2026-08-14. The owner rotated the Cloudflare API token; that token
// is the CF_D1_TOKEN secret on eight worker deployments, so every read over the
// D1 REST door started failing. Sign-in itself stayed healthy — the auth worker
// reaches the core database through its own native binding and never touches
// that token — so the shape of the failure was this:
//
//   sign in  ->  succeeds  ->  /home  ->  GET /api/tenancy/active 500s
//            ->  session cleared, bounced to /login  ->  sign in again  ->  loop
//
// Three people were locked out of a working application for forty minutes, and
// because one of them was mid-form when the token died, it read as "submitting
// the form logged me out". Nothing was wrong with any of their accounts.
//
// The defect was one bare `catch` in use-active-team.ts that could not tell a
// 401 from a 500 and treated both as "you are signed out". The distinction is
// the whole fix, and it is what this file pins:
//
//   401           -> really signed out -> clear the session, go to /login
//   500/503/other -> the app is unwell -> keep the session, stay put
//
// The second line is the one that matters. Sending a signed-in person to a
// sign-in door that works cannot fix a data door that doesn't; it just hides an
// outage behind what looks like an account problem, which is the most expensive
// way to be wrong about a five-minute fix.

 *
 * AND IT MUST HAND BACK `ApiFailure` FROM THE SAME GRAPH. `resetModules` gives
 * the hook a fresh copy of every module it imports, including the one that
 * declares ApiFailure — so a class imported at the top of this file is a
 * DIFFERENT class object from the one the hook is testing `instanceof` against,
 * and every `instanceof` inside the hook quietly returns false. That is not a
 * curiosity: it made three of these four tests pass for the wrong reason on the
 * first run. They asserted "does not redirect", and the hook was not redirecting
 * because its type check was failing, not because it had recognised a server
 * error. The one test that could not be faked this way — the 401 that MUST
 * redirect — is what exposed it. Same graph, or these tests measure nothing. */
