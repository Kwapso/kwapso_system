// What the shell shows when a person stops belonging anywhere.
//
// Being removed from your last team clears the shared session cache and bounces
// you to /onboarding. That bounce is a CLIENT navigation, so there is a window
// where the shell is still mounted with no person and no team behind it. It used
// to keep `loading` false through that window and paint a hollow shell — an
// empty nav and a profile button with no identity — which is what "the profile
// button seems broken" turned out to be. The rule locked here: no session means
// loading, exactly as it does on the very first render.
//
// The order matters and is the whole point. A cold render was ALREADY loading,
// so it proves nothing; the regression only shows itself once a session has been
// cached and painted, and a background revalidate then takes it away. This test
// paints first, then removes.
