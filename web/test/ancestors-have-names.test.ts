// A RECORD YOU CAME IN THROUGH IS STILL ON SCREEN, AND IT HAS A NAME.
//
// THE OWNER, 24 Aug 2026, twice.
//
// First on `/accounts/01KZ…/sprints/01KZ…`: the breadcrumb read "Account ›
// Sprints › CONFIA-SPR0020" while the screen underneath displayed "CLIENT:
// Confia". Then, after that was fixed, on
// `/accounts/…/apps/…/processes/…`:
//
//   "does it not make sense that all of the breadcrumbs should hold the name of
//    the record of the detail screen which was open, rather than the name of the
//    module?"
//
// TWO CAUSES, one shape. A crumb's name was looked up inside whichever list
// happened to be in cache, so it was there when the collection was small and
// gone when it was not. `processes` had no entry at all, so the deepest crumb
// simply vanished; `accounts` had one, but the list is paged at fifty and Confia
// was row 118 of 131, so the lookup found nothing and the crumb said the generic
// word. Neither errored. Both just said less than they knew.
//
// WHY THE OLD VERSION OF THIS FILE MISSED THE SECOND ONE, which is the lesson
// worth keeping: it enumerated the modules to check BY READING `recordLabel` —
// the very function that was incomplete. A module absent from the labeller was
// therefore absent from the census, so the check could only ever confirm that
// what was already handled was handled. It is R21's substitution again:
// ENUMERATE BY WHAT A URL CAN CARRY, never by what the code that handles URLs
// happens to name.
//
// So the census now starts from the SECTION TABLE — every URL segment the app
// can put a record id after — and demands each one has a face. And a face must
// carry a by-id read, because a paged list is not a place a name can be relied
// on to live.
