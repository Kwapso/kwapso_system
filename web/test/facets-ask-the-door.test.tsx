// THE CLIENT HALF OF A FILTER THAT PAGES.
//
// `workers/content/test/paged-facets.test.ts` proves the DOOR narrows the whole
// collection — a row that is not on page one is found by the facet. This proves
// the four things the SCREEN has to get right for that to reach anybody, and each
// is a way to have a working door and a lying list:
//
//   1. THE FACETS CARRY THE DOOR'S NAMES AND THE DOOR'S VALUES. `kind=meeting`,
//      never `kind=From a meeting`, and never the shaped row's column.
//   2. PICKING ONE ASKS THE DOOR, from page one, in a cache key of its own —
//      so nothing has to remember to reset, and the collection's own rows and
//      cursor are untouched underneath.
//   3. TWO FILTERS ARE ONE QUESTION, one key, one request.
//   4. AN UNTOUCHED SCREEN ASKS NOTHING, and looks exactly as it did before any
//      of this existed.
//
// EVERY ASSERTION HERE IS ABOUT WHAT THE DOOR WAS ASKED after a person operates
// the real control, and that is deliberate. The lane that shipped sorting the day
// before wrote checks that asked whether the pieces were present and consistent —
// the screen's option names against the door's menu, the recipe's control, the
// comparator's output — and every one of them passed while the column headers
// reordered nothing at all. None of them asked whether anything moves when
// somebody presses the thing. This file asks nothing else.
//
// THE CONTROL IS THE DESIGN KIT'S NOW (2026-08-27), and this file has changed
// with it in exactly one place both times: `pick` below. It used to drive two
// different code paths — past eight options the old row drew a cmdk popover,
// under it a Radix Select, so one facet opened on a click and the other on a
// pointerdown. The kit's own `SearchableFacet` replaced both with one
// always-expanded list. Then the client ruled that list out (2026-09-02: her
// artifact draws one short field reading "Any client", not a search box over
// every client), so a facet is the kit's `Select` inside the same panel, and
// `pick` opens two things instead of one. What is asserted underneath has not
// moved a line: operate the real control, read what the door was asked.

 *
 * THE FACET'S OWN FIELD OPENS SECOND. It used to be the kit's `Select`,
 * whose trigger listens for `pointerdown` and claims `role="combobox"`, so a
 * bare `click` opened nothing. `CompactFacet` (v1.2.27, the compact-field
 * ruling — see the header) is a plain disclosure button over a Radix
 * `Popover` instead (`CompactFacet`'s own doc: "NOT A COMBOBOX,
 * deliberately"), and `Popover`'s own trigger opens on an ordinary `click`
 * (`@radix-ui/react-popover`'s own `onClick`) — so this now finds a plain
