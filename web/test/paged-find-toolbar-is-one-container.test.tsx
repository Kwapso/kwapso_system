// PAGEDFIND'S OWN TRACK GETS THE SAME "ONE CONTAINER" FIX `ToolbarRow` DOES.
//
// CLIENT RULING, 2026-09-03, verbatim: "what this is doing is creating a new
// card underneath... it kind of creates a second toolbar. This is not the
// behaviour I want. I want it to look together, so merge this with the main
// toolbar so that it's one single background or container, more like expand
// behaviour rather than open-a-new-one behaviour."
//
// `web/test/filter-row-is-the-kits.test.tsx` already locks this property for
// `ToolbarRow` (screen-bits.tsx). `PagedFind` (this file's own subject) draws
// the IDENTICAL track by hand — its own header comment says so verbatim,
// "same treatment as `ToolbarRow`" — and until this pass it had NOT received
// the fix: the track kept `rounded-pill bg-background` unconditionally, and
// the open panel sat one `gap-2` below it as a second sibling, which is
// exactly the two-same-toned-boxes-with-air-between-them shape the ruling
// above is naming. Since `paged-find.tsx` backs Tickets, Stories, Processes,
// Meetings, Contacts and more, that was the regression showing on every one
// of them, not merely a cosmetic gap in one screen.
//
// This proves the same three properties `filter-row-is-the-kits.test.tsx`
// proves for `ToolbarRow`, against `PagedFind`'s own DOM: the track never
// moves when the panel opens, the panel is a normal-flow sibling that paints
// no surface of its own, and the single merged container is the only element
// that switches radius, off `Boolean` of the panel and never off a measured
// height.

/** THE TRACK'S SHAPE, with the one attribute that is SUPPOSED to change
 * normalised away.
 *
 * This assertion exists for the client's "one container" ruling: opening the
 * filter panel must not make the pill move, resize or repaint. `outerHTML`
 * was a fair proxy for that — until the add-filter button gained
 * `aria-expanded` (kit v1.2.42), which flips false→true precisely BECAUSE the
 * panel opened. That is a state announcement for a screen reader, not a
 * visual change: a person watching the pill sees nothing move, and a person
 * listening finally hears that the control expands something.
 *
 * So the comparison drops `aria-expanded` and keeps everything else byte for
 * byte — a class, a style, a structural change or a second attribute flipping
 * still fails it. Normalising the whole attribute (rather than asserting one
 * expected value) is deliberate: the point here is that the track did not
 * move, and the aria state has its own test elsewhere. */
