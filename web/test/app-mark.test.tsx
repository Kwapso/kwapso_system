// AN APP'S SQUARE DEGRADES TO THE MARK, NEVER TO A BROKEN-IMAGE GLYPH.
//
// The apps screen is a wall of tiles because an app is the one record a person
// recognises by sight, so the square is the whole screen's subject. Which makes
// the failure case worth a test rather than a shrug: `logoUrl` being SET is not
// the same fact as the bytes still being there, and the difference between the
// two on screen is a grid of grey torn-paper icons.
//
// It will happen. A stored path survives its object (nothing reclaims an app's
// old logo yet), the column also accepts a URL somebody pastes by hand, and the
// migration that filled it (`scripts/glide-visuals.mjs`) carries pictures from an
// account that is being cancelled. `null` is the easy half and a null check
// catches it; a 404 is the half that needs `onError`.
//
// The other claim here is the pair: the fallback is the SAME stage mark the tile
// drew before the column existed, so a logo that fails leaves the screen exactly
// as it was rather than blank.
