// CONTACTS ARE GROUPED UNDER THE COMPANY THEY SIT AT — and the grouping tells
// the truth about a list that pages.
//
// The owner asked for one thing ("grouped by company") and the risk in it is not
// the grouping, it is the PAGING: the accounts collection hands over fifty rows
// at a time, so a group drawn from what is loaded can be short. Three claims,
// and each is a way this could be quietly wrong:
//
//   1. a contact lands under HER OWN company, and the headings read in
//      alphabetical order — the arrangement somebody scans.
//   2. a company is ONE group no matter which page its contacts arrived on. The
//      map is built over every loaded row rather than per page, so pressing
//      "Load more" fills a group in; a per-page grouping would draw Bergman
//      twice, which is the failure that would look most like it worked.
//   3. THE SCREEN SAYS SO WHILE IT IS STILL SHORT, and stops saying it once the
//      cursor is spent. A caption that never appears is a lie; one that never
//      goes away is a different one.
//
// …plus the two groups that are not a company: a parent we are not holding (we
// can say she works somewhere, not where) and no parent at all.
