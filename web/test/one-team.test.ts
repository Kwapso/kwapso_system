 *    guard, so a plain `includes` is answered by the explanation. Deleting the
 *    `if (TEAM_SCREENS_HIDDEN)` early return from team-switcher.tsx, and the
 *    `{!TEAM_SCREENS_HIDDEN && (` wrapper from settings-screen.tsx, both left
 *    this green — the header comment naming the flag was doing the work.
 *  • IMPORTS. A flag that is merely IMPORTED is not a flag that GATES. The
 *    TEAM_CREATION_CLOSED pair has always caught that with its own `!FLAG`
 *    assertion; TEAM_SCREENS_HIDDEN had no such companion, and its two shapes
 *    (`if (FLAG)` and `{!FLAG && (`) are too different for one regex. Dropping
 *    the import is what makes a bare mention mean something.
