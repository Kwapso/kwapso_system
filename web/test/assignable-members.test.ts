// WHO THE AGENCY APP OFFERS WHEN IT ASKS "WHO?"
//
// A client-portal login is an ordinary team member, so every picker built from
// the members list was offering the agency's own clients: "Who's doing it" on a
// new task, the assignee on a story, an app's staff, triage duty, the people you
// can tag on a ticket. The owner opened one and read his clients' names back.
//
// Two halves, checked separately. The DOOR says which members are client logins
// (workers/tenancy/test/members-are-ours.test.ts). This is the other half: what
// the front door does with that, and — the part that actually holds over time —
// that there is only ONE place doing it.
//
// The behaviour test would pass with the rule copied into nine screens. The
// SOURCE test is the one that catches the tenth.
