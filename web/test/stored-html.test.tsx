// WHAT A STORED BODY CAN DO WHEN IT IS PUT ON A SCREEN.
//
// The long-text fields on both front doors are rich text now — a ticket
// description, a task's detail, a story, a meeting's agenda and notes, a
// process and its steps, an app's about/context/solution, a sprint goal, a
// to-do, an article. Which means a body typed by ONE person is injected into
// ANOTHER person's page, and across the account fence in both directions: a
// client types a ticket in the portal and our staff read it in the agency app;
// we write a to-do and they read it in theirs.
//
// That is the stored-XSS shape, and this app has had one before. So the rule is
// not "we sanitise", it is "there is exactly ONE place that injects, and what it
// injects has been through the allow-list". Two tests, and they check different
// things on purpose:
//
//   1. THE CENSUS — every dangerouslySetInnerHTML on either front door is a
//      reviewed line with a reason. A second injection site cannot appear
//      without somebody writing down why, which is the failure this catches:
//      not a bad sanitizer, a screen that skipped it.
//   2. THE RENDER — the seam is actually rendered, with hostile bodies in it,
//      and the resulting DOM is inspected. sanitizeRichHtml's own unit tests
//      (rich-text.test.ts) assert about a STRING; this asserts about the page,
//      which is the thing a person is looking at.
//
// rich-text.test.ts covers the sanitizer and the URL boundary. This covers the
// screens.
