// THE LAW MACHINERY'S OWN GUARD.
//
// Every law in this repo is a source scan, and every source scan stands on two
// things: a walk that finds the files, and a stripper that removes the prose. Both
// used to exist in many copies.
//
// The walk: thirteen test files hand-rolled a recursive readdirSync, filtering
// differently. web/test/rules.test.ts enforced R3/R4/R7/R16 over a RECURSIVE walk
// of web/components (three subdirectories); web-portal/test/rules.test.ts enforced
// the same four laws over a FLAT read of web-portal/components. Both said "every
// component". The portal's folder is flat, so both were green — and the first
// portal component to move into a subdirectory would have left them green and
// wrong.
//
// The stripper: `stripComments` existed EIGHT times — three named copies (one of
// them guarding the mcp worker, the external machine surface) and five inline
// repetitions of the same two regexes. Harden one and the other seven are checks
// that only look like it.
//
// So this file guards the guard: the walker behaves as its options say, there is
// exactly ONE stripComments, and the one genuinely different stripper (JSONC, for
// JSON.parse) is proved to be a different job rather than a straggler.
