// THE CONFIRM PANEL, AS PAINTED. The yes/no panel is the last thing standing
// between a talked-into assistant and a real change, so this test reads the
// PIXELS' text — the actual DOM the admin looks at — not "the summary function
// was called". It drives the real chat state machine with a real `confirm` event
// off the wire, then renders the panel's own step list and reads it back.
//
// The gap this closes: the panel used to render the one-line summary alone, so
// "Set access rights for the Sub Admin role" asked for a yes to a payload nobody
// could see. A confirm you cannot read is not a confirm.
