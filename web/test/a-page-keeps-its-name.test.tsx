// A PAGE KEEPS ITS NAME, even when a counted tab strip takes its count.
//
// THE BUG, found by the owner on 30 Aug 2026. The Sprints screen had no title
// at all — the tab strip, then the rows, and nothing saying what page you were
// on. Accounts, Tickets, Tasks, Meetings and Apps were the same. Six of the
// app's fourteen screens were anonymous.
//
// HIS QUESTION WAS THE BETTER HALF: how did this get past rules this strict?
//
// It got past them because it OBEYED them. R16 says a collection shows its count
// exactly once, and `CollectionHeading` implemented the arbitration as
// `if (standsDown) return null` — which satisfies that sentence perfectly, and
// takes the title and the glyph with it. No law anywhere said a page must have a
// name, so nothing objected, and a screen losing its own name is invisible to a
// check that is counting counts.
//
// The distinction this file locks is small and exact: the BADGE stands down, the
// HEADING does not.
