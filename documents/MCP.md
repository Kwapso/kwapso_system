# MCP.md, the machine door (how outside tools use Kwapso)

Kwapso has an **external machine surface**: an AI agent, a script, or an automation
can do the same things a person can, invite/manage members, read and write tickets
and the work engine, run imports, pull CSV exports, even talk to the in-app assistant, over the
**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. This is the `mcp` worker (ARCHITECTURE → the MCP
front desk). This doc is for the **developer** who wants to connect a tool to it.

The one sentence to remember: **a machine acts AS a real person, in ONE team, capped
by that person's live role. Never more.** There is no separate "API key with god
powers." A token is just that person, reached by a machine.

---

## 1 · Who can use it

Anyone on **your team** who holds a role that allows the actions they want. There is no
separate developer sign-up, the machine borrows a human's rights.

**Your clients cannot.** A client-portal contact is an ordinary team member by
construction (grant → invite → accept is the only way to make a working portal login),
so "can they sign in?" was never the right question. See §5. They are refused at both
doors: they cannot make a token, and a token cannot act for one.

So to give a teammate/contractor machine access:

1. **Invite them to the team** (Settings → Members → Invite, or the app's invite flow).
   They sign in with **email + a 6-digit code** (no passwords). Hand them the app URL:
   - Staging: `https://agency-staging.kwapso.app`
   - Production: `https://agency.kwapso.app`
2. **Give them the right role.** The token can only do what their role allows (see the
   cost note in §4, a role *without* the AI-agent right can't spend any AI budget).
   For a pure "read + import + export" integration, a role with those rights and **no
   agent access** is the safe, zero-AI-cost choice.
3. They **make their own token** (next section). You never see or handle their secret.

Prefer a **dedicated service login** for an unattended integration: make one app
login (e.g. `ci@yourco.com`), invite it with a tightly-scoped role, and let it hold the
token, so a person leaving doesn't break the automation, and you can revoke it alone.

---

## 2 · Get a token (once, in the app)

1. Sign in → **Settings → Access tokens → New token**.
2. Give it a name (what will use it. "CI importer", "Zapier", "Claude Desktop").
3. Copy the secret **immediately**, it's shown **once** and never again (only its hash
   is stored). It looks like `kwapso_mcp_<64 hex chars>`.
4. The token is **pinned to the team you were in** when you made it, and **capped by
   your role at call time** (change the role later and the token's power changes with
   it). Revoke it any time from the same screen, revocation takes effect on the very
   next call.
5. **It expires after 90 days**, and you can hold **10 live tokens at once**. The
   screen shows each token's "works until" date; past it, calls come back
   `401 token_expired` and you make a new one (there is no renewal, a new secret is
   the point). Trying to mint an eleventh live token is a clean refusal: revoke one
   you no longer use first. Both limits exist for the same reason, a key with no end
   date is a key forever, and an unbounded pile of them is a pile you stop watching.

Treat the secret like a password. Anyone holding it can act as you, in that team.

---

## 3 · Connect a tool

The endpoint is **`POST https://<app-host>/mcp`** (JSON-RPC 2.0), authenticated with
`Authorization: Bearer <your token>`. It speaks standard MCP: `initialize`,
`tools/list`, `tools/call`.

**Quick check with curl:**

```bash
# List the tools this token can call
curl -s https://agency.kwapso.app/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer kwapso_mcp_XXXX" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'

# Call one — who am I, and which team is this token pinned to?
curl -s https://agency.kwapso.app/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer kwapso_mcp_XXXX" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"whoami","arguments":{}}}'
```

**An MCP client that speaks HTTP + a bearer header** (e.g. an agent framework, or a
custom client) points at that URL with the header. For clients that only launch a
local stdio command (e.g. **Claude Desktop**), put a thin MCP-over-HTTP bridge in
front with the standard `mcp-remote` shim, drop this into the client's MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kwapso": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://agency.kwapso.app/mcp",
        "--header", "Authorization: Bearer kwapso_mcp_YOUR_TOKEN"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Hand it to any AI (Claude / Gemini / GPT), copy-paste prompt

The app does this for you: after you create a token, **Settings → Access tokens** shows
a **"Copy setup prompt for any AI"** button (and an **Instructions** button on every
active token) that copies the block below with the live host filled in. Paste it into
any assistant that can speak MCP:

```
Connect to my Kwapso workspace over MCP (Model Context Protocol).

Endpoint: https://agency.kwapso.app/mcp
Auth header: Authorization: Bearer kwapso_mcp_YOUR_TOKEN
Protocol: MCP over HTTP — JSON-RPC 2.0 (initialize, tools/list, tools/call)

Then call tools/list to see what I can do. You act as me, in one team, capped by my
role — reads, exports and import writes are free; only the assistant tools
(agent_chat, agent_confirm, and plan_import — the import step that asks the
assistant to plan a batch), plus ask_knowledge when you set compose, use the team's
AI quota.
```

(Staging is the same, on `https://agency-staging.kwapso.app/mcp`.)

### The tools

Confirm the live list with `tools/list` (it's generated, so it's always current).
Today it covers:

- **Read** — 65 of the 190 tools (counted from the live catalogue, 26 Aug 2026),
  grouped the way the app groups them. A few families below keep their everyday
  writes named beside their reads, because that is how the app itself groups them;
  the write families proper are under **Write**:
  - **asking, rather than listing** — `describe_module` and `query_records`. One
    read tool over every module a caller may read: `describe_module` answers with
    the fields, their types and an enum's values (including the ones the team
    edits, read live off its own dropdown list), and `query_records` takes
    filters, an optional grouped count, an order and a cursor and answers through
    the same paged shape as every other list. It exists because the list tools
    enumerate a question's COMBINATIONS and still could not express a DATE RANGE
    or a GROUPED COUNT: "how many tickets did we resolve in July, per client" was
    a page-walk of 1,820 rows and is now one call. Same gate as the module's own
    list door, same rows, better question — and the door builds the SQL, so a
    caller composes a request and never a statement. Its ops are eq, ne, in,
    notIn, gt, gte, lt, lte, between, contains, isNull and notNull. The list
    tools below are unchanged and stay the shortest path to "give me this
    collection".
  - identity and rights, `whoami`, `my_permissions`, `get_team`
  - **what has changed, and who changed it** — `read_activity`, the cross-module
    history feed. It is the one door whose answer is assembled by SUBTRACTING
    the caller's denied modules (R18), so a team-scope read is the history for
    THAT caller and not for the team: the count moves with the role. It arrived
    on this surface on 1 Sep 2026 under R47, which asks that every module a
    person can see is one the assistant can answer about — and the reason this
    door had held out until then, written down at the time, was that the merged
    stream was "a separate decision for the owner, not a parity default". The
    owner made it. `scope` is team, record, user, role or invite; the record
    scope takes the record's own `table` and `id`.
  - people and access, `list_members`, `list_roles`, `list_invites`,
    `list_portal_access`
  - customers, `list_accounts`, `get_account`
  - vocabulary, `list_dropdown_values`
  - tickets, `list_help_tickets`, `get_help_thread`, `list_help_stakeholders`
  - the work engine, `list_stories`, `list_sprints`, `list_todos`, `list_tasks`,
    `get_triage`, `list_work_logs`, `list_running_timers`, `get_team_pulse`
  - meetings, `list_meetings`
  - the sections of an app, `list_app_modules`, `create_app_module`,
    `update_app_module`, `set_app_module_active`. A MODULE is what a ticket says
    it is about (Settings, Documents, Tasks), so it is how tickets are grouped —
    and it is not a process: a process is a way of working and belongs to the
    account's world, a module is a division of the software we built.
  - process maps and the money, `list_apps`, `list_processes`, `get_process`,
    `list_process_comments`, `read_impact`, `list_account_rates`,
    `list_story_attachments`, `add_story_link`, `update_story_attachment`,
    `remove_story_attachment`,
    `list_internal_rates`, `read_margin`, `list_role_rates`, `get_app_impact`
  - **the client's own organisation** — who does the work at a client, what an
    hour of them costs, and what they run on. `list_client_departments`,
    `create_client_department`, `update_client_department`,
    `set_client_department_active`; `list_client_roles`, `create_client_role`,
    `update_client_role`, `set_client_role_person`, `set_client_role_active`;
    `list_client_tools`, `list_client_tool_prices`, `create_client_tool`,
    `update_client_tool`, `set_client_tool_price`, `set_client_tool_active`.
    They are on this surface because a saving is only MONEY once a step's
    minutes meet a role's hourly cost — an assistant asked "what would
    automating this save Bergman" has to be able to read and fill these.
    Three things are worth knowing before you call them. A ROLE can sit in
    SEVERAL departments, and `departmentIds` on `update_client_role` is the
    WHOLE set rather than an addition — anything you leave out is removed. A
    PERSON on a role is a contact you already have, never a new record. And a
    TOOL's price is DATED: `set_client_tool_price` files an amount under the day
    it started being true, `list_client_tools` takes `asOf` to read the price in
    force on a given day, and `list_client_tool_prices` is the whole history —
    which is what lets a map set to March cost March correctly instead of
    rewriting it with today's number.
  - what we hand over on a system, `list_deliverables` (`appId` names the app
    whose handover shelf you want; `id` narrows to one row). The CLIENT's own
    view of the same shelf is a separate door on the portal and is deliberately
    NOT on this surface: it answers with strictly less (their account only, the
    rows marked visible only, no staff names), and this surface holds a staff
    token, so `list_deliverables` already gives a machine more
  - the knowledge base, `ask_knowledge`, `list_knowledge_sources`,
    `get_knowledge_status`
  - the agency's own housekeeping, `list_brand_assets`, `list_meeting_purposes`,
    `list_staff_profiles`, `list_staff_certificates`
  - importing, `list_import_targets`, `get_import_sample`, `list_imports`,
    `get_import`
  - the AI allowance and saved conversations, `get_ai_allowance`, `list_ai_usage`,
    `list_agent_threads`, `get_agent_thread`
  - the six CSV exports, listed under **Export** below.

  Each list tool that sits on a door with an
  `?id=` filter EXPOSES + FORWARDS it (R19 parity). Pass `id` to fetch one record
  instead of pulling the whole collection (`list_help_tickets` also takes `scope`,
  `view`, the everyday list or the archive drawer, and `q`; `list_accounts` takes
  `q`, `type`, `archived` and `parentId`, plus `sort`, `dir` and the paging
  `cursor`; `list_stories` takes `q` beside its five). On every paged list the `total` counts the SAME filtered question the
  rows answer, so a narrowed call answers "how many are there?" in one round trip.

  **`my_permissions` is the one to call first.** `whoami` says who the token is and
  which team it is pinned to; `my_permissions` says what that person may DO there,
  module by module. Every door re-checks the same rights on every call regardless,
  this is simply how a client can know before it asks, instead of learning from a 403.

  **R19 now starts at the DOORS, and at ALL of them.** The parity check used to walk
  the tool catalogue, so a door with no tool wasn't a failure, it was invisible, which
  is how the whole customer spine sat off this surface with a green build. Moving the
  scan to the doors fixed that for doors that take a QUERY PARAMETER, and left every
  parameterless door just as invisible, which is where twenty capabilities were sitting
  (what may I do here, how much of the app's own daily AI allowance is left, what may I
  import into, what did that import plan say).

  So the census is now every non-admin door on tenancy, content, data-ops and auth,
  filtered or not, GET or POST. Each one has a tool on some machine surface or is a
  named, reasoned line in the check's `TOOLLESS_DOORS`, and a door that is neither is a
  red build. Today: **272 doors, 217 with a tool, 55 with a written reason**, the
  reasons being the team-pin doors (item 2 of the reasoned exclusions below), the
  client-portal standing doors (item 3), the sign-in and personal-identity doors on auth, the screen-recipe store,
  the THREE upload pairs, two media doors and the knowledge base, each a
  buffered door plus a streamed twin: the buffered half cannot be called because a
  base64 document will not fit in a tool argument, and the streamed half cannot be
  called because a JSON-RPC request has no body to stream into. Same conclusion,
  two different reasons, both written down, plus the ONE streamed door with no
  buffered twin (the bytes behind a deliverable, written after that pair stopped
  being worth shipping) which is the second of those two reasons on its own, the nine
  Google doors that are a person's own decision (three consent steps, four
  sharing decisions, the door that says how much of a mailbox or a calendar
  kwapso may read at all, and a Drive thumbnail that answers with an image), the timesheet correction, the two doors
  that spend the team's AI allowance outside a chat turn (translating a ticket's
  title, and translating a screen's human-typed text for the reader looking at
  it), one
  invite's audit trail, the cross-module activity feed, and the two
  record-counts doors, one per worker, which bundle a record's child totals so a
  SCREEN can badge its tabs in one round trip: every number in that bundle is
  already machine-readable, exactly and with narrowing those doors do not take,
  through `list_apps`, `list_processes`, `list_sprints`, `list_stories`,
  `list_todos`, `list_help_tickets` and `list_meetings`. Of the 217, **193 are on THIS surface** and 24 are the in-app assistant's
  alone: the twenty-one Google doors (the twenty `google_` tools plus the
  connections list), the two confirm-panel bulk writes and the role
  permission matrix read, each reasoned in §3.

  **Eight doors left the census on 18 August 2026**, and they are worth naming
  because they went for a product reason rather than a tidying one: the seven
  that WROTE to Google Calendar (create an event, change what it says and when,
  its guests, its location, call it off, push a sprint's dates, push a meeting's)
  and `POST /api/content/meetings/held`. The calendar is one-way now — kwapso
  reads a calendar and never writes one — and a meeting's own start time says
  whether it has happened, so a status somebody had to tick was a second source
  of truth for a question the clock answers. Those three numbers are asserted
  against the live census in `workers/mcp/test/filter-parity.test.ts`, so this
  sentence cannot quietly go stale again, it did, at 87 / 66 / 21, while the app
  grew to two and a half times the size.

  **One asymmetry worth stating plainly.** The in-app assistant now stops for a yes/no
  panel before every write that decides who-can-do-what, derived from the gate map,
  so anything gated on `member_roles:` or `team_members:` is included (EDGE-CASES §5). The MCP
  surface has **no such panel and cannot have one**: the confirming UI belongs to your
  client, not to Kwapso. That is not a capability gap, the same door, the same gate, the
  same audit row, but it means the operator of an MCP client is the one deciding when to
  confirm. Since 26 Aug 2026 the pause travels as words: every tool the app would
  stop for says so in its own description — "Destructive or access-widening: confirm
  with a person before calling this." — so a well-behaved client has the signal even
  though the panel is yours. If your client drives an LLM that reads team data
  (tickets, articles), treat those tools the way Kwapso does and put a human in
  front of them.

  **`list_help_tickets` is PAGED** (R14, tickets are a growing collection). One call
  returns one page plus `total` (the exact server count, not the page length),
  `hasMore`, and an opaque `nextCursor`. To read further, call again passing that
  value as `cursor`; never construct or mutate one, a cursor the server didn't issue
  is refused with a 400. When `hasMore` is false you have reached the end. A client
  that ignores the cursor still works: it simply sees the newest page.
  **A result is whole, or it is an error.** One `tools/call` answer is capped at
  400,000 characters. Over that the call comes back `isError: true` with a
  `result_too_large` body telling you to filter, page, or use the export tool, it is
  never sliced and handed back as a success. (It used to be: half a JSON document,
  reported `ok`, which a client has no way to notice and no reason to re-ask.)

  **An argument of the wrong type is refused, not coerced.** The type each tool
  declares in its `inputSchema` is the type enforced, checked before the call is built:
  `{"name": {}}` comes back a clean `invalid_input` naming the field. It used to be
  coerced with `String(v)` and arrive at the door as the perfectly valid 17-character
  string `"[object Object]"`, a browser form cannot produce that, and a JSON-RPC
  client can send anything.

  **A call has a deadline.** A tool that doesn't answer within 30 seconds (2 minutes
  for `run_import`, `plan_import`, `agent_chat` and `agent_confirm`, which are supposed
  to take a while) comes back `door_timeout` rather than holding your call open with
  nothing to read. A timeout is not a rollback: read before retrying a write.
- **File uploads are not on this surface, three doors, one reason.**
  `/api/content/knowledge/upload`, `/api/content/brand-assets/upload` and
  `/api/content/staff/upload` each take up to 25 MB of base64 data URL, on a
  surface whose whole ANSWER is capped at 400,000 characters. The RECORD half of
  each is fully machine-writable, `add_knowledge_source`, `create_brand_asset`,
  `save_staff_profile` and `create_staff_certificate` all carry the URL field, so a
  machine writes the row and references a file it already has a URL for. Uploading the bytes is a screen
  action.
- **Export (full-field CSV):** `export_roles_csv`, `export_dropdown_values_csv`,
  `export_accounts_csv`, `export_brand_assets_csv`, `export_meeting_purposes_csv`,
  `export_certificates_csv`.

  **Staff PROFILES have no export, on purpose.** A credential register is the kind
  of thing somebody hands an auditor; a one-click spreadsheet of what each of your
  colleagues is bad at is not a capability anybody asked for, and the write door
  that fills those fields is confirm-gated for the same reason.

  **An export is ONE WHOLE DOCUMENT. Never a page, and never a short file.** That is
  the deliberate answer to "why doesn't an export take a cursor?", and it is R14's own
  answer: all but one of these sit on **bounded** collections (a team's roles, its
  dropdown vocabulary, its meeting purposes, its brand assets and its staff
  certificates are all curated by hand and stop growing), and the law says in as
  many words that a bounded collection doesn't need a cursor to be
  honest. **Accounts is the one that grows**, every company and every person an agency
  works with, so `export_accounts_csv` narrows by the same four filters as
  `list_accounts` (`q`, `type`, `archived`, `parentId`), and past what one
  file can carry the door
  answers `export_too_large` rather than handing back the first rows as though they
  were all of them. The browser's Export CSV button gets exactly the same sentence from
  exactly the same door: a truncated export re-imported is data loss that looks like a
  round trip, and the columns lead with the import format precisely so it can be
  re-imported.
- **Write, deterministic create / edit / deactivate** (free, no AI; each needs the
  matching role right, e.g. `member_roles:create`):
  - **`set_record_active`, the generic form.** Every `set_<record>_active` tool below
    (roles, accounts, dropdown values, process maps, and the rest — twenty-one in
    all) is also reachable through this one tool: `record` names which kind
    (`account`, `role`, `dropdown_value`, …), `id` is that record's id (a role takes
    `roleId`, a deliverable also needs `appId`), `active` says which way. Both forms
    stay published side by side — the named ones are the pinned external contract
    (added first, and a script calling `set_account_active` keeps working forever),
    the generic one is for an integration that would rather send one shape for
    every record kind than remember twenty-one names. Same map, same doors, same
    confirm rule, either way.
  - the team, `update_team` (rename the team this token is pinned to; needs `teams:edit`)
  - roles, `create_role`, `update_role`, `set_role_active`, `set_role_permissions`
  - members, `set_member_role`, `remove_member` (people join via **invite**)
  - invites, `create_invite`, `revoke_invite`
  - accounts, `create_account`, `update_account`, `set_account_parent`,
    `set_account_active`, `link_contact`, `set_contact_link_active`
  - portal access, `grant_portal_access`, `set_portal_access_active`
  - dropdown values, `create_dropdown_value`, `update_dropdown_value`, `set_dropdown_value_default`, `set_dropdown_value_active`. A value marked as one of the team's defaults refuses to switch off — `set_dropdown_value_default` is how the mark comes off, and renaming a default is always allowed
  - process maps, `create_app`, `update_app`, `set_app_active`, `create_process`,
    `update_process`, `set_process_active`, `add_process_step`, `update_process_step`,
    `remove_process_step`, `delete_process_step`, `cut_process_version`, `comment_on_process`,
    `set_audit_date`, `connect_processes`, `disconnect_processes` (all need
    `processes:*`).
  - waves, `list_waves`, `get_wave`, `create_wave`, `update_wave`,
    `set_wave_active`, `set_sprint_wave` (all need `work:*`). A WAVE is what a
    client bought: several sprints sold together. It carries NO price — what a
    wave costs is deliberately out of this module's first version — and its dates
    are DERIVED from the sprints inside it, so `set_sprint_wave` re-dates both the
    wave a sprint joined and the one it left. Two sprints whose dates overlap are
    reported and never refused: the overlap is real, and a door that said no would
    be enforcing a rule nobody agreed to. `set_audit_date` moves the day a map's savings are measured
    FROM, which changes every figure on it and on the client's own portal while
    changing not one minute of their work — so it confirms before it writes.
    `connect_processes` is LOOSE by ruling: the last step of one map is very
    often the first step of another, and saying so alters no duration and no
    saving on either side. `read_impact` beside them is the savings drilled App → Process →
    Step, with the caption that says what the numbers are made of — the times are
    estimates the agency and the client agreed, the subtraction is arithmetic. A step
    that got SLOWER is included and counted; nothing filters one out.
  - rates and margin, `create_account_rate`, `update_account_rate`,
    `set_account_rate_active` (what a client is charged) and `create_internal_rate`,
    `update_internal_rate`, `set_internal_rate_active` (what our own hour costs us) and
    `set_role_rate` (what an hour of a ROLE is worth — one tool for add, re-price and
    retire, because the role name is the key), all needing `commercials:*`.
    **`read_margin`, `list_internal_rates`, `list_role_rates` and `get_app_impact` answer with
    the agency's own figures**: a token acts as its owner, and no client login can hold
    a token or be acted for at all, but if you are building a client-facing integration
    on somebody's staff token, these two are the calls not to relay. Law **R24** makes
    the same statement about the app's own client portal structurally — the file those
    figures live in cannot be reached from any door the portal opens. (R24, not R23 —
    R23 is the knowledge base's citation law.)
  - tickets, `create_help_ticket`, `update_help_ticket`, `set_help_status`,
    `validate_help_ticket`, `triage_help_ticket`, `resolve_help_ticket`,
    `rank_help_ticket`, `archive_help_ticket`, `reply_help_ticket`,
    `add_help_stakeholder`, plus the three that carry the files and links on a
    ticket: `list_help_attachments`, `add_help_link` and
    `remove_help_attachment`. (The module is Tickets; the tool NAMES carry the old
    `help` spelling because they are a published contract outside developers
    already call by name, so the rename of the section a person reads
    deliberately stopped at them — DATA-MODEL.md says why it never moves.)
    `rank_help_ticket` is how priority is expressed — the list's ORDER is the
    priority, and there is no priority field to set. `archive_help_ticket` puts a
    ticket away without deleting anything; read them back with
    `list_help_tickets` and `view: 'archived'`.

    **A STATUS IS A FACT HERE, NOT A SWITCH** (17 Aug 2026). Five of the seven
    stages are now reached by something HAPPENING rather than by anybody choosing
    them: `scheduled` when the work on a request lands in a sprint, `in_progress`
    when a timer starts on the ticket or on one of its stories, `ready` when the
    last story closes, `resolved` only through `resolve_help_ticket`, and
    `awaiting_validation` at birth for the kinds that wait. So `set_help_status`
    is a CORRECTION rather than the ordinary path, and it **will not accept
    `resolved`** — nor will either bulk — because answering a client means sending
    words, and a value in a dropdown carries none. The two stages a person still
    decides have doors of their own: `validate_help_ticket` (the client confirms
    an extra, a request or a piece of feedback — a question or an issue never
    waits) and `triage_help_ticket` (somebody has read it). Both are idempotent by
    construction: a second call moves nothing.
  - the work engine, stories and sprints, `create_story`, `update_story`,
    `set_story_status` (`work:create` / `work:edit`), `create_sprint`,
    `update_sprint` and `complete_sprint`. `update_sprint` is where a sprint's flat
    PRICE is set or corrected — it is the revenue half of every margin, and until
    that door existed it could be typed only in the moment the sprint was started.
    It will not move a sprint to another client or another app: the reference the
    client quotes was minted against the account, and the maps and figures
    published against the app were built where it stood, so re-pointing either
    would rewrite what an already-published figure means. (A process version is
    cut BY HAND, one door, one caller — the owner's 24 Aug 2026 ruling; migration
    `0051` purged the never-wired automatic cut on sprint completion.)
    A story has no priority field and no order to set: it sits in the sprint it
    was sold inside, and that is what says when it is due. (Ranking one used to be
    possible and was retired on 17 Aug 2026 — the owner's ruling, and the door
    went with the tool.) No client login holds `work:*` and the doors refuse a
    portal caller outright, so unlike the ticket doors the question "what if a
    contact reaches this?" has a one-word answer.
  - to-dos and tasks, `raise_todo`, `complete_todo`, `cancel_todo`
    (`todos:create` / `:edit` / `:delete` — what we need FROM a client), and
    `create_task`, `update_task`, `set_task_done` (`work:create` / `work:edit` —
    what we owe ourselves; `update_task` is also how a task is RE-PRIORITISED, since
    the 1-to-4 score is derived from its `important` and `urgent` ticks).
  - time, `start_timer`, `stop_timer`, `log_time`, `resolve_runaway_timer`,
    `set_timer_auto_stop`, all on `work:create`. Logging your OWN hours is a create,
    not an edit: a person who may do the work may say how long it took them.
    CORRECTING a row that already exists is `work:edit` and has deliberately no tool
    at all — see the exclusions below.
  - the triage rota, `set_triage_duty` (`help:edit`), beside the `get_triage` read.
  - meetings, `create_meeting`, `update_meeting`, `set_meeting_active`
    (`meetings:create` / `:edit` / `:delete`; cancelling IS this module's delete
    and the row survives it). There is no `set_meeting_held` and no
    `add_meeting_to_calendar`: a meeting's own start time says whether it has
    happened, and nothing in this product writes to a calendar.
    `read_meeting_transcript` opens on `meetings:edit`, demands `google:read` at
    the door, and one call writes a row of time for each
    of OUR OWN people who was in the room — never the client's, because a client's
    hour is not our cost. It is idempotent, so a second read does nothing: the
    claim rides `transcript_captured_at IS NULL`, which is a fact about the JOB
    rather than about the meeting, so nobody's hours can be doubled.
    The hunt itself is three, in an order of proof, the file Google attached to the
    calendar entry, then a document in a shared Drive folder, then a notice from
    Google in the caller's own mail, and `foundBy` says which one found it.
    `get_meeting_transcript` and `get_meeting_people` are the two reads beside it,
    both on `meetings:read`: the WORDS of a call, kept on the record so any
    colleague who may read meetings can read them, and which of the addresses on
    the invitation are our own members or contacts on our accounts.
    `sync_calendar_series` reads the caller's Google Calendar INTO Meetings, one
    way, always. Over a LIVE window reaching a fortnight back and four weeks
    forward: every entry with no record becomes one, repeating or not, past or
    future; every meeting in the window has its Google facts refreshed (the
    description, the location, the guests and what each answered, the organiser,
    the join link, the attachments, the link back to the entry); an entry called
    off in Google is cancelled here; and entries beyond the horizon come back
    read-only in `ahead`. It ALSO walks one slice of the caller's whole calendar —
    five years back to a year ahead — resuming from where the last call stopped,
    so `swept` says how far it has got and `caughtUp` says when it has finished.
    Call it repeatedly to bring in a history. The backward half of the live window
    is why a transcript that lands an hour after a call is ever found.
  - what we hand over, `create_deliverable`, `update_deliverable`,
    `set_deliverable_active`, `set_deliverable_visibility` (`deliverables:*`). A deliverable is one piece of
    material on an app — a handover doc, an API reference, a recorded
    walkthrough, an SOP — so `appId` rides on all three, and the ACCOUNT it was
    built for is copied off that app rather than sent. Its own module and not
    `processes`: opening an app and publishing against it are two grants. The
    BYTES are a screen action, as with every other upload here; `url` carries a
    link a machine already has, which is what most deliverables are.
    `set_deliverable_visibility` is the one that hands it over: a deliverable is
    invisible to the client until `visible` is set true, per row, and the client
    then reads it in their own portal. It CONFIRMS in that direction only —
    sharing puts material in somebody else's hands, hiding takes it back — the
    mirror of `set_deliverable_active`, which confirms on archiving.
  - the agency's own housekeeping, `create_brand_asset`,
    `update_brand_asset`, `set_brand_asset_active` (`brand_assets:*`);
    `create_meeting_purpose`, `update_meeting_purpose`, `set_meeting_purpose_active`
    (`delivery:*`); `save_staff_profile`, `set_staff_profile_active`,
    `create_staff_certificate`, `update_staff_certificate`,
    `set_staff_certificate_active` (`staff_profiles:*`).
  - the knowledge base, `add_knowledge_source`, `update_knowledge_source`,
    `set_knowledge_source_active`, `sync_knowledge`, `sync_google_knowledge`. The
    same acts a person has on the Knowledge base screen, gated by the same
    `knowledge:create` / `:edit` / `:delete` rights — so a token whose role cannot
    take a source away cannot ask the assistant to take one away either.
    `sync_knowledge` brings the base into step with the app's own rows one bounded
    slice at a time (call it while `caughtUp` is false); the 15-minute sweep does the
    same unattended. `sync_google_knowledge` does the same for the Google material
    the CALLER has already connected — their own Drive folders, the mail with a
    known contact, their calendar — acting as that person and gated `knowledge:create`
    **and** `google:read`. Read the Google paragraph below before you use it: it is
    the ONE tool on this surface that touches Google at all.

  **`ask_knowledge` never writes prose.** It answers with the passages it found and
  the SOURCES they came from, plus the compartment it searched and the sentence
  explaining why that one. When it finds nothing it says so, `found:false`, no
  passages, and a line to repeat instead of answering from memory (Law R23). A client
  building an answer out of it should quote the source titles; an answer with no
  citation is the exact failure that law exists to prevent.
- **Bulk create:** the import pipeline, `start_import` → `add_import_file` →
  `plan_import` → `run_import`. Accounts are importable AND exportable (they were
  importable only, which made the customer spine a one-way street).
- **The in-app assistant:** `agent_chat`, `agent_confirm`.

**Intentionally NOT on the machine surface, reasoned exclusions, not gaps.**

1. **The multi-row *mutation* tools** the in-app assistant uses,
   `bulk_set_help_status` and the set-shaped
   `set_help_status_by_filter`, are agent-only. They're built around the app's yes/no
   CONFIRM panel (a person approves the true count before a high-blast write runs); a
   headless MCP client has no such panel, so exposing them would be a blind mass-write.
   A machine client that needs the same effect composes the single-record writes above
   (each gated + audited identically). The bulk READ path, filtering a list to one
   record via `id`. IS on MCP (R19 parity).
2. **Teams, the PIN, not the word "team".** There is no tool that lists teams,
   makes one, or switches team, on either machine surface: a token is PINNED to one
   team by design
   (§5), and a tool that moved or made one would be the only way to widen that pin,
   which is the thing the pin exists to prevent. The two received-invitation doors are
   off for the same reason and more directly, accepting an invite JOINS another team
   and SWITCHES the session to it.

   RENAMING the pinned team is not that, and `update_team` is on this surface. It was
   agent-only on a reading of this exclusion that its own reason never supported: a
   rename moves nothing and reaches nowhere new. The same door, the same `teams:edit`
   gate, the same audit row.
3. **The client-portal standing doors**. `GET /api/tenancy/portal/context` and
   `POST /api/tenancy/portal/switch-account`, are off it too, and the reason is
   structural rather than a judgement call: they answer "which of *your own* companies
   are you standing in?", which is a question only a CLIENT login has, and a client
   login cannot hold a token at all (§5). For staff, both doors are already an honest
   empty answer. Adding them would be adding tools that no caller who can reach them
   has any use for.
4. **One invite's AUDIT trail and the cross-module ACTIVITY feed** are named, reasoned
   lines in the R19 census's `TOOLLESS_DOORS`, respectively: an invite's own state is
   already in `list_invites` and the audit is the forensic strip a person reads on its
   detail; and the activity feed is the one door whose answer is assembled by
   subtracting the caller's denied modules (R18), so putting the merged stream on this
   surface is a separate decision for the owner, not a parity default.

   The **role permission MATRIX** read is a surface asymmetry rather than a gap: the
   in-app assistant has `get_role_permissions`, and this surface reads the same matrix,
   flattened across every role and module, in `export_roles_csv`. One question, one way
   to ask it per surface.

5. **Auth's personal doors**, signing in, changing your login address, editing your
   name and photo, reading that identity history, and logging out, are off this
   surface. They write who the PERSON is, across every team they belong to; no team
   role gates any of them, so they sit outside the one-team, role-capped envelope a
   token promises. `whoami` and `my_permissions` are the machine's read of the same
   ground, inside it.

6. **The screen-recipe store and the knowledge upload.** A recipe describes what
   the agency app RENDERS, and the only way to judge one is to look at the screen it
   draws; the upload is a base64 data URL up to 25 MB, two orders of magnitude past
   what one call here is built to carry. A machine writes the source record with
   `add_knowledge_source` and references material it already has a URL for.

7. **Eight BODY FIELDS, across five doors that are otherwise fully here** (the
   reasoned set is `NARROWED_BODY_FIELDS` in `workers/mcp/test/filter-parity.test.ts`;
   the counts here are that list's, 26 Aug 2026). A tool
   may offer a narrower contract than its door accepts, but only in writing, and
   only for a reason. All of them are the same reason as item 6: **bytes, not
   prose.**
   - **`update_team` takes `name`, not `logoDataUrl`.** A logo is a base64 image data
     URL up to 2.5 MB — around 3.4 million characters of *argument* on a surface whose
     whole *answer* is capped at 400,000. Renaming is unaffected: the door treats an
     absent logo as "leave it as it is", so a machine rename can never blank a logo it
     cannot send. Set the logo in the app, on the Team screen.
   - **`complete_todo` takes `id`, not `fileDataUrl` or `fileName`.** A to-do's
     attachment is a base64 data URL up to 10 MB — around 14 million characters of
     argument on that same 400,000-character surface. And the file is the CLIENT's:
     "send us the signed contract" is answered by the person who has it, from their
     own portal. Marking the to-do done from a machine is a legitimate act — the
     thing arrived by email and somebody is tidying up — so `id` is exposed and
     forwarded and the capability is whole. `fileName` is read only inside the
     `if (body.fileDataUrl …)` branch, so offering it alone would be a field that
     changes nothing, which is worse than an absent one.
   - **`add_help_link` takes `label` and `url`, not `kind` or `fileDataUrl`.** A
     ticket holds several files and several links; this surface can send the links.
     A file is a base64 data URL up to 10 MB — around 14 million characters of
     argument on that same 400,000-character surface — and it is attached from a
     screen by the person holding it. `kind` is withheld for the other reason in
     item 7's family: the tool forwards it as the constant `"link"`, so the door's
     contract is honoured in full, and an argument that may hold exactly one value
     is only a way to get it wrong.
   - **`add_story_link` takes `label` and `url`, not `kind` or `fileDataUrl`.** The
     ticket door's line, one table along and for the same two reasons: the tool
     forwards `kind` as the constant `"link"`, so the door's contract is honoured
     whole, and a story's file — a screenshot of the work — is a base64 data URL up
     to 10 MB, uploaded from the screen by the person who took it.
   - **`update_story_attachment` takes `label` and `url`, not `fileDataUrl`.** The
     door beside `add_story_link`, and the same objection to the same field: it
     renames anything on a story and repoints a link, both of which are prose, and
     it cannot send the replacement BYTES for a file, which are a base64 data URL
     up to 10 MB. A file is swapped from the screen by the person holding the
     right one.
   - **`agent_chat` takes `message`, not `files`.** Attaching up to 8 CSVs of 5 MB each
     is up to 40 MB on the same surface — and the capability is already here in a
     better machine shape: `start_import` → `add_import_file` → `plan_import` →
     `run_import` is deterministic, resumable, and re-readable for free through
     `get_import` when a client loses a plan. Conversational file-drop is the shape a
     person supervises on a screen.

   Two other narrowings **were** here and are now closed, because neither had a reason
   that survived being written down: `create_role` takes its `permissions` matrix (the
   door demands `member_roles:edit` on top of `member_roles:create` when one arrives,
   its own double gate is the control, and the two-call path via `set_role_permissions`
   reached the same end state anyway), and `reply_help_ticket` takes `taggedUserIds` (a
   client login is refused mentions at the door and cannot hold a token at all, so every
   caller here is staff, inside the envelope the door already reasons about; the ids come
   from `list_members`, and the door still de-dupes them, strips your own, caps the list
   at 50 and resolves each through `team_members` so no address outside the team is
   reachable). **Law R22 keeps this list honest**: every field a write door reads must be
   in its tool's schema and forwarded by its `buildBody`, or be a named line beside the
   check, derived from the door's own source, so a fifth narrowing cannot land unseen.

Every tool is a thin forward to the **same gated door the app's own screens use**, so
input is validated, **your live role is re-checked** (a Viewer's `create_role` is
refused, exactly as in the UI), and the change gets the same audit trail and live-sync
as if a person had done it in the UI. The **deactivate-not-delete** model holds (nothing
is hard-deleted) and the locked guards fire even here (you can't remove yourself or the
last admin). A test (`workers/mcp/test/catalog.test.ts`) fails the build if the catalog
ever drifts from those real doors.

There is deliberately **no confirm step on the direct write tools**, calling
`remove_member` *is* the intent (like clicking through the UI's confirm) — though
since 26 Aug 2026 every tool the app itself would pause on says so in its
description, so your client can put a person in front of it first. Route
genuinely uncertain, natural-language actions through `agent_chat` instead: it proposes,
you approve with `agent_confirm`.

**Google is almost entirely off this surface, and that is on purpose, but read
the exception.** The eighteen tools that BROWSE and CHANGE a person's Drive, Gmail
and Chat (`google_drive_files`, `google_mail_search`, `google_send_mail`,
`google_chat_post`, `google_mail_trash` and the rest — twenty-one Google tools in
all, counting the connections list and the two calendar reads) belong to the
**in-app assistant** and to nothing
else: no MCP tool forwards to any of those doors. A personal access token is a
secret pasted into somebody's CI config, and the blast radius of a leaked one
must not include a mailbox. If you need Google material browsed through a
machine, ask the assistant, `agent_chat` reaches those tools under the same
rights, with the same confirm rules (mail always asks), and spends the team's AI
allowance while doing so.

**The calendar is not on that list in either direction, because nothing writes to
it any more.** Six calendar tools sat in the assistant's set and a seventh,
`add_meeting_to_calendar`, was the one write tool on THIS surface. All seven went
on 18 August 2026 with the doors under them: kwapso reads a calendar and never writes
one. The open question this section used to hold — whether pushing a meeting from
a machine was right when pushing a sprint was assistant-only — is answered by
neither being possible. `google_calendar_events` and `google_meeting_transcript`
remain, and both are reads, on the assistant's side.

**THREE tools still cross the line into Google, and this paragraph used to name
only one of them** *(fact updated 26 Aug 2026: the two meeting-side reads below
were on this surface all along — §3 documents both — while this security section,
the one a reader consults before handing a token to a third party, said ONE)*.
Each is gated exactly as its door is and reaches nobody else's account, but they
belong in front of you rather than in a catalogue you skim:

- **`sync_google_knowledge`** does not browse Google, but it does READ it: gated
  `knowledge:create` **and** `google:read`, it sweeps the caller's own connected
  Drive folders, the mail with a known contact and their calendar into the knowledge
  base, from which `ask_knowledge`, also on this surface, hands the passages back.
  A leaked token therefore reaches its OWN owner's Google material by that route,
  which is narrower than the browse tools (nobody else's account, no send, no
  delete) but is not nothing, and is not what "the MCP catalogue exposes none of
  them" led a reader to expect.
- **`sync_calendar_series`** reads the caller's own Google Calendar live, into
  Meetings — one way, always; nothing here writes to a calendar. Its door demands
  `google:read` beside the meetings right.
- **`read_meeting_transcript`** hunts a meeting's transcript through the caller's
  own Google, in order of proof: the file attached to the calendar entry, then a
  document in a shared Drive folder, then Google's own notice in the caller's
  mail. Same shape at the door: `google:read` beside `meetings:edit`.

What a leaked token reaches, then, is its owner's calendar, the transcript
documents their own Google can see, and whatever the knowledge sweep already
covers — never a send, never a delete, never anybody else's account.

It is recorded here rather than quietly removed because taking a capability off a
published surface breaks somebody's script, and that is a decision with an owner.
The seven calendar tools ARE that decision, made by the owner in words, and a
script that called one now gets a clean refusal rather than a silent no-op.

**What the assistant can now do there, and what it still cannot.** The module used
to be able to read all four services and write only three things, a file into a
named folder, a draft, an event. The event half is gone (the calendar is
read-only); it can now also rewrite a file, make a folder,
file a message or a whole conversation into Drive as a readable document, reply
inside a thread, put a Gmail label on a message or take it off, list every Chat
space the person can see, and reach a meeting's transcript from the calendar event
rather than by already knowing which document it is. It could once change an
event's title, times, guests or location and call one off; it cannot, because the
calendar is read-only in this product. Two of those tools exist only so the
others are safe to have: `google_drive_trash` and `google_chat_delete` undo what
kwapso itself wrote, the bin rather than a delete, and only a message this app
sent. What it still cannot do is unchanged and is the point: connect an account,
disconnect one, or widen what it is allowed to see.

Three Google doors have no tool on **either** surface, for a reason that is not
about caution: connecting an account is a person standing at Google's own consent
screen, and the credential it produces travels in an HttpOnly cookie no bearer
caller holds. Four more, disconnecting, and changing which folders and spaces
are shared, are decisions about **who can read what**, which is the one thing
this module exists to keep conscious. And one answers with an IMAGE rather than
data: the Drive thumbnail a screen shows beside a file, which a model cannot read
about a file it can already open as text. All eight are written down with their
reasons in `TOOLLESS_DOORS` (`workers/mcp/test/filter-parity.test.ts`), and the
check fails if one of them quietly grows a tool.

## 4 · Who pays? (the cost model. Read this)

**Most tools cost you nothing beyond a normal API request.** Reads, exports, imports,
and token management are just calls to our Cloudflare Workers + databases, cheap, no
AI involved. The developer does **not** bring their own AI billing, and does **not**
pay Anthropic, they're hitting our endpoints.

**Two kinds of tool DO draw the team's AI budget** (because they use the assistant):

| Tool | AI cost | Bounded by |
|---|---|---|
| `agent_chat`, `agent_confirm` | Yes, one assistant turn each | The **team's AI quota** (free per day + purchased credits) AND needs the **AI-agent right** |
| `plan_import` | Yes, one assistant unit per plan | The team's AI quota |
| `ask_knowledge` **with `compose`** | Yes, one unit per question | The team's AI quota AND needs the **AI-agent create right** |
| everything else | No |, |

**And "one turn" is one internal model step, not one message** (noted 26 Aug 2026).
A simple question is one step; a complex message can take up to 12 (`MAX_STEPS` in
`workers/data-ops/src/lib/agent.ts`), each drawing one unit — so budget a range per
message, not a constant.

**Where the knowledge tools fall, and the one line in the table that has two sides.**
`ask_knowledge` is a READ and it is free *as you will normally call it*: finding the
material spends ONE embedding of the question, a rounding error beside an assistant
turn, and nothing writes a word. Set `compose` and the app additionally writes the
answer out of those passages on a cheap model and returns it as `answer` — one unit
of the team's quota, one model call, gated on the same **AI-agent create right** as
`agent_chat`, so a token without the assistant gets the passages and spends nothing,
exactly as it did before the flag existed.

**Leave `compose` off unless you have nothing that can write.** An assistant calling
this composes its own reply from the passages — that is what Law R23 is for — so
asking the app to write one as well pays for the same answer twice. The flag exists
for a caller that has no model of its own; kwapso's own Knowledge tab is one, which
is why the flag is there at all.

`sync_knowledge` spends one embedding per CHANGED chunk and nothing at all for a row
whose text has not moved, so filling the base for the first time over an agency's
entire history measured at roughly a cent, and the steady state at about nothing.

That AI cost lands on **the team's quota** (our Anthropic key), **not** on the
developer. So two levers keep it under control:

1. **The quota is the ceiling.** All AI use, humans in the app + every machine token
   on the team, draws the same daily allowance (`AGENT_FREE_DAILY`, plus any
   top-up). When it's spent, `agent_chat` / `plan_import` return a clean "out of AI
   requests" (HTTP 429) until it resets or an admin adds credits. A runaway script
   can't run up an unbounded bill, it hits the quota wall.
2. **Scope the role.** A token can only call `agent_chat` / `agent_confirm` — or pass
   `compose` to `ask_knowledge` — if its role holds the **AI-agent create right**. Give
   a developer a role **without** it and those return 403, their token literally cannot
   spend agent AI budget. Reads, exports, asking the knowledge base without `compose`,
   and running a *pre-planned* import all stay available. (`plan_import` is the one
   import step that uses AI, bounded by the quota like everything else.)

So your instinct is right for the cheap tools ("they're just hitting our endpoints"),
and for the AI tools, the allowance + the role are how you keep the cost yours-but-bounded,
or zero, by choice.

**And you can now read the allowance before you spend it.** `get_ai_allowance` returns
what the team has left of the app's own daily allowance (the free daily amount plus any
credits an admin has added); `list_ai_usage` shows where it went, one row per turn. Both
are free reads needing `agent:read`. Until they existed, 429 was the documented failure
mode of this surface and nothing on it could see 429 coming, a client learned the
allowance was gone by being refused. (Note what this is *not*: it is the app's own daily
allowance, set here, shared by everyone on the team. It is not your Anthropic account and
not a bill anyone outside this app sees.)

**A lost plan is recoverable without re-spending it.** `plan_import` costs one request
of that allowance; `get_import` re-reads the same plan for free. A client that dropped a
`plan_import` response should come here rather than plan again.

---

## 5 · Security posture (what a token can't do)

- **It is the agency's surface, not its clients'.** A client-portal login is refused
  both a new token and a session for an existing one.

  This is worth spelling out, because nothing was ever *bypassed* here. A client
  contact **is** a team member, that is how the portal works, so they hold a role.
  When this was found, a client's role held `learning:read` for the ordinary reason
  that their own doors needed nothing from it, so signing in at the AGENCY address
  and minting a token let them call the learning list and export tools and receive
  every internal how-to article, in full, as a CSV. (That module was purged on
  17 Aug 2026 — team migration `0025` — so those tools no longer exist; the lesson
  outlived them.) The gate ran and PASSED. What kept those articles
  private was that the client portal's own gateway refuses that door outright, "the
  team's how-to articles are INTERNAL and carry no account fence", i.e. the protection
  was a **door-level** decision, and the machine surface had no door-level opinion at
  all.

  So it has one, in one sentence, asked in one place. Before minting, and before
  bridging a token to a session, the `mcp` worker asks **tenancy**, the worker that
  owns the fence, which kind of caller this is. It cannot answer that itself: the
  `portal_users` row lives in the per-team database and this worker holds no D1
  credential, and inventing a second way to decide who is a client is the exact thing
  interface-parity exists to prevent. The check **fails closed** in both directions: a
  caller who reads as a client is refused, *and so is one tenancy could not answer for*
 , a door that assumed "staff" whenever the check itself broke would hand the surface
  back to precisely the caller it excludes, on precisely the day something is wrong.
  Revoked grants count as client too: portal-ness is decided by the PRESENCE of the
  row, never by its absence.
  **How fresh is that answer?** The bridge mints one short-lived team-pinned session
  per token and re-uses it for **60 seconds**, so a burst of tool calls in one
  conversation shares one session instead of writing a session row each time,
  and nothing is cached until the staff check has passed. For that minute, then,
  a passed authorization decision stands without being re-asked, which is worth
  being precise about rather than waving at. The decision has **no transition to
  miss**: to hold a working token you must be an *active member* of the pinned
  team (auth's mint refuses anyone else, every time), and to read as a *client*
  you must have a portal-access row, which the only door that writes one refuses
  to give an active team member, because a client login would fence a colleague
  out of the agency app. The two states are mutually exclusive at every instant.
  That refutation isn't a paragraph to be taken on trust: `staff-only.test.ts`
  reads tenancy's and auth's own source and turns red if either refusal relaxes,
  which is the moment the cache goes rather than quietly becoming the hole.
  (Everything else stays live regardless: the token is re-verified per request, a
  revoke drops the cached session immediately, and every door re-runs
  `requireRight`, the account fence and the internal-material refusal on each
  call.)
- **Acts AS the owner, capped by their LIVE role**, re-checked on every call. Demote
  the person and the token weakens the same instant.
- **One team only.** The token is pinned to the team it was made in; it can never read
  or write another team's data (isolation by physics, separate databases).
- **No god mode.** The tool catalog is **opt-in**, only the listed, gated actions are
  exposed. Internal/maintenance endpoints, other people's device sessions, deleting the
  team: not in the catalog, structurally unreachable. Every write route gates on a
  permission (machine-checked. Law R10), so a tool can't skip the gate.
- **Writes are reversible + audited.** The write tools deactivate, never hard-delete;
  every change stamps an audit block (who + when) and the locked guards fire even here,
  you can't remove yourself or the last admin.
- **An assistant turn records that a MACHINE ran it.** `agent_chat` and `agent_confirm`
  reach the same handler the in-app assistant does, and that handler used to stamp every
  turn "in-app", so a token-driven conversation was written into the team's history as
  if somebody had typed it. It now records the calling surface, derived from the session
  itself (a token's session is team-pinned; a browser's never is), so it is not something
  a caller can state about itself in a header. Nothing about rights changed; what changed
  is that after a leaked token, "did a token do this, or did a person?" has an answer.
- **Revoke bites immediately.** The token is re-verified on every request, so revoking
  it stops the next call, even if a session was mid-flight.
- **It runs out on its own.** Every token carries a deadline (90 days), checked beside
  the revoke check on every call, so a secret forgotten in an old CI config stops being
  a key whether or not anyone remembers it. A token row with no deadline is refused
  rather than trusted.
- **And it stays reachable.** One person holds at most 10 live tokens, and the settings
  list shows unrevoked ones first, so a token that still works is always on the
  screen, and always revocable. (It was previously possible to bury a live token behind
  more than 1,000 revoked ones and lose the ability to revoke it from the app.)
- **Hashed at rest.** Only the token's hash is stored; the secret is shown once.

**Two honest limits:**

1. **The rate limit is per token OWNER, not per token** (this item said "no
   per-token rate limit yet" until 26 Aug 2026, which had stopped being the useful
   truth). Every `/mcp` request passes `callerHasBudget` — 600 requests a minute,
   keyed `machine:<user_id>`, checked immediately after the token is verified and
   before the JSON-RPC body is even parsed (`workers/mcp/src/index.ts`;
   `CALLER_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE` in `shared/workers/limits.ts` says why 600) — and
   the gated doors behind it carry their own per-worker budgets on top. Two honest
   edges remain: two tokens owned by the same person share one bucket, and the
   limiter FAILS OPEN where the `CALLER_LIMIT` binding is absent or unwell (a broken
   safety valve must not become the outage; the fail-open path logs). Every write is
   still reversible (deactivate-not-delete), audited, and one-team. If you hand a
   token to a *less*-trusted integration, prefer a tightly-scoped role and watch
   `last_used_at`.
2. **`member_roles:edit` is a powerful right.** Anyone who can edit roles can grant
   permissions, including to their own role, exactly as in the UI (there's no separate
   admin tier). So give a machine token that right only when the integration genuinely
   manages roles; a read/import/export integration never needs it.

### An open question, answered by the owner, the calendar tool on this surface

This section used to hold a live question: `add_meeting_to_calendar` was on the
machine catalogue and its twin `google_sprint_to_calendar` was the in-app
assistant's alone, the two did the same kind of act behind the same three gates,
and nothing recorded which placement was intended. The question underneath it was
*should an outside developer holding a personal access token be able to write into
a colleague's calendar?*

**Answered on 2026-08-18, and wider than the question asked:** *"disable the
ability to create, edit, or delete anything in the calendar from the frontend…
just make it one-way so we only grab and update the information."* Neither tool
exists now, on either surface, and neither do the doors under them. Removing one
tool would have meant a new field on the shared type, a filter, and amendments to
the R9, R19 and R22 parity checks; removing the DOORS meant none of that, because
a tool with no door is not a narrowing anybody has to describe — the parity checks
derive their obligations from the doors themselves and simply have fewer.

The lesson worth keeping: an asymmetry nobody can explain is usually two things
that should both go, or both stay. Six weeks of "one of these placements is wrong
and it is the owner's call which" ended with the owner deleting the category.

## 6 · For maintainers (where it lives)

`workers/mcp/`. `POST /mcp` (JSON-RPC) + session-gated token management under
`/api/mcp/tokens*`; the staff-only rule is `workers/mcp/src/lib/staff.ts` (called from
`postToken` and from the session bridge, held by `test/staff-only.test.ts`); the
human-facing card is `web/components/access-tokens.tsx`
(Settings → Access tokens). Tokens live in the core DB (`mcp_tokens`, migrations
`0013` + `0016`, `expires_at`, backfilled so applying it gives every existing token a
full term rather than killing it); the TTL and the per-person cap are
`MCP_TOKEN_TTL_DAYS` / `MAX_ACTIVE_MCP_TOKENS_PER_USER` in
`shared/workers/limits.ts`, and `workers/mcp/test/tokens.test.ts` runs the real
migrations against a real SQLite database to hold all three fixes in place.
A token is bridged to a **short-lived team-pinned session** via auth's
`/internal/mcp-session` (INTERNAL_KEY, fail-closed). The **agency** gateway routes
`/mcp` + `/api/mcp/*` to the worker; the mcp worker itself is `workers_dev:false`,
so that gateway is the only way in. The client portal's gateway does NOT bind the
mcp worker at all and refuses `/mcp` outright, the machine surface is not on the
client internet. See ARCHITECTURE.md (the `mcp` row) and DATA-MODEL.md
(`mcp_tokens` + `sessions.team_pin`).
