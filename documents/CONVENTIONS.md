# CONVENTIONS.md, code + comment conventions

The house style of the Kwapso System server. This is the *how we write code here* companion
to [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) (the locked decisions) and [RULES.md](../RULES.md)
(the machine-checked laws). Everything below is grounded in code that already exists,
where a rule has a canonical file, it's named. A new developer (or an AI agent like
Claude Code) should be able to read this once and write a new worker route that looks
like it was always here.

The prime directive sits above every convention: **stay lean**. This codebase is
deliberately small and well-layered. Add the least code that solves the problem, reuse
the existing seams, and don't introduce a dependency, a worker, a table, or an
abstraction you don't need. **"Too much code" is a defect**, a bloated diff fails the
`lean_mean` ship gate the same way a broken test fails `npm run check`.

## 0 · Decision trees, what to reach for

Before the "how" below, the "what": when a change could take several shapes, reach for
the **smallest** one first and only climb when it genuinely can't hold the need. This is
the concrete form of the planning ritual's step 4 (CLAUDE.md).

- **A new capability → a route on an existing worker.** Almost never a new worker, the
  roster is locked (ARCHITECTURE.md). A new module = new routes on the worker that owns
  its domain (tenancy for team-scoped config and the customer spine, content for
  record-shaped modules a person authors, tickets, the brand library, the knowledge
  base, data-ops for import/agent). A new worker is an ARCHITECTURE decision (a
  genuinely new bounded context with its own scaling/security boundary), not a
  build-time one.
- **New data → a column, then a table, then a database.** A column on an existing table
  if it belongs to that record; a new **per-team** table for a new module's records; a
  new **core** table only for global identity / billing / a cross-team index. Never a
  database per feature, the **per-team DB is the tenancy + sharding unit** (BASE-MANUAL §6).
- **Coordinating a write → atomic conditional SQL, then a unique index, then a Durable
  Object.** (CONCURRENCY.md's three tools.) A DO only for a hot, contended, multi-step
  invariant; otherwise atomic D1. A *retryable* multi-row op → claim it atomically first
  (idempotency).
- **A screen → a recipe, then a bespoke host component.** Engine-expressible (a list or
  detail of shaped rows + description-lists + activity) → a recipe in `screens.ts`. A
  control the engine has no block for (permission matrix, rich body, thread) → a bespoke
  component (UI-CONVENTIONS §2b).
- **Exposing an action to machines → declare it ONCE in the shared tool catalog.** If
  BOTH the in-app agent and the MCP should expose an endpoint (most CRUD), add one entry
  to `shared/workers/tool-catalog.ts` (`SHARED_TOOLS`: path · method · binding · schema ·
  buildBody · summary, plus the agent's `write`/`confirm`/`summarize`), the agent
  (`toAgentTool`) and MCP (`toMcpTool`) both pick it up, so they can't drift. A tool for
  only ONE surface stays in that surface's file (the agent's bulk/SELF tools; the MCP's
  exports/import/agent-bridge). A WRITE also needs its `module:right` in `TOOL_GATES`,
  `shared/workers/tool-gates.ts`, which owns who-may-call-it and what-must-be-confirmed
  while the catalog owns the declarations; `workers/mcp/test/catalog.test.ts` fails the
  build if a write resolves to neither a gate nor a reason. The agent's confirm is `true`, or an input-aware
  predicate, if the act is DESTRUCTIVE, a PRIVILEGE GRANT, or bulk (other constructive writes run free, EDGE-CASES
  §5). Both forward through the SAME gated door. Never a second, ungated path.
- **A new invariant → a machine-checked Law if it can be source-scanned; else a
  convention + a targeted test.** Rule + registry entry + check land together (R-law
  discipline). A green test must assert the *right* intent, a test that locks the wrong
  behaviour is worse than none (the lesson behind R10/R12).

---

## 1 · The worker handler shape

Every domain worker (`auth`, `tenancy`, `content`, `data-ops`, `realtime`, `gateway`)
has the **same skeleton**. Once you've read one, you've read them all. The canonical
example is `workers/content/src/index.ts`.

### The switchboard: `index.ts` is a `ROUTES` table + one try/catch

`index.ts` does exactly two things, map each route to a handler, and centrally turn
thrown errors into clean responses. It contains **no business logic**.

```ts
// workers/content/src/index.ts
type RouteKind = "read" | "mutation" | "housekeeping"
type Handler = (request: Request, env: Env) => Promise<Response>

export const ROUTES: Record<string, { handler: Handler; kind: RouteKind }> = {
  "GET  /api/content/brand-assets":        { handler: getBrandAssets,       kind: "read" },
  "POST /api/content/brand-assets":        { handler: postCreateBrandAsset, kind: "mutation" },
  "POST /api/content/brand-assets/update": { handler: postUpdateBrandAsset, kind: "mutation" },
  "POST /api/content/brand-assets/active": { handler: postSetBrandAssetActive, kind: "mutation" },
  "POST /api/content/brand-assets/upload": { handler: postUploadBrandAsset, kind: "housekeeping" },
  // …
}
```

The route key is the literal `"METHOD /path"` string, so dispatch is a single map
lookup, no router library, no regex, no path params in the door (ids arrive as
`?id=` query params or in the JSON body). `export const ROUTES` is exported **on
purpose**: the seam test (`test/publish-seam.test.ts`) reads it straight off disk.

### Route kinds, the can't-forget classifier (Law R1)

Every route carries a `kind`. This is not decoration; it is the structural guarantee
that live-sync can't be silently skipped:

| kind | meaning |
|------|---------|
| `read` | a GET; changes nothing, broadcasts nothing. |
| `mutation` | changes state → **must** broadcast a change ping (`publishChange` / `publishUserChange`). |
| `housekeeping` | the reviewed deny-list: a write that intentionally broadcasts nothing (a private session pointer, a file-only R2 write with no row to patch). Adding one is a conscious choice. |

A new non-GET route with no `kind` fails the type-check; a new `mutation` that forgets
to publish fails `publish-seam.test.ts`; adding a `housekeeping` route means editing a
locked deny-list set in the test, which is a visible, reviewed line. See the actual
comment block at the top of `ROUTES` in `workers/content/src/index.ts` and
[CACHING.md](CACHING.md).

### The one try/catch that maps `GuardError` → response

The `fetch` handler is small and identical across workers:

```ts
// workers/content/src/index.ts
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    const { pathname } = new URL(request.url)
    const route = `${request.method} ${pathname}`
    try {
      if (route === "GET /api/content/health") return json({ ok: true })
      const def = ROUTES[route]
      if (!def) return fail(404, "not_found", "No such content action.")
      return await def.handler(request, env)
    } catch (e) {
      if (e instanceof GuardError) return fail(e.status, e.code, e.message)
      console.error("content worker error:", e)
      const message = e instanceof Error ? e.message : ""
      if (message.startsWith("cloud_key_missing:"))
        return fail(503, "cloud_key_missing", `${brand.name}'s cloud key isn't set up yet — content is paused.`)
      return fail(500, "internal", "Something went wrong on our side. Try again.")
    }
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>
```

The rules that follow from this:

- **Handlers throw; the door catches.** A handler never builds its own 4xx/5xx for a
  rule failure, it throws `GuardError(status, code, message)` and lets the central
  catch turn it into a response. There is exactly one place that formats an error body.
- **Every response goes through `json` / `fail`** from `shared/workers/http.ts`, the
  *one* pair of helpers, so the shape (`{ error, message }`, matching `ApiError` in
  `shared/types.ts`) is defined once:

  ```ts
  // shared/workers/http.ts
  export const fail = (status: number, error: string, message: string): Response =>
    json({ error, message } satisfies ApiError, status)
  ```
- **The catch never leaks internals.** An unexpected throw logs the real error server-side
  (`console.error`) and returns a generic `500 internal` with a warm, user-safe message.
  A missing cloud key is the one special-cased operator condition. This mirrors the
  never-swallow rule in [ERROR-HANDLING.md](ERROR-HANDLING.md).

### `GuardError` is the currency of failure

Defined once, in `shared/workers/gating.ts`:

```ts
export class GuardError extends Error {
  constructor(public status: number, public code: string, message: string) { super(message) }
}
```

`status` is the HTTP status, `code` is a stable machine string the client can branch on
(`not_member`, `forbidden`, `invalid_input`, `brand_asset_not_found`, …), `message` is
plain English safe to show the user. Throw it from anywhere in the call stack, gating,
validation, or a lib CRUD function (`assetOrThrow` in `lib/brand-assets.ts` throws a
`404 brand_asset_not_found`), and it surfaces as a clean response without a single
hand-built error path in between.

### Housekeeping beyond routes: `scheduled`

A worker with nightly work adds a `scheduled` handler next to `fetch` in the same
default export, and it follows the same never-swallow shape. Try, do the job, log, and
never let a cron failure escape:

```ts
// workers/tenancy/src/index.ts
/** Nightly cron: the estate's housekeeping — size alarms + the core retention sweep. */
async scheduled(_controller, env): Promise<void> {
  // ONE TRY PER JOB. Sharing a catch means a failing sweep hides an 80% alarm.
  try {
    const swept = await sweepCoreRetention(env.DB)
    console.log(`retention sweep: ${JSON.stringify(swept.deleted)}`)
    if (swept.capped.length) await recordWorkerError(env.DB, "tenancy", "cron/retention", …)
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("nightly retention sweep failed:", e)
    await recordWorkerError(env.DB, "tenancy", "cron/retention", e)
  }
  try {
    const result = await checkDatabaseSizes(env, d1Config(env))
    console.log(`size check: ${result.checked} DBs, ${result.alerted.length} alarm(s)`)
    if (result.capped) await recordWorkerError(env.DB, "tenancy", "cron/size-check", …)
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("nightly size check failed:", e)
    await recordWorkerError(env.DB, "tenancy", "cron/size-check", e)
  }
},
```

Two rules the shape above encodes, both learned the hard way:

- **R12 covers the CEILING, not just the crash.** Bounded unattended work that stops
  early is not an exception, so the catch never sees it, and a cheerful "N alarm(s)"
  line is the only thing anyone reads. A run that hit its ceiling is RECORDED, saying
  what was *not* done.
- **One try per independent job.** Two jobs under one catch means the first one's
  failure silently cancels the second.

Only add a cron when there's real housekeeping, `content` has none, and says so in a
comment rather than shipping an empty stub.

## 2 · The handler body, the fixed opening

Inside a route handler (see `workers/content/src/routes/brand-assets.ts`) the steps run
in a fixed order. Deviating is a smell; matching it is how the next reader knows what
they're looking at before they read a line.

```ts
export async function postCreateBrandAsset(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
  const { actor, cfg, guard, body } = await gatedBody<BrandAssetInput>(   // 1 · 2 · 3
    request, env, "brand_assets", "create"
  )
  await refusePortalCaller(cfg, guard)                                    // 4 · whose world?
  requireText(body.name, "Name", TEXT_LIMITS.short)                       // 5 · validate
  const id = await createBrandAsset(cfg, guard, actor, body)              // 6 · CRUD via lib
  await publishChange(env, guard.teamId, "brand_assets", id, "add")       // 7 · publish live
  return json({                                                           // 8 · respond
    assets: await listBrandAssets(cfg, guard),
    total: await countBrandAssets(cfg, guard),                            // R16: the exact total
  })
}
```

1. **`teamContext(request, env)`**, the shared opening (§4). Destructure only what you
   use: `cfg` (the D1 REST config), `guard` (the validated membership), `actor` (the
   audit stamp), `user`.
2. **`requireRight(cfg, guard, module, right)`**, the permission gate (§4). Always
   before any read or write. Security is never just hiding UI.
3. **Read the body defensively**, `(await request.json().catch(() => ({}))) as T`. A
   malformed body becomes `{}`, never a throw; the `as T` is a *shape hint*, not a
   promise the fields are valid, that's step 5's job.

   Steps 1–3 are the same three lines in about fifty handlers, so they are collapsed
   into one awaited call: **`gated(request, env, module, right)`** for a read and
   **`gatedBody<B>(…)`** for a write (`shared/workers/route.ts`). It is deliberately
   *not* a wrap-the-whole-handler decorator, handlers stay plain
   `export async function`s, because the seam tests read each handler's source by name
   straight off disk. A handler that gates unusually (two rights, a body-derived
   module, an admin-key check) simply doesn't use these and writes the steps out.
4. **Decide about a client login, at the door** (Law R21). A door on the agency's own
   material calls `refusePortalCaller`; a door on shared material resolves the account
   fence with `accountScope` instead. Neither is optional and neither happens later,
   the whole point of R21 is that the decision is made where the request arrives.
5. **Validate at the boundary**, `requireText` / `optionalText` / `queryText` (§5).
6. **CRUD through the lib layer**. Never inline SQL in a route (§3, §6).
7. **Publish the live change**, one row-level ping per changed row (Law R1, §7).
8. **Respond via `json`**, carrying the collection's exact server total (Law R16).

Reads collapse to the gated opening, then the query and `json`:

```ts
export async function getBrandAssets(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
  const { cfg, guard } = await gated(request, env, "brand_assets", "read")
  await refusePortalCaller(cfg, guard)
  const assets = await listBrandAssets(cfg, guard)
  const id = queryText(new URL(request.url).searchParams.get("id"), "Id") // ?id= → one asset
  return json({
    assets: id ? assets.filter((a) => a.id === id) : assets,
    total: await countBrandAssets(cfg, guard),
  })
}
```

Note the query string goes through `queryText` rather than being read raw: R20 holds
the query half to the same positional rule as the body half (§5).

---

## 3 · Data access, two doors, never a third

There are exactly **two** ways to touch a database, and the choice is decided by *which*
database:

| Database | How you reach it | Helper |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| **Global core** (`users`, `teams`, `team_members`, login codes, import registry) | the native `env.DB` binding | `env.DB.prepare(sql).bind(…).first()/.run()/.all()` |
| **Per-team** (roles, help, brand assets, activity, selectable data, …) | the Cloudflare D1 **REST door** | `d1Query` / `d1ExecScript` in `shared/workers/d1-rest.ts` |

Per-team databases are created at *runtime*, so they can't be pre-wired bindings, the
REST door (`d1-rest.ts`) is the *one file* every team-data touch goes through, which is
also where sharding routing plugs in. Do not add a third path.

### Native binding, parameterized, always

Core-DB access uses D1's prepared statements with `.bind(...)`. Untrusted values are
**always** bound, never concatenated:

```ts
// workers/auth/src/index.ts
const recent = await env.DB.prepare(
  "SELECT COUNT(*) AS n FROM login_codes WHERE email = ? AND created_at > ?"
).bind(email, hourAgo).first<{ n: number }>()
```

### REST door, `d1Query` for reads, `d1ExecScript` for writes

- **`d1Query<Row>(cfg, databaseId, sql, params)`** runs one parameterized statement and
  returns typed rows. Use it for every read (and single-statement writes where params
  work). Parameters are bound, same discipline as the native binding.

  ```ts
  const rows = await d1Query<{ id: string }>(
    cfg, guard.databaseId,
    "SELECT id FROM selectable_data WHERE type = ? AND value = ? AND deactivated_at IS NULL",
    [CATEGORY_TYPE, clean]
  )
  ```

- **`d1ExecScript(cfg, databaseId, script)`** runs a multi-statement script. The REST
  API **forbids parameters** in script mode, so values are inlined, and inlining is
  where the *only* string-building rule lives: **every inlined value goes through
  `sqlString` (or `sqlValue`)**, never a bare template literal.

  ```ts
  // workers/content/src/lib/brand-assets.ts — createBrandAsset
  await d1ExecScript(cfg, guard.databaseId,
    `INSERT INTO brand_assets (id, name, category, description, created_at, creator_id, creator_email, creator_name)
     VALUES (${sqlString(id)}, ${sqlString(v.name)}, ${sqlString(v.category)}, ${sqlString(v.description)},
             ${sqlString(now)}, ${sqlString(actor.id)}, ${sqlString(actor.email)}, ${sqlString(actor.name)});`)
  ```

### `sqlString` / `sqlValue` / `ulid`, the three primitives

- **`sqlString(value)`** escapes a value for inlining (`''`-doubling) and, defence in
  depth. `String()`-coerces any non-string runtime value *first*, so a field typed
  `string` that arrives as a number/object/array can never break the one SQL door:

  ```ts
  // shared/workers/d1-rest.ts
  export function sqlString(value: unknown): string {
    if (value === null || value === undefined) return "NULL"
    return `'${String(value).replaceAll("'", "''")}'`
  }
  ```

- **`sqlValue(value)`** is its numeric-aware sibling for copying cells (numbers inline
  bare, strings via `sqlString`, `null` → `NULL`).

- **Numbers still need coercing.** A field the route *types* as a number but doesn't
  validate at runtime is checked before it's interpolated — `Number()` plus a
  `Number.isFinite` guard at the boundary, or `sqlValue` at the statement seam.
  Never trust the `as` cast. (An `intOr` helper shipped for this and sat uncalled
  for months while every real site checked inline; the helper was deleted rather
  than left advertising a seam nothing used.)

- **`ulid()`** (`shared/workers/id.ts`) mints every row id. **Every row everywhere gets
  a ULID**, globally unique *and* time-sortable, so rows can move between databases
  (sharding) without collisions. Never use an auto-increment or a random UUID.

**The rule, stated once:** *never string-concat untrusted input into SQL.* Bound params
on both doors; `sqlString`/`sqlValue` for the script-mode inlines that can't take
params. There is no third option, and there is no exception.

---

## 4 · The gating spine, `teamContext` → `requireRight`

Permissions are the spine of the whole base (ARCHITECTURE §2). The entire gating seam
lives in `shared/workers/gating.ts` so every worker gates **identically, with zero
duplication**.

**`teamContext(request, env)`** is the standard opening every team-scoped handler
shares. In order it: asks the auth worker *who is calling* (`whoAmI` → the auth
worker's `/me`), rejects the signed-out (`401 signed_out`) and the teamless
(`409 no_team`), builds the D1 REST config, and validates the caller is an active
member of their **active** team (`requireMember` → `403 not_member`). It returns a
`TeamCtx`:

```ts
export type TeamCtx = { user: SessionUser; actor: Actor; cfg: D1Rest; guard: MemberGuard }
```

`guard` (`{ userId, teamId, roleId, databaseId }`) is the object every downstream query
threads through, `guard.databaseId` is *this team's* database, so isolation is by
physics: a handler literally cannot address another team's rows.

**`requireRight(cfg, guard, module, right)`** is the permission one-liner. It reads the
role's tall permission sheet (`role_permissions`) and throws `403 forbidden` if the
role lacks the right. Rights are the fixed set `"read" | "create" | "edit" | "delete"`.

```ts
export async function requireRight(cfg, guard, module, right): Promise<void> {
  // Name the missing right in plain words — a person (or the agent explaining a
  // refused step) can then see WHICH permission their role lacks, not just "no".
  if (!(await hasRight(cfg, guard, module, right)))
    throw new GuardError(
      403,
      "forbidden",
      `You don't have permission to do that — your role is missing the "${right}" right on ${module.replace(/_/g, " ")}.`
    )
}
```

Conventions that fall out of the spine:

- **Deactivate maps to `delete`.** Retiring a record (§6) is gated by the `delete`
  right, deactivate *is* our delete. See `postSetBrandAssetActive` gating on
  `"brand_assets", "delete"`.
- **Your own data uses `read`.** Joining a conversation on a ticket (`postHelpReply`)
  only needs `help:read`, any member who can see a ticket may reply to it, because
  the thing being written is their own words, not the record.
- **The AI agent is not special.** It acts **as the signed-in user through the same
  gated endpoints** and never exceeds their rights. There is no agent role, no bypass.
- **Operator endpoints** (`/admin/*`, seeds, migrations) use `adminGuard` (the
  `x-admin-key` header check) instead of `teamContext`. See `gating.ts`.

---

## 5 · Validate at the boundary (Law: input is validated at the door)

Never trust a request body. The `as T` cast in a handler is a shape *hint*, not a
guarantee. Real validation is a single seam: `shared/workers/validate.ts`.

The bug this seam fixes (documented in the file's own header comment): the old
`body.field?.trim()` pattern only guarded null/undefined, a non-string made `.trim`
undefined and threw a `TypeError` → the central catch turned it into a **500**. A NUL
byte (SQLite rejects `U+0000`) → another 500. An uncapped multi-MB string bloated a row
or 500'd. **Bad input must be a clean 400, never a 500.**

```ts
// shared/workers/validate.ts
export function requireText(value: unknown, field: string, max = TEXT_LIMITS.long): string {
  if (typeof value !== "string") throw new GuardError(400, "invalid_input", `${field} must be text.`)
  const clean = stripNul(value).trim()
  if (!clean) throw new GuardError(400, "invalid_input", `${field} is required.`)
  if (clean.length > max) throw new GuardError(400, "invalid_input", `${field} is too long (max ${max} characters).`)
  return clean
}
```

- **`requireText(value, field, max)`**, a required field: type-check, strip NULs, trim,
  cap length, or throw a clean `400 invalid_input`.
- **`optionalText(value, field, max)`**, null/undefined/blank → `undefined`; otherwise
  the same checks.
- **`TEXT_LIMITS`**, the per-kind caps (`short: 200`, `link: 2_048`, `long: 20_000`,
  `message: 10_000`). Pick the tightest that fits the field.

Use them at the top of the write, before the value reaches the lib:

```ts
requireText(body.title, "Title", TEXT_LIMITS.short)
const category = optionalText(input.category, "Category", TEXT_LIMITS.short) ?? null
```

The query string is held to the same rule: **`queryText(searchParams.get(…), field)`**,
never a raw read. R20's census walks both halves, and "the helper's behaviour is locked"
is a different sentence from "every door uses it".

For other value shapes there's no one-size helper by design, validate inline and
specifically (`typeof body.active !== "boolean"` → `fail(400, "invalid_input", …)`; a
list of ids via `requireIdList`). Typed fields get a purpose-built door of their own:
`safeExternalLink` allows only `http`/`https`/`mailto` (anything else is dropped,
a `javascript:` URL on a record is a stored-XSS payload the moment somebody clicks it),
and `optionalDate` refuses anything that isn't exactly a real calendar day rather than
coercing it, because a value that is *nearly* a date sorts, renders and is wrong. Both
live in `workers/content/src/lib/internal-fields.ts`. The core helpers' behaviour is
**locked** by `workers/content/test/validate.test.ts`: the 500s can't come back.

---

## 6 · Deactivate, never delete, and the audit block on every write

Two rules travel together and appear on **every** write (ARCHITECTURE §4).

### Deactivate, never delete

Records are *retired*, never removed. A `deactivated_at` timestamp (NULL = active)
marks the row while its data and history survive. There is no `DELETE` statement for a
MASTER record anywhere in the base — and since 25 Aug 2026 that sentence has one
reviewed carve-out, for a CHILD row, which is exactly the case ARCHITECTURE §4's
lock reserved the delete right for. A process STEP added by mistake can be
hard-deleted through `POST /api/tenancy/processes/steps/delete` (gated
`processes:delete`; the owner's explicit decision). The door refuses three things
by name — a step in an older version, a step any agreed version holds ("versions
stay exactly as they were agreed"), and a step a live step loops back to — and the
DELETE re-checks all three as predicates riding the statement itself, inside the
account fence. The step's revisions are deleted with it, an activity row ("Step
deleted") is written, and a portal caller is refused at the door. A step that was
ever part of an agreed version can only be switched off, never deleted, so the
saving it represents is never erased. (`workers/tenancy/src/lib/processes.ts`,
`deleteStep`; the smaller sibling deletes, all child rows too, are a
`process_links` row when two maps are disconnected — the connection is a
statement, not a record — a corrected day's replaced price row in
`client_tool_prices`, the join rows a whole-set write reconciles in
`client_role_departments` / `client_role_people`, and — the same whole-set
shape on content's side — the `story_processes` rows a story's process list
replaces (`workers/content/src/lib/stories.ts`).)

**Deactivate must stay reversible. Never a dead end.** A management LIST must still
RETURN deactivated rows (active first, each carrying an `active` flag) so the screen can
show them greyed with an Activate button and the owner can bring one back. Only the
form PICKERS filter to `active` (a retired value isn't offered as a new choice, but old
rows that referenced it still read truthfully). Do **not** filter a management list to
`WHERE deactivated_at IS NULL`, that hides the row *and* the way back (`listRoles`,
`listBrandAssets`, `listSelectable` all return inactive; only the pickers in
`use-screen-data.ts` drop it). Guarded for dropdown values by
`workers/tenancy/test/selectable-reactivatable.test.ts`.

```ts
// brand-assets.ts — setBrandAssetActive. The current-status predicate rides the
// UPDATE and the row comes back, so a repeat moves zero rows (Law R17).
const changed = await d1Query<{ id: string }>(cfg, guard.databaseId,
  active
    ? `UPDATE brand_assets SET deactivated_at = NULL, deactivator_id = NULL, deactivator_email = NULL, deactivator_name = NULL, updated_at = ? WHERE id = ? AND deactivated_at IS NOT NULL RETURNING id`
    : `UPDATE brand_assets SET deactivated_at = ?, deactivator_id = ${sqlString(actor.id)}, deactivator_email = ${sqlString(actor.email)}, deactivator_name = ${sqlString(actor.name)}, updated_at = ? WHERE id = ? AND deactivated_at IS NULL RETURNING id`,
  active ? [now, id] : [now, now, id])
if (!changed[0]) return false            // nothing moved → no activity row, no ping
```

`active === null` in the shaped type is derived from `deactivated_at === null`, the DB
column is the truth, the boolean is a convenience.

### The audit block, actor + timestamp on every write

Every write stamps *who* and *when*. The columns are consistent across tables:

- **create** → `created_at`, `creator_id`, `creator_email`, `creator_name`
- **edit** → `updated_at`, `editor_id`, `editor_email`, `editor_name`
- **deactivate** → `deactivated_at`, `deactivator_id`, `deactivator_email`,
  `deactivator_name` (reactivating clears them)

The actor comes from `teamContext`'s `actor` (`{ id, email, name }`), store the email
and name too, not just the id, so history reads without a join even if the user record
later changes.

### Log it to the activity feed

Every meaningful write also appends one row to the team's `activity` table via the *one*
shared writer, `logActivity` (`shared/workers/activity.ts`). It's **best-effort by
contract**, it swallows and logs its own failures, so a logging hiccup can never break
the action it describes. Callers just `await` it; no `.catch` needed.

```ts
// brand-assets.ts — after the INSERT
await logActivity(cfg, guard.databaseId, actor, {
  type: "Brand asset created",
  description: `${actor.name} added "${v.name}" to the brand library`,
  relatedTable: "brand_assets",
  relatedRowId: id,
})
```

Activity rows point at the changed record through a **generic** `(related_table,
related_row_id)` pair. Never a per-module column. That generic pair is what lets one
read path (Law R5) serve any module's history.

---

## 7 · Publish the live change (Law R1)

After a successful mutation, the handler pings the realtime worker so every open screen
patches **only the row that changed**. The helpers are in `shared/workers/realtime.ts`:

- **`publishChange(realtime, teamId, resource, id?, op?)`**, team-scoped data.
- **`publishUserChange(realtime, userId, resource, id?, op?)`**, identity-scoped data
  across one person's devices.
- **`publishSignOut(realtime, userId)`**, force-sign-out a user's other devices.

Two conventions matter:

- **Row-level, never list-level.** Pass the changed row's `id` so clients patch that one
  row instead of refetching the list (CACHING.md). For a bulk action, publish **one ping
  per changed row**. See `postBulkHelpStatus` (routes/help.ts) looping
  `for (const row of changed)`. A CSV import is the one sanctioned exception, and it
  publishes a single id-less ping on the target table rather than thousands.
- **The payload carries no row data**, `{ resource, id, op }` only. The client re-pulls
  the row through the permission-checked endpoint, so a live ping can never leak data.
  `op` (`add | edit | remove | session`) is *advisory*; the client verifies by re-pull.

Like `logActivity`, publishing is best-effort, a realtime hiccup logs but never throws,
so it can't break the write it announces.

---

## 8 · The `shared/` vs per-worker split

The line is simple: **if two workers would write it the same way, it lives in `shared/`.**

- **`shared/workers/`** holds the seams every worker reuses: `http.ts` (`json`/`fail`),
  `gating.ts` (`GuardError`, `teamContext`, `requireRight`), `validate.ts`, `d1-rest.ts`
  (`d1Query`/`d1ExecScript`/`sqlString`), `id.ts` (`ulid`), `activity.ts`
  (`logActivity`), `realtime.ts` (`publishChange`). Touch these carefully, a change
  ripples across all eight workers.
- **`shared/types.ts`** is the contract the `web/` client and the workers both agree
  on (`SessionUser`, `BrandAsset`, `ApiError`, …). Shape a DB row into a shared type at
  the lib boundary (`toAsset`) so the wire type is stable even as columns change.
- **`shared/rules/registry.ts`** and **`shared/glossary.ts`** / **`shared/brand.ts`** are
  the single sources of truth for the laws, the product vocabulary, and brand strings.
- **A worker's own `src/`** holds only what's specific to it: its `env.ts` (the bindings
  it's given), its `index.ts` switchboard, its `routes/*` (thin handlers), and its
  `lib/*` (the module's real CRUD + rules). Route files stay thin; module logic lives in
  `lib/`. `routes/brand-assets.ts` → `lib/brand-assets.ts` is the pattern to copy: one
  name, two files, and you can guess which half a line belongs in.

Each worker's `Env` (e.g. `workers/content/src/env.ts`) is written to **structurally
satisfy** the shared `GatingEnv` (`AUTH` + `DB` + the Cloudflare D1 credentials), which
is *why* the shared gating works unchanged in every worker. Add a binding to `env.ts`
only when that worker actually needs it, and comment what it's for.

---

## 9 · Comments, explain WHY, not WHAT

The code says *what*. A comment earns its place by saying *why*, the constraint, the
locked decision, the bug it's guarding against, the non-obvious trade-off. Match the
density of the surrounding file: a shared seam gets a header paragraph; a one-line guard
gets a one-line reason.

**File headers state the file's job and its locked rules.** From `d1-rest.ts`:

```ts
// THE data-access door to per-team databases (locked rule: one door).
// Team databases are created at runtime, so workers can't have them as
// pre-wired bindings — instead we talk to Cloudflare's D1 REST API with a
// scoped token. Every module worker that touches team data goes through this
// ONE file — which is also where sharding routing plugs in …
```

**Inline comments explain a decision, not the mechanics.** Good, it tells you *why the
line exists*:

```ts
// R17: a no-op repeat moves zero rows → no ping, no duplicate history.
const changed = await setBrandAssetActive(cfg, guard, actor, id, body.active)

// A missing item is skipped, not fatal — the rest of the batch still applies.
if (e instanceof GuardError && e.status === 404) { skipped++; continue }

// ?v= busts caches; the file itself is served immutable by the gateway.
```

**Guard the reader against a subtle danger.** From `internal-fields.ts`, above
`safeExternalLink`:

```ts
// Allow only safe link schemes (http / https / mailto). A `javascript:` / `data:` /
// `vbscript:` URL stored on a record is a stored-XSS payload the moment a reader
// clicks it. Anything unrecognised is dropped rather than refused — a link is
// optional, and losing a bad one costs nothing.
```

**A `housekeeping` classification always carries its reason** inline in `ROUTES`:

```ts
// Stores a file in R2 but changes NO record (no row to patch) → housekeeping.
"POST /api/content/brand-assets/upload": { handler: postUploadBrandAsset, kind: "housekeeping" },
```

Anti-patterns: a comment that restates the code (`// increment i`), a stale comment that
no longer matches the line, or a comment apologising for code that should just be
simpler. If a comment is needed to explain *what* the code does, prefer clearer code.

---

## 10 · Naming

Consistent, boring, predictable, the reader should be able to *guess* the name.

- **Route handlers** read as `METHOD` + verb + noun: `getBrandAssets`,
  `postCreateBrandAsset`, `postUpdateBrandAsset`, `postSetBrandAssetActive`,
  `postUploadBrandAsset`.
- **Lib CRUD** is the bare verb + noun: `listBrandAssets`, `countBrandAssets`,
  `createBrandAsset`, `updateBrandAsset`, `setBrandAssetActive`. Bulk siblings prefix
  `bulk` (`bulkSetStatus` in `lib/help.ts`).
- **Fetch-or-throw** helpers end in `OrThrow` (`assetOrThrow`, `ticketOrThrow`,
  `sourceOrThrow`) and throw a `404` `GuardError`.
- **Shaping functions** are `toX` (`toAsset`, `toActor`), one DB row → one shared type.
- **DB columns** are `snake_case` (`file_url`, `deactivated_at`, `creator_email`);
  **TS fields** are `camelCase` (`fileUrl`, `active`, `creatorName`). The `toX` function
  is the single translation point.
- **Error codes** are short `snake_case` strings, stable enough for the client to branch
  on: `not_member`, `forbidden`, `invalid_input`, `no_team`, `brand_asset_not_found`.
- **`GuardError` messages** are warm, plain, sentence case, safe to show a user, they
  follow the same voice as UI copy (see the glossary in `shared/glossary.ts`): *"You're
  not a member of this team."*, not *"403 FORBIDDEN: membership assertion failed"*.

---

## 11 · TypeScript config across workspaces

The repo is an npm workspace (`web`, `workers/*`) with **one tsconfig per workspace**,
there is no root `tsconfig.json`. The shared invariants (`workers/content/tsconfig.json`
is representative):

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022", "module": "ESNext", "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "strict": true,              // non-negotiable, everywhere
    "noEmit": true,              // tsc type-checks only; wrangler/next build
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "types": ["@cloudflare/workers-types"]
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.ts", "../../shared/**/*.ts"]
}
```

Notes:

- **`strict: true` is universal.** No `any` escape hatches; untrusted input is typed
  `unknown` and narrowed (that's what `validate.ts` does).
- **Each worker tsconfig `include`s `../../shared`** so the shared seams type-check in the
  *consuming* worker's context (the web tsconfig maps `@shared/*` → `../shared/*` and
  includes `../shared/**/*.ts` the same way).
- **Worker tsconfigs use `@cloudflare/workers-types`**; `web` uses the DOM libs + the
  Next plugin. Keep worker code free of DOM globals.

---

## 12 · How `npm run check` gates everything

One command is the gate. It must stay green before any commit, it is the difference
between "I think it works" and "the laws still hold".

```jsonc
// package.json
"lint":  "npx oxlint --deny-warnings"
"check": "npm run lint
        && npx tsc --noEmit -p web && npx tsc --noEmit -p web-portal
        && npx tsc --noEmit -p workers/auth && … && npx tsc --noEmit -p workers/portal-gateway
        && npm test"
```

`check` = **lint the whole repo**, then **type-check every workspace** (both front ends,
`web` and `web-portal`, and all eight workers, each against its own tsconfig), then
**run the full test suite** (`npm test` fans out across nine workspaces: every worker
that carries a suite, plus both front ends).

The lint goes first because it is the cheapest of the three, oxlint is a single binary
and covers the repo in about 15ms, against tsc's tens of seconds, and because the class
it catches is the one nothing else was catching. `.oxlintrc.json` sets `correctness` to
**error** and nothing else: it is a bug-finder, not a formatter. There is deliberately no
Prettier. The house style (no semicolons, the comment shapes in §1) is the existing code,
and a formatter would rewrite thousands of lines to enforce an opinion nobody asked for.

What it found on its first clean run is the argument for it: an `ErrorBoundary` imported
into `web/app/layout.tsx` and rendered nowhere, the containment half of the white-screen
guard that ERROR-HANDLING.md said was mounted, plus a `useMemo` carrying a dependency it
never read and eleven dead imports. `web/test/lint-gate.test.ts` keeps the step in the
gate, keeps findings fatal, and keeps the ignore list from quietly excluding the app.

The test suite is not just unit tests of behaviour, it includes the **law checks and
seam tests that read the source straight off disk**, so breaking a Law of the Base turns
the build red:

- **`workers/*/test/publish-seam.test.ts`** (Law R1), reads `ROUTES` and each handler's
  source, and fails if a `mutation` doesn't call a `publish*` helper, or if the
  `housekeeping` deny-list drifts from the reviewed set.
- **`workers/content/test/validate.test.ts`**, locks the boundary-validation contract
  (non-string / blank / over-long / NUL → clean 400) so the 500 bugs can't return.
- **`web/test/rules.test.ts`**, the UI + registry laws (record-detail tabs, `FormShell`,
  `TabsView`, one generic activity path, glossary well-formed, `registry-integrity`).
- **`web/test/doc-claims.test.ts`**, the docs against the roster on disk. It derives
  the worker list from `workers/` and reads each `wrangler.jsonc`'s own `workers_dev`
  flag to decide which are public, then fails if a doc states a worker count or a
  public-door count that disagrees. Not a Law (it governs prose, not code), but it is
  the answer to the same problem: "seven workers" and "one public door" stayed true in
  fourteen documents for two months after they stopped being true, because nothing
  read them. A genuine subset claim ("the six workers that bind the core DB") is a
  reviewed line in that file's `SUBSET_CLAIMS`, with its reason.

A law without a passing check is not a law, you cannot add one to `RULES.md` and the
registry without also adding its test (`registry-integrity` enforces the doc/registry/
check triangle stays in sync). See [RULES.md](../RULES.md).

### `npm run check:built`, the second gate, for what only a BUILD can be wrong about

`check` deliberately does not build: it has to be cheap enough to run before every
commit. But a few assertions can only be true of a **built** app — they read
`web/out/` and `web-portal/out/` and compare the shipped bytes against the source
strings — and those were written as `it.skipIf(!html)`, so on a fresh clone, and on
any machine that had not happened to build, **they skipped**. A skipped test and a
passing test print the same colour. The one guard covering a fault no other test in
this repo can see (the minifier fold above) was therefore also the one most likely to
be silently absent at the moment somebody asked whether it was green.

```jsonc
"check:built": "npm run build
             && REQUIRE_EXPORT=1 npm run test --workspace=kwapso-web
             && REQUIRE_EXPORT=1 npm run test --workspace=kwapso-portal-web"
```

Three things make it a gate rather than a wish:

1. **It builds first**, so the export exists by the time anything reads it.
2. **`REQUIRE_EXPORT=1` turns "no export" from a silence into a failure**, and the
   suite carries a tripwire asserting the file is there — a green run on a build that
   produced nothing would otherwise look identical to a green run on the right bytes.
3. **`deploy:staging` and `deploy:production` call it in place of `npm run build`**,
   so the export these bytes are read out of is the very one about to be uploaded, and
   it is listed under *Verify before shipping* in [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md), which
   is the list `/ship-staging` reads and runs. A gate nobody runs is not a gate.

It re-runs both front-door suites WHOLE rather than naming the test files that read
the export. That costs about ten seconds and buys the property that matters: a check
written next year against the built output is in this gate the day it is written,
because nothing has to remember to add it. A gate that enumerates from a hand-kept
list has a hole by construction — the same reasoning R2's record-detail census now
follows.

Beyond the automated gate, the **ship gate** (before `/ship-staging`) runs the quality
skills, `lean_mean` (≥ 92), `story_checks_out`, `security_sentry` (no critical/high).
This is where "too much code is a defect" is actually scored: a lean, well-reused diff
passes; a bloated one doesn't. Write the least code that obeys the laws, and both gates
stay green.

---

## The short version

Open with `gated` / `gatedBody` (`teamContext` → `requireRight` → the defensive body
read) → decide about a client login at the door → `requireText`/`optionalText`/
`queryText` every field → do CRUD in a `lib/` function through `d1Query` /
`d1ExecScript` + `sqlString` + `ulid`, stamping the audit block and deactivating instead
of deleting → `logActivity` → `publishChange` → `json` with the exact total. Throw
`GuardError` for every rule failure and let the one central catch format it. Comment
the *why*. Add the least code that does the job, and keep `npm run check` green.

## Reading config, and writing a check that can fail

Four conventions that look like trivia and are not, each one shipped as a real
defect first.

- **A CHECK THAT NEEDS EDITING WHENEVER SOMETHING ELSE CHANGES IS MATCHING THE
  WRONG THING.** The tell is that it needed the edit, not that the edit was hard.

  Earned three times in one session on 27 Aug 2026, by one strip. The knowledge
  base's writer keeps appending a list of its own sources under an answer, so the
  list is removed at the boundary. Version one matched a heading that BEGAN with a
  source phrase and measured 10/16 to 0/16 — then a prompt edit produced "This
  information comes from the sources:" and it walked past. Version two matched a
  heading that ENDED in one — then another prompt edit produced "The sources used
  to answer this question include:" and it walked past. Both times the fix was to
  add a phrase, and both times it held until the next prompt change.

  A phrase list is a guess about WORDING, and wording is the one thing that
  changes whenever anybody touches a prompt. The version that holds asks the
  question that cannot be reworded: **are the items in that block our own source
  titles?** A model listing the titles it was handed is signing off, whatever it
  calls the heading — and the strictness then lives in the items, which lets the
  heading match be almost anything, because "Sources:" over two steps of a process
  is refused by the items rather than by the heading.

  It is the same move as asking what a check would say if the thing it guards were
  deleted: stop matching the SHAPE somebody happened to write, and match the FACT
  you actually own. If a rule has to be updated every time an unrelated file
  changes, that coupling IS the bug report.

- **A SHIPPED STRING MUST NOT INTERPOLATE A COMPILE-TIME CONSTANT.** If a string
  reaches the browser as text the app writes itself, its literal is typed out, and
  any number a constant derives is asserted against the constant in a test —
  never spliced in with `${}`.

  ```ts
  const R = 435
  // NEVER, in a string that ships:
  const mark = `<circle r="${R}" fill="url(#ks-glow)" opacity="0"/>`
  // The literal, plus a test that the constants still derive it:
  const mark = `<circle r="435" fill="url(#ks-glow)" opacity="0"/>`
  ```

  Why: the production minifier (SWC, via `next build`) **constant-folds** a template
  literal whose substitutions are all compile-time constants, and folding the boot
  loader's mark once **dropped text** — `r="435" fill="url(#ks-glow)" opacity="0"/>`
  reached the browser as `r="435`, leaving three malformed tags in the middle of the
  opening frame of both front doors. The value was correct; the characters after it
  were gone.

  It is worth a convention rather than a bug report because **nothing in this repo's
  ordinary toolchain can see it**. Vitest compiles with oxc and folds nothing, so the
  source-level assertions all passed; TypeScript sees a well-typed string; the lint
  sees a string. Thirty-four green tests and a clean `npm run check` said the boot
  screen was fine. The only thing that catches it is reading the built export, which
  is what `npm run check:built` exists for — and the class is wider than the splash:
  any inlined SVG, `<style>` or `<script>` text assembled in TypeScript is exposed to
  it. `web/test/splash.test.ts` shows the pattern for the assertion that replaces the
  interpolation: the geometry is typed into the markup and DERIVED in the test, so the
  two cannot drift apart silently.

- **Numeric env vars go through `numberVar(env.X, DEFAULT)`** (`shared/workers/limits.ts`),
  never `Number(env.X) || DEFAULT` and never bare `Number(env.X)`. The two obvious
  spellings fail in opposite directions: `|| DEFAULT` turns a deliberate **0** into
  the default (set the AI allowance to zero, silently grant the full quota), and a
  bare `Number()` turns **unset** into 0 (a team cap that refuses every account its
  first team). Both are invisible until someone chooses the boundary value, which
  is exactly when it matters. `web/test/config-vars.test.ts` tests both boundaries
  and scans the workers so the raw spellings can't return.

- **A source-scanning check STRIPS COMMENTS before it matches, and matches a CALL,
  not a word.** This repo comments densely, and its comments discuss the very seams
  the checks scan ("no requireRight (it's about you)"). A handler's slice runs to
  the next top-level export, so it also swallows the doc comment introducing the
  NEXT function. Three consequences, all proven by sabotage:
  1. strip comments first, otherwise `// no LIMIT needed here` satisfies the very
     bound it describes the absence of, and prose thirty lines below stands in for
     a deleted gate;
  2. every alternative ends in `\s*\(`, a name is not a call;
  3. put a leading boundary `(?<![A-Za-z0-9_$.])` on each name, without it
     `ungatedBody(` matches a search for `gatedBody(` — and allow the generic
     between name and paren (`(?:<[^(<>]*>)?`), or `gatedBody<{…}>(` reads as a miss.

  And give every scan a **tripwire**: assert it matched something. A scan that
  silently finds nothing reports an empty offender list, which looks exactly like
  a pass.

- **WHEN A TEST DOUBLES SOMEBODY ELSE'S RUNTIME, THE DOUBLE HAS TO BE BUILT FROM
  WHAT THAT RUNTIME ACTUALLY RETURNS, NOT FROM THE INTERFACE WE WROTE FOR IT.**
  A stub written from our own type can only ever confirm us.

  Why: `/media/*` answered `content-range: bytes NaN-NaN/2810365` to every ranged
  read, of every shape, for as long as ranges had existed — under a four-case
  suite that passed. The stub echoed back the very object `byteRange` had just
  built, a clean union carrying only the keys we set, so every case was our own
  parser round-tripping through a mirror. **It could not have failed.** The door
  read R2's answer with `"suffix" in sent`, and `in` tests whether a KEY EXISTS,
  not whether it holds anything; the object R2 really returns carries all three
  keys with `undefined` values, so the suffix branch was taken every time and
  `size - undefined` is `NaN`.

  ```ts
  // The mirror: whatever we asked for is what we are told was sent.
  range: options?.range                      // ← can only agree with us
  // What the runtime measurably answers instead:
  range: { offset: undefined, length: undefined, suffix: undefined }
  ```

  Two things make it checkable by the next person rather than a story. **Identify
  the shape by reproducing the STRING**, not by picking the hypothesis that fits:
  the rival here (accessors on a prototype, which `in` also finds) reproduced
  three of the four request shapes and left the suffix case correct — three of
  four is what a wrong hypothesis looks like, and the request least expected to
  matter is the one that ruled it out. Then **prove the new double goes RED
  against the old code**, with the production string in the failure message; a
  stub that is merely more realistic is still unverified.

  And write the fix so it does not rest on the diagnosis. A diagnosis is a belief
  about somebody else's runtime, which is free to change: read fields as finite
  NUMBERS rather than by key presence, and put every plausible answer — the
  measured one, the union we used to assume, an empty object, nulls, garbage —
  through one request demanding the same true output from all of them
  (`workers/gateway/test/media-range.test.ts`). That case earned a rule nobody
  reasons their way to: an ask is a **ceiling** on what a report may claim was
  sent, because a player told there are more bytes than arrived stalls waiting
  for them and one told there are fewer throws away what it has.

- **A MEASUREMENT PROVES NOTHING UNTIL THE INSTRUMENT HAS BEEN SHOWN IT CAN
  FAIL.** Run the canary FIRST — a case that must come back positive and, where
  it is cheap, one that must come back negative. If the canary is silent the
  measurement is not evidence, however confident the number looks.

  This is not the same convention as the four above. Those are about writing a
  CHECK that can go red. This is about the ad-hoc measurement you take while
  investigating — the grep, the probe, the browser evaluate — which nobody
  reviews and which decides what you do next.

  Earned five times in one day, 29 Aug 2026, on one lane:

  · **A STALE CACHE.** `next build` reused a cached stylesheet, so a CSS fix
    read as "no effect". Reported to two other lanes as unfixable with the
    cause unknown. `rm -rf web/.next` flipped the answer. Clear the framework
    cache before believing a build.
  · **A HIDDEN TAB.** The Browser pane runs at `document.hidden === true`:
    `requestAnimationFrame` never fires and CSS animations never tick, so a
    Radix surface never receives the `animationend` it unmounts on. A known
    kit bug "reproduced" perfectly there — node still present 1.2s after a
    140ms animation, focus stranded — and was entirely an artefact. A PLAIN
    canary animation owing nothing to the component, stuck in the same tab
    with no events, is what caught it. Anything animation-driven must be
    measured somewhere that paints; Playwright does, the pane does not, and
    fronting the tab does not fix it.
  · **A TRUNCATED VALUE.** `boxShadow` sliced at 50 characters, and Tailwind's
    leading transparent placeholders filled all fifty — so a field carrying a
    perfectly good hairline read as edgeless, and nearly shipped as a bug
    report against the kit.
  · **THE WRONG ALGORITHM.** Accessible names computed from `textContent`,
    which is not the accessible-name algorithm: a button named by its image's
    `alt` looked nameless. Use the browser's own computation
    (`Accessibility.getFullAXTree` over CDP), not a hand-rolled approximation
    of a spec.
  · **A POLLUTED CANARY.** Having switched to the real computation, the probe
    INJECTED an unnamed button as its negative canary and then counted its own
    injection as the finding. A canary that changes the population it measures
    is a second bug wearing the first one's clothes.

  And a related one that is about identity rather than truth: **a count cannot
  name its source.** Grepping a built artefact for a real symbol tells you it
  is present, never which of N files put it there — so it cannot distinguish
  "my fix did nothing" from "my fix worked and a second source is still feeding
  it". Plant a SENTINEL instead: a unique token that could only have come from
  the file under suspicion, rebuild, and grep for the sentinel. One build per
  candidate answers it outright, and it is how root markdown was cleared and
  `shared/rules/registry.ts` convicted in two builds.

  The habit costs a minute per measurement. On the day above it caught five
  wrong answers, two of which had already been sent to other lanes.

  **AND THE CANARY HAS TO BE THE SHAPE OF THE REAL CASE, WHICH IS THE HALF
  THIS PARAGRAPH LEARNED AN HOUR AFTER IT WAS WRITTEN.** A canary proves the
  instrument sees the case the CANARY is, and nothing more. A probe hunting a
  same-tone box nested inside another walked four ancestors up, and its canary
  was a two-level nesting — so the canary passed, every run, while the real
  pairing sat FIVE levels apart and went straight through. That produced a
  clean bill of health for six screens, six portal routes and four
  compositions, all of it retracted.

  It is the more expensive direction. Every other failure listed above cost a
  wrong FINDING, which argues with the code and gets caught; this one cost a
  wrong ALL-CLEAR, which agrees with everybody and is never revisited. So
  build the canary out of the hardest instance you can imagine rather than the
  simplest one that demonstrates the idea, and when a probe carries a bound —
  a depth, a slice length, a result limit, a timeout — treat the bound as the
  first thing to distrust when it reports nothing.

## Scale + idempotency + filter patterns (R14 · R17 · R19)
These three are machine-checked; write them the house way so the build stays green.

- **Bounded reads, and PAGED growing ones (R14).** Every exported `list*`/`search*`
  in a worker `lib/` carries a HARD CAP from `shared/workers/limits.ts`.
  `LIST_HARD_CAP` (1000), `EXPORT_HARD_CAP` (10000), `THREAD_HARD_CAP` (500),
  with a `// R14 hard cap` comment. Never an unbounded `SELECT`; one unbounded
  read stalls a worker at 100k rows.

  But a cap is an honest *refusal* to answer, so a collection that GROWS with
  ordinary use must **page** instead. Growing collections are DATA
  (`GROWING_COLLECTIONS` in `shared/rules/registry.ts`); today: tickets, the
  knowledge base, accounts, process maps, work logs, meetings, stories, and the
  activity feed, the team-wide one and one record's slice of it registered
  separately, because "the server pages" and "the client can reach page two" are
  different facts. Read the real list in the registry; each entry says in plain
  words *why* that collection grows, and that sentence is the thing to argue with
  before you add one. Page by KEY, never by offset. `LIMIT ? OFFSET ?`
  re-scans everything it skips and duplicates or drops rows when someone writes
  mid-scroll:

  ```ts
  const after = keysetAfter(decodeCursor(cursor), "created_at")   // shared/workers/paging
  //  … WHERE <filters> AND (created_at < ? OR (created_at = ? AND id < ?))
  //    ORDER BY created_at DESC, id DESC LIMIT PAGE_SIZE + 1     // +1 reveals hasMore
  const page = toPage(rows, PAGE_SIZE, (r) => [r.created_at, r.id])
  return pagedJson("activity", { ...page, total })                // shared/workers/http
  ```

  Four things travel together and the check enforces all four: the rows, the
  EXACT total, `hasMore`, and an OPAQUE `nextCursor` the client hands straight
  back. Every response for that collection goes through `pagedJson`, a
  hand-built `json({ rows, total })` is how a door ships half the contract. A
  malformed cursor is a clean 400, never a silent restart at page one. On the
  client, `<LoadMore>` (`web/components/records/load-more.tsx`) appends the next page and
  is the only place the cursor is touched; a paged list's tabs must be SERVER
  scopes, because filtering a loaded page client-side disagrees with the exact
  count above it (R16).

- **Idempotent transitions (R17).** A deactivate/reactivate/status UPDATE carries
  the current-status predicate INLINE and reads the changed rows back:

  ```sql
  UPDATE brand_assets SET deactivated_at = ?, … WHERE id = ? AND deactivated_at IS NULL RETURNING id
  ```

  Return the boolean; when zero rows moved write NO activity row and (in the
  route) publish NO ping, a double-click writes one history row, not two. Keep
  the predicate *literally in the SQL string* (not hidden behind a variable) so
  the source-scan can see it. Bulk siblings count a no-op as `skipped`.

- **Filter parity (R19).** A GET agent/MCP tool on a list door must EXPOSE (schema
  property) and FORWARD (`buildQuery`) every param the door parses, the check
  derives the required set from the door's own `searchParams.get(...)`. If you add
  a `?filter=` to a door, add it to the tool the same commit.

- **The bulk cap is one constant, DERIVED from the reply ceiling.**
  `BULK_IDS_LIMIT` (`shared/workers/limits.ts`) is not hand-picked: it is
  `floor((AGENT_MAX_TOKENS - AGENT_REPLY_ENVELOPE_TOKENS) / TOKENS_PER_EMITTED_ID)`
 , what the model can physically emit in one turn. A cap the model is told but
  cannot write is a promise the runtime breaks silently, mid-JSON: the tool call
  truncates, the turn dies, nothing changed. It is enforced by the door AND
  declared in the tool schema (`maxItems`) + its description, and
  `workers/data-ops/test/reply-ceiling.test.ts` asserts the arithmetic still
  holds. Raise the ceiling and the cap follows; never edit them apart. For a
  set-shaped job prefer a FILTER tool (facets, `dryRun` counts first) over passing
  rows; never accept free text as a write filter.
