# PLATFORMS.md, where the base can run (Cloudflare recommended; eight others mapped)

The Kwapso System is **built for Cloudflare** and the `new-app` skill stands it up there end to
end (one prompt + a few credentials). But the base is deliberately built on **seams**,
a small set of swappable interfaces where it touches the platform, so it can be
*ported* to any major cloud. This doc is the honest, thorough map: what each pillar of
the base needs, which service on each of eight other providers backs it, and how big a
port really is.

> **The recommendation, plainly.** Use **Cloudflare**. It is the native stack: per-team
> databases (D1), the live layer (Durable Objects), the edge compute (Workers), and
> media (R2) are all first-party, and `new-app` wires them turnkey. Every other provider
> is a *port*, tractable (you swap seams, not the app), but real work. Pick another
> platform only when a hard constraint (an existing AWS estate, a data-residency rule, a
> team that only knows Azure) outweighs the turnkey path.

## 1 · The five pillars every platform must provide

The base leans on exactly five platform capabilities. Everything else is portable app
code. A port = back these five with the target platform's primitives.

| # | Pillar | What the Kwapso System uses (Cloudflare) | The one seam file to swap |
|---|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | **Per-team data isolation** | one **D1** (SQLite) database *per team* + one core D1 for global identity/billing | `shared/workers/d1-rest.ts` (`d1Query` / `d1ExecScript` / `d1QueryAcross` / `sqlString`) for TEAM data — plus 151 raw `env.DB.prepare(…)` sites in 27 files for the CORE database, which has no adapter (see below) |
| 2 | **The live layer** | the `TeamChannel` **Durable Object** fans out change pings | `shared/workers/realtime.ts` (`publishChange`), the ONLY broadcast seam |
| 3 | **Compute** | **8 Workers** behind two public gateways (one per front end) | each `workers/*` + the gateway router (the shape ports; the runtime swaps) |
| 4 | **File storage** | **R2**, keyed per team | the R2 `.put/.get` calls in `content` + `gateway` (`/media/*`) |
| 5 | **Static web** | TWO Next.js **static exports** (the agency app + the client portal), each served at the edge by its own gateway | none, a static bundle any host can serve |

Two more are **already provider-agnostic seams** (swap by config, no port):

- **Email**, one sender in `auth` (Resend today; any SMTP/API works). BOOTSTRAP §4.
- **The AI agent brain**. `AGENT_MODEL` var (a Workers AI model id, default
  `@cf/zai-org/glm-5.3-flash`; the Anthropic path was deleted 29 Aug 2026,
  else the keyless fallback). Point it at any provider's model.

**The multi-tenancy decision is the crux of any port.** Cloudflare gives cheap
database-per-team (D1). On a Postgres platform you choose one of: **row-level security
with a `team_id`** (recommended, one database, a policy per table), **schema-per-team**
(stronger isolation, heavier ops), or **database-per-team** (closest to the Kwapso System, most
expensive). The base's data door (`d1-rest.ts`) is where that choice lands, rewrite
that one seam and the 8 workers keep working unchanged.

**AND THAT SENTENCE IS TRUE OF TEAM DATA AND FALSE OF CORE DATA — measured
5 Sep 2026.** Pillar 1's row used to read "the ONLY place SQL runs", which is
exactly right for the per-team databases: every statement against them goes
through `d1Query` / `d1ExecScript`, and `web/test/rules.test.ts` holds it there.
The GLOBAL core database is reached a different way — `env.DB.prepare(…).bind(…)`,
Cloudflare's raw D1 binding API — at **151 call sites across 27 production files** —
auth, tenancy, content, data-ops and mcp — with no adapter of any kind between
them and the platform.

Nothing is wrong with those call sites; the binding is the fast path and it is
what core is bound through on purpose. What was wrong was the PRICE this file
quoted. A port that rewrote `d1-rest.ts` and expected the workers to keep working
would find identity, sessions, teams, memberships, invites, the error log, the
usage ledgers, the token desk and the sharding tables all still speaking D1
directly. Every effort band in §2 understates pillar 1 by that work — it is
mechanical rather than clever (one adapter, then a codemod over 151 sites), but
it is days, and it is days nobody had counted.

The count is derivable, so it can be re-checked rather than trusted:
`grep -rn "env\.DB\.prepare(" --include='*.ts' workers/ shared/ | grep -v test | wc -l`.

## 2 · The master map, the 5 pillars across eight other providers

Effort is for the *whole* port: **Turnkey** (a skill does it), **Moderate** (days),
**Heavy** (weeks, most primitives exist, the wiring is the work).

| Provider | Compute | Per-team data | Live layer | Storage | Static web | AI | Port effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Cloudflare** ⭐ | Workers | **D1** (DB/team) | **Durable Objects** | R2 | Workers static | Workers AI / Anthropic | **Turnkey** (`new-app`) |
| **Fly.io** | Machines (containers) | **LiteFS** (SQLite/team) or Fly Postgres | a WebSocket server on a Machine | Tigris (S3-API) | serve from app | any (Anthropic) | Moderate |
| **Netlify** | Netlify Functions | Neon / Supabase + RLS | Ably / Pusher | Netlify Blobs | **native (Next.js)** | any | Moderate |
| **Render** | Web Services (containers) | Render Postgres + RLS | a WebSocket service | Render Disks / S3 | Render Static | any | Moderate |
| **DigitalOcean** | App Platform / Functions | Managed Postgres + RLS | a WebSocket service | Spaces (S3-API) | App Platform static | any / DO GenAI | Moderate |
| **Supabase** | Edge Functions (Deno) | **Postgres + RLS** (native fit) | **Supabase Realtime** | Supabase Storage | host static elsewhere | any | Moderate–Heavy |
| **AWS** | Lambda / App Runner | Aurora/RDS Postgres + RLS (or DynamoDB) | API Gateway WebSockets / AppSync | S3 | CloudFront + S3 | Bedrock | Heavy |
| **Google Cloud** | Cloud Run | Cloud SQL Postgres + RLS (or Firestore) | Firestore streams / Pub/Sub + WS | Cloud Storage | Cloud CDN + bucket | Vertex AI | Heavy |
| **Azure** | Container Apps / Functions | Azure Postgres + RLS (or Cosmos DB) | **SignalR Service** | Blob Storage | Static Web Apps | Azure OpenAI | Heavy |

⭐ = recommended / native. Email on every row: Resend, or the provider's sender (SES,
Azure Communication Services, SendGrid on GCP, etc.), it's a config seam, not a port.

## 3 · How to actually port (the method, same for every provider)

Because the base is seam-isolated, a port is a **fixed, ordered checklist**, not a
rewrite. In rough effort order:

1. **Pick the tenancy model** (§1) and **rewrite the data door** (`d1-rest.ts`) to speak
   the target DB. Keep the function signatures (`d1Query`, `d1ExecScript`, `sqlString`,
   `d1QueryAcross`), the 8 workers call only these, so nothing above changes. For a
   Postgres+RLS port, `d1QueryAcross` (the shard fan-out) collapses to a normal query.
2. **Swap the live seam** (`realtime.ts` → `publishChange`) for the platform's realtime
   (SignalR, Supabase Realtime, Ably/Pusher, or a small WebSocket server). The payload
   contract is tiny and fixed: `{ resource, id, op }`, no row data crosses it.
3. **Swap the storage calls** (R2 → S3/GCS/Blob/Supabase Storage). Same per-team key
   prefixes; most targets speak the S3 API, so this is often a client swap only.
4. **Re-home the compute.** The 8 workers are small HTTP handlers; map each to the
   platform's function/container unit (or collapse several into one service on
   container platforms like Fly/Render/Cloud Run). Keep the **public-doors** rule,
   only the two gateways (one per front end) are public; the other six are
   private/internal, which is what keeps `/internal/*`, the agent and the act-as-user
   surface unreachable from outside.
5. **Serve the static web bundle** (`web/out`) from the platform's static host (native
   on Netlify; a bucket+CDN elsewhere).
6. **Point the config seams**: the email sender and `AGENT_MODEL`. No code.
7. **Re-run the gates**: `npm run check` (the app code is unchanged, so the Laws in
   RULES.md still hold), then the platform's own smoke.

**What never changes in a port:** the app logic, the 8-worker split, the permission
spine (`requireRight`), the Laws (RULES.md), the screen engine, the glossary, the agent.
That's the payoff of the seams, you rewrite ~4 files, not the product.

## 4 · Provider notes (the honest specifics)

**Cloudflare ⭐. Turnkey.** The native stack; `new-app` does the whole runbook
(BOOTSTRAP.md). Per-team D1 gives true database-per-tenant cheaply; Durable Objects give
a serverless live layer with no server to run. This is the reference, everything else
is measured against it.

**Fly.io. Moderate, closest port.** The only other stack that can keep the
**SQLite-database-per-team** model, via **LiteFS** (replicated SQLite). Run the workers
as one or a few Machines; the live layer is a small WebSocket process. If you love the
Kwapso System's data model but not Cloudflare, this is the shortest hop.

**Netlify. Moderate.** Next.js is native (the static export or full SSR). Bring
Neon/Supabase for the DB (RLS), Netlify Blobs for storage, and a realtime partner
(Ably/Pusher/Upstash) for the live seam. The 8 workers become Netlify Functions.

**Render / DigitalOcean. Moderate.** Container platforms: run the workers as
services, managed Postgres + RLS for tenancy, a WebSocket service for the live layer,
and S3-compatible storage (Spaces on DO). Straightforward, ops-simple, no edge.

**Supabase. Moderate–Heavy, natural data fit.** Postgres + **RLS** is the textbook
multi-tenant model, and **Supabase Realtime** maps cleanly onto the `publishChange`
seam. Compute is **Edge Functions** (Deno), the 8 workers port to Deno handlers.
Caveats: Supabase doesn't host a static SPA well (host `web/out` on Netlify), and
you'd likely adopt **Supabase Auth** in place of the custom email-OTP (a bigger change
than the other seams). Its own AI story is thin, point `AGENT_MODEL` at Anthropic.

**AWS. Heavy, enterprise-grade.** Every primitive exists: Lambda (or App Runner) for
compute, Aurora/RDS Postgres + RLS (or DynamoDB with a `team_id` partition key) for
tenancy, **API Gateway WebSockets** or **AppSync** for the live layer, S3 for storage,
CloudFront for the web, **Bedrock** for the agent (incl. Claude), SES for email. The
work is the wiring (IAM, VPC, deploy pipeline), not any missing capability.

**Google Cloud. Heavy.** Cloud Run for compute, Cloud SQL Postgres + RLS (or Firestore
with a tenant field) for tenancy, Firestore realtime or Pub/Sub-over-WebSocket for the
live layer, Cloud Storage for media, Cloud CDN for the web, **Vertex AI** for the agent
(Claude is available on Vertex). SendGrid for email.

**Azure. Heavy.** Container Apps / Functions for compute, Azure Database for Postgres +
RLS (or Cosmos DB) for tenancy, **SignalR Service** for the live layer (a clean fit for
`publishChange`), Blob Storage for media, Static Web Apps for the web, **Azure OpenAI**
or Anthropic for the agent, Azure Communication Services for email.

## 5 · The bottom line

- **Cloudflare is one prompt** (`new-app`), recommended, and the only turnkey path
  today.
- **Every other provider here is a real port**, but a *bounded* one: reimplement the
  five seams in §1 (mostly the data door + the live seam), re-home the compute, and the
  entire app. Laws, permission spine, screen engine, agent, runs unchanged.
- **The single biggest decision** on any non-Cloudflare port is the tenancy model
  (§1): database-per-team (native to the Kwapso System; keep it on Fly+LiteFS) vs. **Postgres + RLS**
  (the pragmatic default everywhere else).
- If you want a **turnkey** experience on another provider, that means building a
  `new-app`-equivalent for it (a skill per platform), a project in its own right. Until
  then, this doc + BOOTSTRAP.md (the Cloudflare runbook to mirror) are the map.

For the Cloudflare runbook itself, see **BOOTSTRAP.md**. For *why* the base is shaped
this way (and how each seam scales), see **BASE-MANUAL.md §6**.
