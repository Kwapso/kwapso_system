# BASE-IMPROVEMENTS.md, the honest backlog

The living list of known base issues and their status, from an **objective third-party
review** (2026-07-09): a fresh multi-agent `security_sentry` on this repo + an independent
four-audit pass (`lean_mean_check` · `security_sentry` · `error_analyst` · `story_checks_out`)
run against a *pristine* clone by the first real `new-app` fork (testco). Two reviewers with
no prior context converging on the same findings is the signal to trust.

Keep this current: when an item ships, move it to **Fixed** with the commit.

## Fixed (2026-08-04, final), four findings ported back FROM the downstream product

The fork shipped its side and sent four findings back. Three were live here too;
the fourth was a UX bug their seam tests caught that mine would have shipped.
387 tests.

| Sev | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| BLIND CHECK | **The gate scan read COMMENTS AS CODE.** Reproduced exactly: a mutation's real `requireRight(…)` was replaced with a comment mentioning it, and R10 stayed GREEN. This repo comments densely about the very seams being scanned, and a handler's slice runs to the next top-level export, so it swallows the next function's doc comment too. | All four gate scans (tenancy, content, data-ops, mcp) strip comments before matching, require `\s*\(` on every alternative, and allow the generic (`(?:<[^(<>]*>)?`) so `gatedBody<{…}>(` isn't a miss. |
| BLIND CHECK | **R14's LIMIT test read comments**, `// no LIMIT needed here` satisfied the very bound it describes the absence of. (The arrow-shape blindness and the saw-something tripwire were already fixed in the previous round.) | Comment-stripped before matching; proven with an unbounded read whose comment says LIMIT. |
| BUG | **A deliberate `0` in config silently became the default.** `Number(env.X) \|\| DEFAULT` at all three numeric env-var reads: `AGENT_FREE_DAILY=0` would have granted the full quota, and `MAX_TEAMS_PER_USER=0` the default 5. | One `numberVar()` parse, unset/empty/unparseable → fallback, every real number incl. zero honoured. Tested at both boundaries, plus a scan so the raw spellings can't return. |
| BUG | **The OTP cooldown counted CONSUMED codes**, so signing in on a laptop and then a phone made the second device wait a minute, the cooldown punished the one user who had already proved they own the inbox. | The probe carries `consumed_at IS NULL`. Their seam tests caught this; mine would have shipped it. |

Confirmed already correct here: the team cap counts `teams.creator_id` (not
memberships) and does **not** filter deactivated teams, "create five, switch them
off, repeat" would otherwise be an unbounded database generator wearing a cap.
Now locked by a test.

## Open (2026-08-19), what R28's widened walk found and did NOT fix

R28's definition of "a string a person reads" stopped being six hand-written folders
and became the two front doors' own import closure (`appFiles()`). Closing the
directory hole turned three other things up. None is a blind spot any more — every
one below was COUNTED by a derived census — and each is left open because the code
change is small and the **translations** are the lane.

| # | What | Size | Why not now |
|---|---|---|---|
| **I1** | **Fragment glue inside interpolated template literals.** 15 sites assemble a sentence out of `t()` pieces and values: `` `${t("Retire the")} ${r.label} ${t("rate?")}` ``, `` `${t("Does")} "${step.name}" ${t("still happen?")}` ``, `` `${roleless.length} ${t("processes have no role attached…")}` ``. A translator cannot move a fragment past a value that is not theirs to move, and German needs to. The fix per site is the one this lane used: ONE catalogue entry with `{holes}`. | 15 sites, 15 new entries | Merging a fragment into a whole sentence ORPHANS the fragment's existing machine translations, so each merged entry renders **English until all three are hand-written**: 45 translations. Doing the code without the words makes the app more English, not less. A law would arrive with a 15-line exemption list, which RULES.md already calls a list rather than a law. |
| **I2** | **Half-sentences as bare JSX text.** 13 sites where a paragraph interleaves prose with a value and the tail parses as `". Treat it like a password. It works for"` or `"'s own work. You can take it away again…"`. `isUserVisible` refuses these ON PURPOSE (`i18n-source.mjs` says why: a fragment with no subject cannot be machine-translated into anything), so they are copy REWRITES, not extraction bugs. Plus three pure glue words still on screen: `or` on the portal's sign-in, `of` and `…and` on the import screen. | 13 sites | Each needs a copy decision first and 28 translations after. The repo's own comment already names this as "a copy decision, not an extraction one". |
| **I3** | **`SAVINGS_CAPTION` ships in English in every language but one.** R25's sentence — *"The times in these steps are estimates we agreed with you. The subtraction is arithmetic."* — is the half of the savings feature that makes the number believable, and it reaches the screen as a **payload field** (`view.caption`) composed by a worker, with the constant in `shared/workers/savings.ts` as the fallback. So it escapes R28 for a PIPELINE reason, not a directory one: the walk now opens that file (a front door imports it) and finds nothing, because the string is a `const` declaration and not one of the seven positions. | 5 render sites, 1 worker | The right fix is the WORKER translating it from the caller's own language, which is the email/worker translator seam rather than the build-time catalogue — R25 and R30's territory, not R28's. Wrapping it at the render site would give it a catalogue key and silently disagree with R25's "word for word". |

Also noted, not a finding: `brand.description` ("Tailored digital operating systems for
mature businesses.") entered the catalogue when the walk widened. It is rendered in
Next's static `<meta>` at build time in one language, so it will sit at 0% coverage
until metadata is localised. Honest rather than wrong: the app does say it.

---

## Reasoned exceptions (decided, documented, NOT open findings)

Two things a review will flag every time. Both are deliberate positions with the
threat named, documented in BASE-MANUAL §5 (the fork chapter) and OPERATIONS.md
so a fork decides consciously rather than inheriting them by accident:

- **`/media/*` capability URLs**, no session check on uploaded files. An
  ex-member who saved a link keeps it, forever. Acceptable for product photos;
  **not** for invoices, IDs or personal data. Any fork storing those must fix it
  before launch.
- **Identity fields behind a neighbouring right**, stakeholder emails, the team
  creator's email, learning-progress user ids. Tenant-scoped throughout, so it is
  a wrong-right mismatch within one team, not a cross-customer leak.

---

## Fixed (2026-08-04, follow-up), the independent security review

Three no-prior-context auditors read a clean clone (no session notes, no prior
reports, no explanation of why anything was built) and refuted by default. Nine
findings survived; all nine are fixed below. 371 tests.

| Sev | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| HIGH | **Stored prompt injection reached UNCONFIRMED privilege grants.** Any member with `help:create` writes instructions into a 20,000-character ticket description; an admin later asks the assistant anything that lists tickets; `set_role_permissions` / `set_member_role` / `create_role` / `invite_member` then run AS the admin with no panel. | Those four now confirm. See EDGE-CASES §5 (this REVERSES the 2026-07-10 destructive-only decision, narrowly: every other constructive write still runs free). |
| MED | **`?scope=user` with no `id` returned the WHOLE team feed, unfiltered**, it matched no branch, leaving an empty WHERE. Exactly the leak R18 exists to stop, arrived at by omission; the source-scan stayed green because the clause still *existed*. | Fails closed at both layers (the route validates the scope and refuses an id-scope with no id; the reader returns nothing rather than widening), locked by `activity-scope.test.ts`, which RUNS the reader over every scope shape. |
| MED | **A role could grant ITSELF every right**, `member_roles:edit` + your own role id = admin in one call. | `setRolePermissions` refuses a self-grant, matching the sibling "you can't change your own role" invariant. |
| MED | **An unauthenticated request could write into the GLOBAL core DB**, the client-error beacon's gate was `Cookie.includes("session")`, a substring test on an attacker-controlled header, next to a comment claiming a drive-by couldn't fill the table. | The gateway resolves the session with auth before forwarding; a forged cookie now writes nothing (verified live on staging). |
| MED | **The daily AI allowance was advisory**, read-then-check, so N simultaneous chats all passed. | The cap rides the UPDATE, like the paid-credit path beside it. |
| MED | **The impersonation door shared a name with the maintenance key.** `ADMIN_KEY` is set on tenancy + data-ops in BOTH environments, so one mistyped `wrangler secret put` directory would have armed sign-in-as-anyone on production. | Its own `TEST_LOGIN_KEY` secret **and** a hard refusal when `ENVIRONMENT` is production, two independent locks, neither a runbook sentence. `ADMIN_KEY` deleted from staging auth. |
| LOW | **R10 claimed three gating-seam suites that did not exist** (tenancy, content, data-ops), a documented control, absent. | The three suites now exist and are sabotage-proven. (Writing them found a bug in my own scanner: no word boundary, so `ungatedBody(` matched `gatedBody(` and the check passed its own sabotage.) |
| LOW | **The email-change door was an enumeration oracle**, the "already in use?" check ran before the throttle, and a rejected probe counted toward nothing. | Throttle first; probes count. |
| LOW | **A double-clicked CSV import could write every row twice**, read-then-write, while CONCURRENCY.md claimed it was guarded. | The session is claimed atomically, like its batch sibling. |
| LOW | **Learning `body` + `contentLink` skipped the boundary seam**, a NUL byte was a 500, and the body had no length cap. | Both go through `optionalText` first, then the XSS scrub. |

# SECURITY ADVISORY, for apps forked from this base BEFORE 2026-08-04

A base that fixes a vulnerability silently leaves its own children exposed. Every
app forked before commit `5da1c76` carries the defects below in its own source,
the fork copied the code, and no deploy of this repo reaches it. **Six of these
have been independently confirmed live in a downstream product's production.**

Each entry gives the grep that finds it in a fork and the minimal patch. Run the
greps from the fork's root. **Every grep here was validated both ways**, it reads
clear against the fixed base and FLAGS the pre-fix base (`3bebf0b`), so a grep
that comes back clear is evidence, not an absence of evidence. The one caveat: if
you renamed the symbol it names, check that spot by hand.

## A1 · CRITICAL-if-agent-enabled, the assistant grants privileges with no confirmation
**Who is exposed:** any fork whose AI assistant is switched on and whose members
can write free text anyone else's assistant will read (a ticket, an article, an
imported row). **The attack:** a member writes instructions into a ticket
description; an admin later asks the assistant anything that lists tickets; the
model calls `set_role_permissions` / `set_member_role` / `create_role` /
`invite_member` as the admin, with no panel. Nothing in the audit log looks unusual.

```bash
grep -A 12 -E 'name: "(create_role|update_role|set_role_active|set_role_permissions|set_member_role|invite_member)"' shared/workers/tool-catalog.ts | grep -c "confirm: false"
```
Any count above `0` is vulnerable. (A plain `grep confirm: false` is NOT a test,
most tools legitimately don't confirm; only the privilege ones must.)
**Patch:** any tool whose `TOOL_GATES` entry starts `member_roles:` or
`team_members:` must declare `confirm: true`. Derive it rather than listing names,
copy `isPrivilegeWrite()` from `shared/workers/tool-catalog.ts` and the
`requiresConfirm` guard in `workers/data-ops/src/lib/tools.ts`.

## A2 · HIGH, the activity feed leaks every module's history
**The attack:** any member with `team_members:read` requests
`GET /api/tenancy/activity?scope=user` **with no `id`**. It matches no branch,
the WHERE comes out empty, and the whole team's cross-module history returns,
including before→after values from modules that member cannot read.

```bash
grep -cE '^\s*\} else if \(scope === "team"\)' workers/tenancy/src/lib/activity-read.ts
```
**Patch:** any count above `0` is vulnerable (the branch is conditional, so an
unresolved scope falls past it into an empty WHERE). Make it a plain `else`
so an unresolved scope still gets the visibility filter, return empty when a
non-team scope arrives without an `id`, and validate `scope` against the literal
set in the route instead of casting it.

## A3 · HIGH, a role can grant itself every right
**The attack:** a member holding `member_roles:edit` posts their OWN role id to
`/api/tenancy/roles/permissions` with every module true, and is an admin.

```bash
grep -n "export async function setRolePermissions" -A 12 workers/tenancy/src/lib/roles.ts | grep -c "guard.roleId"
```
**Patch:** returns `0` → vulnerable. Refuse when `roleId === guard.roleId`.

## A4 · MEDIUM, anyone can write to your global database
**The attack:** `curl -X POST <app>/api/log/client -H 'Cookie: session=x' -d
'{"message":"…"}'` in a loop. The gate is a substring test on an
attacker-controlled header, so unauthenticated rows accumulate in the core
database that also holds users, sessions and teams, toward D1's 10 GB cap.

```bash
grep -n 'includes("session")' workers/gateway/src/index.ts
```
**Patch:** any hit is vulnerable. Resolve the session first,
`env.AUTH.fetch("https://internal/api/auth/me", { headers: { Cookie: cookie } })`,
and drop the beacon when it isn't ok.

## A5 · MEDIUM, one mistyped directory arms sign-in-as-anyone
**Why it matters:** if the test-login door is gated by `ADMIN_KEY`, it shares its
name with the maintenance key your runbook tells operators to set on tenancy and
data-ops **in both environments**. One `wrangler secret put ADMIN_KEY` run in the
wrong directory turns a maintenance key into universal impersonation on production.

```bash
grep -n "env.ADMIN_KEY" workers/auth/src/index.ts
```
**Patch:** any hit is vulnerable. Give the door its own `TEST_LOGIN_KEY` secret,
add `if (env.ENVIRONMENT === "production") return fail(403, …)`, and set
`"ENVIRONMENT"` in `workers/auth/wrangler.jsonc` vars for every environment.

## A6 · MEDIUM, the daily AI allowance is advisory
**The attack:** fire N chat requests at once; every one reads `used < cap` before
any writes, so all N proceed. The free allowance overruns by the burst width and
paid credits are never reached.

```bash
grep -c "agent_usage.used <" shared/workers/credits.ts
```
**Patch:** a count of `0` is vulnerable, the cap isn't in the write.
(Don't grep for `SELECT used FROM agent_usage`: a legitimate read of the same
row backs the quota display.) Put the cap in the write.
`INSERT … ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE SET used = used + 1 WHERE agent_usage.used < ?`,
and proceed only when a row changed.

## A7 · MEDIUM, an uncapped database-creation door
**The attack:** sign up, then POST `/api/tenancy/teams` in a loop. Every call
provisions a real D1 database until the Cloudflare account's quota is gone. No
permission is exceeded; the platform simply stops working.

```bash
grep -n "creator_id = ?" workers/tenancy/src/routes/team.ts
```
**Patch:** returns nothing → vulnerable. Count teams the caller CREATED and
refuse at a cap (`MAX_TEAMS_PER_USER`, default 5, overridable per environment).

## A8 · LOW, an unthrottled user-enumeration oracle
**The attack:** any signed-in account POSTs `/api/auth/email/change/start` in a
loop; `409 email_taken` vs `{}` reveals whether any address has an account, at
full request rate. The login door is deliberately non-enumerable; this undoes it.

```bash
grep -n "export async function startEmailChange" -A 25 workers/auth/src/lib/email-change.ts | grep -c "findUserByEmail"
```
**Patch:** any count above `0` is vulnerable, the START door answers "does this
address exist?" before the throttle. Move the check to the VERIFY step (where the
caller has already proved they control the new inbox) and keep the UNIQUE
constraint as the backstop.

## A9 · LOW, anyone can lock a real person out of sign-in
**The attack:** request five codes for someone else's address. For the rest of
the hour their own sign-in returns `429`. (This one bit a real operator on their
own staging, self-inflicted, by retrying.)

```bash
grep -n "Try again in an hour" workers/auth/src/lib/login-codes.ts
```
**Patch:** any hit is vulnerable. Throttle the SEND with a short cooldown
(~60s); past the hourly cap, ROTATE the live code row in place instead of
refusing, codes are hashed at rest, so rotation (a fresh secret, fresh TTL,
`attempts = 0`) is the only way to let the inbox owner back in.

## A10 · LOW, a double-clicked import writes every row twice
```bash
grep -n "import_complete === 1" -A 6 workers/data-ops/src/lib/import.ts | grep -c "import_initiated = 1 WHERE"
```
**Patch:** returns `0` → the check is read-then-write. Claim the session in one
statement (`UPDATE … WHERE id = ? AND import_complete = 0 AND import_initiated = 0
RETURNING id`), placed BELOW every validation, and release it on failure.

## A11 · LOW, a NUL byte is a 500
```bash
grep -n "safeBody(input.body)" workers/content/src/lib/learning.ts
```
**Patch:** any hit is vulnerable. Wrap with the boundary seam first,
`safeBody(optionalText(input.body, "Body", TEXT_LIMITS.long))`, and the same for
`contentLink`.

## A12 · LOW, a deliberate `0` in config silently becomes the default
**The shape:** `Number(env.X) || DEFAULT`. Set the AI allowance to `0` to switch
free usage off and you silently grant the full daily quota; the mirror shape,
bare `Number(env.X)`, turns *unset* into `0`, a cap that refuses everyone.

```bash
grep -rnE "(?:Number|parseInt|parseFloat)\s*\(\s*env\." --include="*.ts" workers/ shared/ \
  | grep -v node_modules | grep -vE ":[0-9]+: *(\*|//)"
```
**Patch:** any hit is vulnerable (the second `grep -v` drops doc comments that
DESCRIBE the bad shape, including the one in the patched file itself). Route them
all through one parse that treats
unset/empty/unparseable as the fallback and honours every real number including
zero, copy `numberVar` from `shared/workers/limits.ts`, and test at `0` and `""`.

## And the two blind CHECKS, which matter as much
A fork also inherits the checks. Two flaw classes made several of them unable to
fail, a green check that cannot go red is worse than no check, because it is
reported as a pass:

```bash
grep -L "stripComments" workers/*/test/gating-seam.test.ts web/test/rules.test.ts
```
**Patch:** every file listed reads COMMENTS AS CODE. This is the worst of the
three, because this repo comments densely about the very seams being scanned and
a handler's slice runs to the next top-level export, so it swallows the doc
comment introducing the next function. A gate deleted from a handler stayed green,
satisfied by prose thirty lines below. Three fixes together:
1. **strip comments** before matching (block comments, then line comments whose
   `//` isn't part of a `https://`);
2. **match a CALL, not a word**, every alternative ends `\s*\(`, and allow the
   generic between name and paren (`(?:<[^(<>]*>)?`) or `gatedBody<{…}>(` reads
   as a miss;
3. **boundary every identifier**, `(?<![A-Za-z0-9_$.])`, without which
   `ungatedBody(` satisfies a search for `gatedBody(`.

Then teach every source-scan BOTH export shapes (`export function listX` and
`export const listX = async (…) =>`) and give it a **tripwire** asserting it
matched something, a scan that silently finds nothing returns an empty offender
list, which reads exactly like a pass. See `web/test/hooks-order.test.ts` for the
fixture pattern that locks a scanner's own blind spots.

---

## Fixed (2026-08-04, follow-up), the five close-out items

The hardening round's own review found five loose ends. 354 tests (up from 342).

| Sev | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| SCALE | **A hard cap is an honest refusal, not an answer.** R14 capped growing collections at 1,000 rows and called cursor paging a "next step"; a downstream product had already shipped keyset paging on its growing collections and proved it at 24,000 rows. | R14 WIDENED: a collection that grows with ordinary use must PAGE by key, `shared/workers/paging.ts` (opaque cursor, id tiebreak, `LIMIT+1` for `hasMore`) answered through the one `pagedJson` seam. Support tickets + the team activity feed page end to end; the My/All tabs became SERVER scopes (a client filter over a page disagrees with its exact badge). `GROWING_COLLECTIONS` is registry DATA; the check asserts the lib seam, the response, and that the client can reach page two. |
| BUG | **The agent was told a bulk cap it could not physically write.** The reply ceiling was 4,096 tokens while the declared cap was 500 ids (~8,000 tokens), the tool call truncates mid-JSON, the turn dies, nothing changed, no error. | `AGENT_MAX_TOKENS` raised to 8,192 and `BULK_IDS_LIMIT` DERIVED from it (512). `reply-ceiling.test.ts` asserts the arithmetic and that every bulk schema declares the derived number. |
| BUG | **The hooks-order scanner had a third blind spot**: a guard written the ordinary way (`if (!ready) {` newline `return null` newline `}`) put its return at brace depth 2, so it never registered as an early return, switching the white-screen check OFF for that whole file. | Rewritten around the real semantic: a return counts unless it is inside a NESTED FUNCTION. Arrow components are scanned too, and fixtures now lock the scanner's own blind spots (a check that cannot fail is not a check). |
| BUG | **The dropdown-ordering rule was stated but not locked**, nothing stopped either surface losing it. | The rule is pinned as `DROPDOWN_ORDER_RULE` and asserted on BOTH surfaces the model reads (the tool description and the system rule wall), including that CREATE is the step named first (R9's vocabulary half). |
| OPS | **Staging's smoke was red (16/18)** on a stale team-database pointer, indistinguishable, to the next reader, from a real regression. | Staging reset (3 of 4 team-DB pointers were dangling), re-deployed, smoke back to **18/18**. |

---

## Fixed (2026-08-04), the base hardening round (7 new laws + security/UI)

Ported the twenty defects a downstream product (Acrymold) found under real load,
each was a base defect. Seven became machine-checked Laws (R13–R19), each
sabotage-proven; the rest are security/agent/UI fixes. 342 tests (up from 302).

| Sev | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| DESIGN | **A capability shipped in code was invisible until a catalogue ROW existed**, staging could import modules production (byte-identical code) could not. | R13 widened: the import catalogue reconciles itself against the code on READ (INSERT-only; an owner's OFF stays off; the picker filters is_active in memory). Shipping the code now ships the capability. (`catalog-coverage`) |
| SCALE | **Unbounded list reads** would stall a worker at 100k rows. | R14: every `list*`/`search*` carries a hard cap from `shared/workers/limits.ts` with its comment (`bounded-lists`). *Widened in the follow-up round above: a GROWING collection must page, not cap.* |
| BUG | **Deaf publishers / stale paged screens**, a worker pinged `selectable_data` and nothing listened; paged rows live outside the row caches. | R15: the live registry (`web/lib/live-resources.ts`) + a ping bus + `useLiveRefetch`; every published resource reaches a listener or a reasoned `DEAF_EXEMPT`. (`live-collections`) |
| BUG | **A 24,011-row catalogue advertised "1000"** (a capped list's length) and the same count showed twice on one screen. | R16: exact server COUNT(*) through the one `formatCount` seam; tab-vs-heading arbitration by React context. (`counted-collections`) |
| BUG | **A double-clicked Deactivate wrote two history rows** 2s apart. | R17: the current-status predicate rides the UPDATE; zero rows moved = no activity, no ping. (`idempotent-transitions`) |
| LEAK | **The team activity feed showed every module's before/after behind one gate.** | R18: it subtracts the caller's denied modules through one clause; every relatedTable resolves through `ACTIVITY_GATE_MAP` or a pinned exemption. (`activity-gate-coverage`) |
| BUG | **The agent answered a DIFFERENT question**, free-text fallback matched 3,465 mentions instead of 134 records. | R19: every list tool exposes + forwards its door's filters, derived from the door's own source. (`agent-filter-parity`) |
| SEC | **Login codes echoed in API responses + a toast** on staging. | B1: echo + var DELETED (inbox-only, every env); ADMIN_KEY-gated staging test-login door mints a normal code for tests. |
| SEC | **Internal doors waved callers through** when `INTERNAL_KEY` was unset. | B2: send-email / log-error / mcp-session all FAIL CLOSED. |
| SEC | **The 5-try attempt cap was burstable** (read-then-write). | B3: one atomic UPDATE checks + consumes a slot (login + email-change). |
| SEC | **Preview URLs were a second public door.** | B4: `preview_urls: false` beside `workers_dev: false` on every non-gateway worker. |
| CRASH | **A hook below an early return white-screened the app** (React #310), and the ErrorBoundary was never mounted. | C1: the boundary is mounted at the root; `hooks-order.test.ts` makes the class unshippable. |
| AGENT | **Bulk tool JSON truncated mid-call** (1024 max_tokens); no set-shaped tool. | C2: `AGENT_MAX_TOKENS` 4096 *(superseded. See the follow-up round above: 8,192, with the bulk cap derived from it)*; a filter-shaped `set_help_status_by_filter` (dry-run counts first, idempotent); the bulk cap is one declared constant; dropdown-never-invents rule. |
| BUG | **The usage log showed an admin four blank rows** with a teammate's name. | C3: `agent_usage_log.kind` (0014), action rows team-visible, prompt rows the author's; the fold APPENDS its actions, never replaces. |
| UI | **Action rows clipped off the left edge**; the brand mark lost its corners. | C4/C5: flex-wrap + ml-auto; object-contain at `LOGO_SAFE_RATIO` 0.76. |

Also this round: R10 widened with an mcp gating-seam suite (identity-gated writes); every exemption is DATA in the rules registry (B5). Core migration **0014** (`agent_usage_log.kind`) applies before deploy.

## Fixed (2026-07-13), the invite + credit-fairness round (team testing on staging)

Three real bugs a teammate (chilavert) hit exercising the AI co-pilot's invite flow.
(A fourth report, "chat creates a role but also opens an empty form", was already fixed
by the one-shell round; re-verified live, no change needed.)

| Sev | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| MED | **Agent accepted a self / existing-member invite**, asked "which role?" and only failed at the door, wasting a turn (and credits). No explicit self-invite guard existed (blocked only transitively via already-member). | Added a `self_invite` guard in `createInvite` (clear "you can't invite yourself" message) + system-prompt guidance so the agent checks membership and refuses UPFRONT. Verified live: it now says "that's your own email, you're already on the team." (`workers/tenancy/src/lib/invites.ts`, `agent.ts` SYSTEM; `integration.test.ts`) |
| MED | **Dishonest email narration**, the invite email was fire-and-forget, and the agent's "no email was sent" line was free model text, not bound to the real outcome; a *successful* invite mis-narrated as a duplicate would send an email while the bot claimed it hadn't. | `createInvite` now AWAITS the send and returns `emailSent`; the route returns it (first); the agent is told to report it honestly and never claim an email was sent when it wasn't. The invite still succeeds if mail fails (the invite_index row routes acceptance; accept in-app). (`invites.ts`, `routes/invites.ts`, `tool-catalog.ts`, `agent.ts`; `integration.test.ts`) |
| MED | **Charged for refused actions + mislabeled**, a turn that only asked a clarifying question or hit a refused action still cost credits and was titled by the read it ran ("List roles"), not what the user did. | A turn that changed NOTHING (a refused action or a model hiccup) now REFUNDS its metered units (`refundAiUnits` reverses both pools), a blocked action costs 0. Usage rows title by WRITES only, so a read-only clarify turn reads as the question. Verified live in the credit log (a failed invite → **0 credits**). (`credits.ts`, `agent.ts`; `credit-reconcile.test.ts`) **NARROWED 2026-08-11**, the refused-action half of this refund was itself the hole: that failure is reachable on demand, so the credit lane became unbounded (the free allowance was already protected from exactly this, in a comment one line above the code that did it). A unit is spent the moment the model answers; only a model call that THREW is refunded now. See DATA-MODEL.md `agent_usage`. |

## Fixed (2026-07-10), the unification + one-shell round

The two big structural moves the owner asked for after the hardening round.

| Sev | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| P1 #2 | **Two tool catalogs drift.** The agent (data-ops) + MCP each hand-declared the same ~two dozen tenancy/content endpoints, so a capability had to be added twice and they could diverge (the drift the owner hit adding list_invites). | Collapsed the 24 overlapping endpoints into ONE `shared/workers/tool-catalog.ts` (SHARED_TOOLS); each surface PROJECTS them (`toAgentTool` / `toMcpTool`) + adds its surface-only tools. `mcpName` preserves the 3 external MCP names. Bonus: the agent gained `list_dropdown_values` (a parity gap). Adding a CRUD tool is now one edit. |
| P1 (new) | **Navigating into a team screen HARD-RELOADED** (static-export boundary), tearing down the SPA + a running agent; the agent's screen-trace couldn't drive across it. | The **whole post-auth app is now ONE shell**, `/home`, `/settings`, `/invitations` render `<DeepLinkScreen/>` like `/t`, `/learning`, `/tickets`; all in-app nav is soft History-API (`softNavigate` / `go()`), no reload anywhere. Only pre-auth (`/login`, `/onboarding`) is a real navigation. The trace now soft-drives from any screen (EDGE-CASES §1). |

## Fixed (2026-07-10), the agent hardening round (team testing on staging)

A sweep of real bugs surfaced by the team exercising the AI co-pilot on staging.

| Sev | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| HIGH | **Agent panel died when the trace entered `/t`**, the off-host screen-trace `router.push`ed into a deep `/t` path, a hard reload (static export) that tore down the running agent + its live steps | The co-pilot is mounted once at the ROOT (`agent-host.tsx`) + its open state mirrors to `sessionStorage` (survives a real refresh; `agent-host.test.ts`). Trace first NARRATED off-host, then **superseded by the one-shell round (above): with no reload boundary left, the trace soft-drives from anywhere** (EDGE-CASES §1). |
| HIGH | **First-turn confirm buttons dead**, a brand-new chat's first dangerous action paused at a confirm whose Go-ahead/Not-now no-op'd (the event omitted `threadId`) | `threadId` added to the `confirm` stream event; client adopts it (EDGE-CASES §6; `stream.test.ts`) |
| MED | **Credit history didn't reconcile**, a confirmed command split into a row + a cryptic "(continued)" row, so it didn't sum to the balance | The confirm turn FOLDS its units into the command's one row; rows are titled by the ACTION taken, not the prompt (DATA-MODEL; `credit-reconcile.test.ts`) |
| MED | **Screen-trace opened a blank input form** and left it open after the record already existed | Trace lands on the RESULT (detail/list), never a dialog; `TraceTarget` has no query field by construction (`trace-parity.test.ts`) |
| MED | **Agent over-confirmed**, it asked before ordinary building (create a role, invite) | Confirm relaxed to **destructive-only** (removals + deactivations + bulk); constructive writes run free (EDGE-CASES §5) |
| MED | **Agent couldn't revoke an invite by email**, `revoke_invite` needs an id but there was no way to list pending invites | Added a `list_invites` read tool to the agent + MCP catalogs (`agent.test.ts`) |
| LOW | **Launcher needed a reload on first login**, the root host mounts before login and its non-reactive session copy never updated | `useActiveTeam` session cache made reactive (pub-sub); the launcher appears the instant you sign in (`agent-host.test.ts`) |
| LOW | **"Blank pills"**, empty tool-only assistant turns painted as empty bubbles on resume | `toChatItems` drops blank-content assistant turns (kept server-side for replay) |

## Fixed (2026-07-09)

| Sev | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| HIGH | Agent could make privilege/identity writes (rename team, change roles, set permissions, invite) with **no confirmation**, reproduced live (a read-only question silently renamed a team) | `confirm: true` on the 7 privilege/identity tools; `agent.test.ts` flipped to the safe contract (`workers/data-ops/src/lib/tools.ts`). **Superseded 2026-07-10:** by owner decision the confirm rule was relaxed to **destructive-only** (removals + deactivations + bulk); the privilege-confirm defense-in-depth was traded for a smoother agent, the fence (untrusted content as DATA) + act-as-user gating + audit remain the primary defenses. See EDGE-CASES §5. |
| HIGH | **Stored XSS**: `parseUploadDataUrl` accepted any MIME (`text/html`, `svg`); gateway served `/media/learning/*` back with it on the app origin (worker-built response, so `_headers` didn't apply) → attacker JS rides a viewer's session, cross-team | Allow-listed inline-safe MIME at the boundary + `mediaHeaders()` adds `CSP: default-src 'none'; sandbox` + `nosniff` on both gateway media branches (`shared/workers/image.ts`, `workers/gateway/src/index.ts`) |
| MEDIUM | AI usage-log returned **every member's raw prompt** to any teammate who opened it | `readUsageLog` redacts the summary to the viewer's own rows (`shared/workers/credits.ts`, moved there 2026-08-18 when a second worker started spending the allowance) |
| MEDIUM | No anti-clickjacking / MIME / referrer headers served | `X-Frame-Options: DENY` + `nosniff` + `Referrer-Policy` in `web/public/_headers` |
| LOW | Boundary validation gaps: role `description`, team `name`, member/invite ids not type-checked → a non-string body was a **500, not a 400** | `optionalText` / `requireText` / `typeof` guards (tenancy routes) |
| CRIT (forks) | `mcp` binds the core DB but docs said "**five** core-bound workers" → a fork on a shared account silently binds mcp to the ORIGINAL core DB (cross-tenant) | "SIX core-bound workers" everywhere (BOOTSTRAP, OPERATIONS, new-app); OPERATIONS now lists migration 0013 + mcp in the `INTERNAL_KEY` set |
|, | Fork sweep left `kwapso.kwapso.workers.dev` host URLs in the MCP docs | new-app sweep now treats host URLs as live references, not history |

## Open, ranked (the "three moves that each kill several findings" first)

### P1 · resilience + leanness, high leverage, real refactors
1. **One `callInternal(path, {cookie, timeout})` seam** (`shared/workers/`). Kills THREE findings at once: the cookie-forward internal-fetch dance is copy-pasted 5+ times (DRY), **no `fetch` has an `AbortSignal`** anywhere, the D1 REST door (`cf()`), cross-worker calls, and the agent's model calls all lack a timeout, so one hung socket stalls a whole worker (resilience), and the forward executors flatten 403/409/500 into one generic string (status preservation; also the cause of the agent's "stuck pending step"). **Highest-leverage single change.**
2. ~~**Unify the two tool catalogs.**~~ **DONE 2026-07-10**, one `shared/workers/tool-catalog.ts` both surfaces project from (see Fixed above).
3. **Idempotency + partial-failure cleanup on the fleet writes.** `import-confirm` has no idempotency (retry → duplicate rows); `migrateTeams` aborts the whole fleet on the first bad team and leaves schema drift; the module-mover can orphan a DB / double-count on interruption. Add an idempotency guard + per-item try/catch + cleanup.
4. **Close the two error-log blind spots.** The nightly cron catch and the agent model-call catch swallow unexpected errors (console-only / nothing), invisible in the 90-day `error_logs` table meant to catch exactly those. Add `recordWorkerError` in both.
5. **`d1QueryAcross` uses `Promise.all`** → one slow/failed shard fails an entire split-module read. Use `allSettled` + record the degraded shard.

### P2 · deploy + docs
6. **realtime↔auth cold-start cut.** A genuinely fresh-account first deploy dies `code 10143` (realtime binds auth, auth binds realtime). Document the one-time binding cut as a first-class BOOTSTRAP step AND make `deploy:*` tolerate it, not the current footnote ("in practice auth already exists", false for `new-app`).
7. ~~**`DEV_ECHO_CODES=1` on staging** echoes login codes in API responses.~~ **DONE 2026-08-04**, the echo (code path + config var) is DELETED, code appears inbox-only in every env; automated sign-in uses the ADMIN_KEY-gated staging test-login door (B1, see Fixed below).

### P3 · structure / honesty
8. **Eight god-files >400 LOC** (`agent.ts` ~570, both `tools.ts`, `api.ts` ~535…). Split by seam. Largely dissolved by #1 + #2.
9. **Reconcile the lean score.** A fresh honest `lean_mean_check` scores **~84–90 (B/A-)**, not the committed report's 93, the leanness dimension (~73) is dragged by #1 + #2 + the god-files. Either land #1/#2 (which genuinely raises it) or regenerate the report honestly. Don't ship an over-stated score.

## CLOSED, the Google connector layer (the knowledge base's other half)

> **This whole section is HISTORY as of 2026-08-18.** The connector layer shipped
> on 12 August (per-person OAuth, `google_connections`, the Drive / Gmail /
> Calendar / Chat sources) and everything below describes the world before it. Two
> things it predicted are now settled differently and are worth reading against
> the note: the six sources are built, and **Calendar is NOT two-way** — the owner
> retired the write half on 18 August, so the calendar is read-only and the "two-way
> write half… deserves its own design" paragraph at the end of this section

The knowledge base shipped on 2026-08-11 reading the app's OWN rows, tickets and
their conversations, learning articles, accounts. `.plans/BUILD-2-knowledge-base.md`
§3 also asks for six Google sources (Calendar, Drive folders, Drive files,
Gmail threads, Chat spaces, Meet transcripts). Those were NOT built when this was
written, and this is the note that said so out loud.

**Why not.** There are no Google credentials in this environment and nothing that
could be verified against Google's APIs, so it would be a few thousand lines that
no test in this repo can run. "Too much code is a defect" cuts hardest on code that
cannot be proved. The brief's own sequence agrees: §3 puts the in-app sources first
precisely because "they are how you prove retrieval works", and §7 puts the
connector layer at step 6, after the screens and the agent's tools.

**Where it plugs in, so this is a seam and not a rewrite.**

- `INGEST_KINDS` in `workers/content/src/lib/knowledge-ingest.ts` is DATA: a kind
  is `{ kind, table, label, read(cfg, guard, cursor, limit) }`. A Google source is
  one more entry whose `read` calls Google instead of D1 and returns the same
  `IngestRow[]`. Everything around it, the resumable cursor, the bounded slice,
  the content-hash skip, the failure recording (R12), the compartment derivation,
  the "an excluded source is never put back" rule, is written once and inherited.
- `knowledge_sources.owner_user_id` is already the fence the TWO CONNECTION LAYERS
  need: NULL = what the organisation can see (a service account), a value = what
  one member can see (their own OAuth). Retrieval already ANDs it, and
  `workers/content/test/knowledge.test.ts` already proves a colleague cannot read
  somebody's personal material out of an answer.
- The sweep already runs on a 15-minute cron, which is exactly the backstop §3
  asks for beside push where Google supports it.

**What it still needs, and none of it is code we can write blind:** a Google Cloud
project with the six scopes, an OAuth client for the personal layer, a service
account with domain-wide delegation for the organisation layer, a `knowledge_connections`
table (per team: kind, owner, refresh token, scopes, status, last error), token
refresh with R11 timeouts, and, for Calendar, the two-way write half, which is
the only one of the six that is not just ingestion and deserves its own design.
*(That last clause is the one the 18 August ruling reversed: the write half WAS
built and has been removed. The calendar is ingestion and nothing else.)*
Note that `workers/auth/src/lib/google.ts` (Google SIGN-IN, landed 2026-08-11)
already establishes a Google client in this project; the data scopes are a
different consent screen, but not a different account.

## NOTE, the bulk-triage flow, and whose door the last piece is

`.plans/BUILD-2-knowledge-base.md` §2 names two flows as the acceptance test.
Both are reachable TODAY with the tools that shipped, and the confirm panel
already does the part that sounded like it needed building:

**"Triage everything that came in this week."** `list_help_tickets` → then, per
client, `ask_knowledge` with that account's id (so the compartment is the
client's own material plus the agency's) → then the per-ticket writes. The panel
is ONE panel for the whole batch already: `runTurn` surfaces **all** of a turn's
calls through the one `pendingCall` seam ("so a mixed turn doesn't silently drop
its non-confirm calls"), each carrying the summary AND the body the door will
receive. So twenty proposed triage writes are twenty rows in one yes/no, which is
exactly what the brief asks for, with no bulk-triage door at all.

**What was deliberately NOT built here:** a `POST /api/content/help/bulk-triage`
door taking `[{id, helpType, status}]`. It would be tidier than N calls, and it
belongs to the WORK ENGINE's lane, not this one. That lane owns the ticket
lifecycle (`new → triaged → in progress → ready → resolved`), the first-staff-
touch lock, the per-account reference and the drag-rank, and it is mid-flight in
the same two files. A second definition of "triaged", written from the outside,
is precisely the kind of parallel world CLAUDE.md exists to prevent. When that
lane lands its own batch door, the assistant gets it for free: it is one entry in
the shared tool catalogue.

**"Stories from a transcript"** cannot be finished by anyone yet: there is no
`stories` table. The work engine's migration `0011_ticket_work_engine` landed the
ticket's own columns; the story is still to come. The knowledge half of that flow,
find the transcript, retrieve the app and process context, needs the Google
connector above.

## When each piece landed

Lifted out of README.md's opening paragraphs, where five `UPDATED <date>:` stamps had
grown inside the prose describing what is true NOW, including two competing dates for
the same fact. That file is the first thing every reader and every agent opens; current
state should not have to be sifted out of history. The history is not worthless, so it
lives here, where changes already go.

| When | What landed |
|---|---|
| 2026-06-21 | The module formerly called "roles & permissions" became **Member roles** (module key `member_roles`). |
| 2026-06-21 | The team area (Overview, Members, Member roles, Invites) moved to `/t/<teamId>/…` deep-link URLs under the screen engine; top-level `/members` and `/roles` became thin redirects. |
| 2026-06-23 | The **agent-modules build** landed (branch `agent-modules`): learning, help, CSV import and the AI agent all BUILT. |
| 2026-07-07 | The **mcp** worker, the external machine surface, shipped: access tokens bridged to team-pinned sessions, gated doors exposed as MCP tools at `/mcp`. |
| 2026-08-10 | The eighth worker made the roster **eight**: six brains under two front doors, `gateway` and `portal-gateway`. |
| 2026-08-11 | The module called "help" became **Tickets**, everywhere a person or a URL can see it. There was never a help section *and* a ticket section; there was one module wearing the wrong name, and an agency does not need somewhere to file complaints about its own app. The permission key, the tables, the API path and the MCP tool names stay `help` on purpose (DATA-MODEL.md § *help + help_threads* lists all four and why each never moves). |
| 2026-08-11 | **Google sign-in came back on**, a decision REVERSED, not a new feature. `db/core/0003` parked it on 2026-06-12 as a *Brimba* scope call (the generic base, email codes only); kwapso's SCOPE re-decides it in ch.03 and ch.06, and SCOPE wins where it speaks. Rebuilt without re-adding `google_sub`, the verified email is the identity, so both doors go through one seam. The migration is not reverted; it carries a comment pointing forward. The Brimba base upstream may still be email-only. |

## The meta-lesson (worth its own guardrail)

Two of the worst issues (the agent confirm gap, the fork-sweep leaving live URLs) **slipped past our own checks because a check encoded the wrong intent**, a test that asserted the vulnerable behaviour as correct, and a sweep rule that treated a live URL as "history." An incumbent review rationalises what's already there. **Schedule a periodic fresh, no-prior-context review** (a clean clone, independent agents), it finds what the incumbent gate accepts. This is why the base now recommends running the audits against a *pristine* clone, not the working tree.
