# Error handling & logging, the ruleset (LOCKED 2026-06-17)

How the Kwapso System (and every app on this base) handles failures: **never swallow an
error silently**; capture it *with context* and send it somewhere queryable, so
a crash is visible without the user having to report it.

## The one seam

There is ONE swappable reporter. Today it logs to Cloudflare's **Workers
observability** (already enabled on every worker); to send errors to
Sentry/Datadog later, change ONLY the seam's body. Call sites never move (same
trick as the swappable AI-import interface).

- **Client, `shared/web/log.ts`** → `reportError(where, error, extra?)`: one seam,
  both front ends, the agency app and the client portal import the same file.
  - logs to the console (for the developer), and
  - beacons a compact `{where, message, stack, url, at}` to `POST /api/log/client`.
- **Client global handlers**, `installGlobalErrorReporting()` (mounted once by
  `<ErrorReporter/>` in the root layout) listens for `window.onerror` +
  `unhandledrejection`. These catch the **async** throws a React error boundary
  can't see, the ones that otherwise show the blank "a client-side exception
  has occurred" overlay.
- **Client render errors, `<ErrorBoundary>`** wraps risky subtrees (the team
  panels. UPDATED 2026-06-21: the team area is now the screen-engine-rendered
  `/t/<teamId>/<module>/<id>` subtree). On a render throw it shows the kit's
  whole-page `PageFailureScreen` (chapter 21, 500) with one honest, generic
  sentence — **the same one on every host** — and calls `reportError` with the
  component stack. UPDATED 2026-08-29: the raw `error.message` used to render
  inline for everybody; the owner ruled a production visitor should see exactly
  what staff see, nothing more. The raw message still renders, but only when
  `window.location`'s host is `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` or contains `staging` —
  the diagnostic value stayed, gated to the hosts that are ours.
- **Both gateways, `/api/log/client`.** Each front end has its own door on its own
  origin: the agency gateway carries one for `web/`, the portal gateway carries one
  for `web-portal/`. Both do the same two things, log the beacon (`console.error`,
  capped) AND, when the browser carries a session cookie the worker has **verified**
  with auth (an anonymous drive-by must not be able to fill a table in the GLOBAL
  core database), forward it to auth's `/internal/log-error` (INTERNAL_KEY-guarded)
  so the error also lands in the central store below. They stamp different `source`
  values (`web` and `portal`) so a crash on a client's phone is told apart from one
  on a staff screen. Without `INTERNAL_KEY` set on **both** gateways, the beacon is
  console-only, the crash is seen by nobody.
- **Workers** `console.error` in their `catch` blocks → observability, AND every
  core-bound worker's central catch calls `recordWorkerError(env.DB, …)`
  (`shared/workers/error-log.ts`) so the crash lands in the store below,
  machine-checked by `workers/data-ops/test/error-seam.test.ts`, so a worker
  can't quietly stop recording. `GuardError`s map to clean 4xx and are NEVER
  logged (an expected refusal is not an error); unexpected errors become a
  generic 500 (never leak internals to the user).

## The central error store (BUILT 2026-07-03, core migration `0012_error_logs`)

Beyond the console lines (which Cloudflare keeps only ~a week), every unexpected
failure is RECORDED in **`error_logs`** in the global core DB, one table per
environment (staging and production errors never mix), cross-team by design
(system health is global; `team_id`/`user_id` are optional context).

- **Captured per row:** `id`, `at`, `source`, one of `auth`, `tenancy`, `content`,
  `data-ops`, `mcp`, `realtime` (the six workers that bind the core DB and record
  their own crashes), `web` (a beacon from the agency screens), `portal` (a beacon
  from the client portal's screens) and `portal-gateway` (the portal door's own
  crash, which it reports through auth because it binds no database of its own),
  `place` (the route `POST /api/…`, or the client's `where`),
  `message`, `stack` (capped), `team_id` / `user_id` / `url` when known, and the
  resolve-workflow fields: `status` (`open` → `resolved`), `resolved_at`,
  `resolution_note`.
- **NOT captured:** clean `GuardError` refusals (4xx, working as designed).
  Recording is best-effort by contract, a logging hiccup never changes a
  response.
- **BOUNDED per caller (2026-08-11, core migration `0019_error_log_bound`):**
  `MAX_ERROR_LOGS_PER_HOUR` (120) rows per bucket per trailing hour, where a
  bucket is `COALESCE(user_id, source)`, the person whose browser beaconed it,
  or the worker that crashed. The ceiling rides the INSERT's own `WHERE`
  (CONCURRENCY.md: a read-then-write throttle is a suggestion under load), and
  going over moves zero rows, which is **silence, not an error**, the seam's
  contract is that recording never breaks the request it is recording.
  **Why it exists:** `POST /api/log/client` forwards a browser's crash into the
  GLOBAL core DB. Every FIELD was capped; the row COUNT was not, so a signed-in
  caller with a loop could grow the core database until it hit its size alarm,
  the store that says what broke becoming the thing that broke. **Why a ceiling
  and not a dedup window:** the message is the caller's own body, so anything
  keyed on repeated CONTENT is defeated by putting a counter in the string; a
  ceiling bounds rows whatever the body says. **Why per bucket:** a flood of
  client beacons must never spend the budget a crashing worker needs to report
  itself, and one noisy browser must not mute anybody else's.
  **Retention:** a nightly sweep trims rows older than 90 days (shipped 14 Aug 2026); the per-caller ceiling bounds the RATE rather than the total,
  so the table grows at up to 120 rows per active caller per hour — and the
  nightly retention sweep trims rows older than 90 days (shipped 14 Aug 2026;
  this line called it "the next step" for twelve days after it ran nightly).
  The size alarms (OPERATIONS.md) stay as the backstop.
- **View (owner-only, x-admin-key, the maintenance key):**
  `GET /api/data-ops/admin/errors?status=open|resolved|all&limit=N`, newest
  first. In practice: ask Claude to read it, or curl it.
- **Resolve (the what-went-wrong / how-fixed trail):**
  `POST /api/data-ops/admin/errors/resolve { id, note }`, flips the row to
  `resolved`, stamps `resolved_at`, stores your note. Re-resolving overwrites
  the note (idempotent). An unknown id returns `updated: 0`.
- **Why owner-gated, not a team screen:** stack traces are maintainer material,
  not tenant data. An in-app owner console is a later milestone, it needs a
  "platform owner" identity concept the base deliberately doesn't have yet.
- **What a person reports lives in Tickets**; this store is the system's own
  telemetry. The two meet when you resolve an error and answer the ticket. There
  is no separate help section and no in-app bug-report channel for the app
  itself, a ticket is something an account asked us for.

## Analysing the store, the `error_analyst` skill

The store is the data; **`error_analyst`** (a global skill) is how you read it at
scale. It's platform-aware (it finds where errors live, this table on the Kwapso System,
Supabase/CloudWatch/etc. on another app), **clusters rows by root cause** (ten rows
with one signature = one bug seen ten times), flags **first-of-its-kind vs
recurring** (and, for a recurrence after a fix, digs up the prior `resolution_note`
to escalate a patch into a structural fix), shows trends per module, and, for the
fixes it's confident about, applies them, runs `npm run check`, ships to **staging**,
and resolves the errors with a note. Production stays owner-gated. Run it when you
want to understand + fix what's breaking, not patch one row. It is the operational
sibling of the pre-ship trio (`lean_mean_check` · `story_checks_out` ·
`security_sentry`).

## How planet-scale apps do it (what we're set up to grow into)
- **Capture everything with context** (request id, user, route, release/version).
- **Sample** at high volume, you don't store 100% of billions of events.
- **Alert** on spikes/new error types; **source maps** so a minified stack maps
  to real code.
- Our seam means adopting a service later is a one-file change, not a refactor.

## Rules for new code
1. Every `catch` either handles the error meaningfully or calls the reporter.
   Never an empty `catch {}` that hides a failure (logging-only `catch` for
   best-effort side-effects like activity writes is fine, and is commented as such).
   **`logActivity` is that pattern's canonical case, and it records the gap** —
   the swallow stays (a logging hiccup must never break the action it describes)
   and the loss is durable: the catch writes an `error_logs` row naming the
   database, the table and the row the missing line was about, which is the pair
   somebody needs to put it back by hand. **Swallowed is not the same as
   unrecorded.**
   **The exception is a write where the ROW IS THE POINT**, and then the swallow
   is wrong: `writeActivity` throws instead. Two callers — a user-authored
   activity note (a note that fails to save must not answer 200), and
   `deleteProcessStep`, the app's one hard delete of a business record, where the
   activity line is the ONLY remaining record that the step existed. Losing "role
   changed" costs a sentence; losing that one takes the record and its history
   together.
2. **Member-notification emails (new 2026-06-21)** are best-effort, same pattern
   as activity writes. When a role changes, a member is removed, or a pending
   invite is revoked, the **state change is the authority and commits FIRST**;
   the notification email is fired after and is logging-only on failure (bounce,
   Resend 4xx/5xx, or timeout). A failed or bounced email **NEVER blocks or rolls
   back the action**, the permission change stands regardless.
3. User-facing messages stay plain and safe; the detail goes to the logs.
4. Wrap any new risky UI subtree in `<ErrorBoundary>`.

See [CACHING.md](CACHING.md) for the loading/feedback side (what the user sees
*while* things are working) and [CONCURRENCY.md](CONCURRENCY.md) for write safety.

## The white screen, containment + prevention (C1)
A thrown RENDER error is not caught by the `window.onerror` reporter (that fires
for events, not React's render phase), it blanks the tree. Both halves are now in
place:

- **Containment:** the `ErrorBoundary` is MOUNTED in the root layout
  (`web/app/layout.tsx`) around the routed screens AND the co-pilot host, so a
  render throw becomes a readable "something went wrong here + Try again" card and
  reports through `reportError` to the central `error_logs`. Never a blank page.
- **…and it HEALS one class rather than reporting it (added 2026-08-18).** A
  render throw that is really a STALE SHELL — the tab holds an old build and asks
  for a chunk this deploy no longer has — is not a bug in the screen, and the
  boundary is the only thing in the tree that sees it. `componentDidCatch` reports
  first (the beacon survives an unload, so the row is kept: "how often does a
  deploy strand an open tab" needs an answer), then hands the error to
  `healStaleShell` from `web/components/version-watch.tsx`, which reloads once
  behind a 30-second cooldown; `render` says "A new version of the app is ready."
  rather than printing a chunk id at a manager. Earned by three rows on staging on
  2026-08-17, forty seconds apart, the middle one carrying a hand-typed `?v=2` —
  the guard for this shipped on 2026-06-30 and had never once fired, because it
  was bound to `window.onerror` and `unhandledrejection` and React's render phase
  dispatches neither. See EDGE-CASES.md § *version-watch*.
- **Prevention:** the crash class was a hook called BELOW a top-level early return
  (React #310/#300, the hook count changes between renders). `web/test/hooks-order.test.ts`
  walks every component/hook in `web/` and fails any `use*()` (or `React.use*()`)
  call that appears after a depth-1 `return`. The check is worth more than any one
  fix, it makes the class unshippable at 100 modules or 1,000 screens.
