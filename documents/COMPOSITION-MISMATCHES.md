# Composition mismatches — why the number stops where it stops

The owner's target is 47 of 47 kit compositions (`shared/ui/compositions/`)
imported into the app. It began as the record of a full pass over the 23
`templates/` and `overlays/` compositions assigned to one lane on 2026-08-29,
**re-examined the same day** after a peer's correction (below) turned two of
the seventeen rejections into doors — and it now also carries the `screens/`
and `states/` findings from the second lane's pass, so one file answers "why
did this one stop" for the whole catalogue rather than two files each
answering half.

## FINAL RESOLUTION — 47 of 47, decided (2026-08-30)

Everything below this section is the record of how each verdict was reached —
kept in place because, per this file's own rule, "a record of why something
was rejected is only useful while it is true," and several of these records
are still exactly that record. This section is the answer itself: every one
of the 47 files under `shared/ui/compositions/` now has a verdict, enforced
by **R45** (`shared/rules/registry.ts`'s `COMPOSITION_EXEMPT`, checked by
`composition-coverage` in `web/test/rules.test.ts`) so the count cannot
silently regress the next time the kit ships a 48th file or an app screen
quietly duplicates one.

**What changed to close the gap from 37 to 47, and why three earlier verdicts moved:**

- **The missing ten**, never individually decided before today: nine
  `screens/` files (`brand`, `company-hub`, `home`, `onboarding`, `portal-home`,
  `portal-impact`, `profile`, `settings`, `sign-in-system`) and
  `templates/record-chrome.tsx` — the last one is the single strangest gap in
  the whole file, because it is infrastructure this document has been calling
  "already-adopted" by name in a dozen places (`RecordChrome`, the host seam
  every record screen composes) without ever giving the kit file it comes from
  its own line.
- **A factual correction**: `templates/sign-in.tsx` was credited with the
  agency login "landing" — it did not. Direct-import grep proves the agency
  door renders `screens/sign-in-system.tsx`'s `LoginRoute`; `templates/sign-in.tsx`
  is a separate, real adoption of its own (`AuthPhotograph`, used by the
  portal shell for its sign-in artwork). Both are adopted; neither should have
  been credited for the other.
- **Three retractions**, each because a deeper structural check ran where the
  2026-08-29 pass only checked an optional prop. On record because, as this
  file already says once, the retraction matters as much as the finding:
  - `overlays/access-denied.tsx` — `grantor={null}` really is a clean opt-out
    (that finding holds), but the composition's non-optional premise (a Dialog
    over the actual requested screen, blurred behind it) has no real call site
    in either door: the agency's denial is an inline sentence inside a
    persistent shell with no page-behind concept, and the portal's is a total,
    whole-session denial with no screen behind it at all. Downgraded `[~]` → `[!]`.
  - `overlays/delete-confirmation.tsx` — `confirmWord={null}` really is a
    clean opt-out for the one-press case (that finding holds too), but
    `recordNumber` is a REQUIRED prop baked into the dialog's own title
    sentence, and this app's actual deactivate targets (roles, accounts,
    members) have no record-number vocabulary at all — and the composition's
    whole premise is irreversible deletion, where this app's law is
    deactivate-never-delete. Downgraded `[~]` → `[!]`.
  - `templates/stat-strip.tsx` — the `spark`-is-optional finding was correct
    but incomplete: `pulse.tsx` already draws its headline numbers through the
    kit's own `StatGrid` component directly, the exact primitive this
    composition is built on top of, and the one thing it would add — a
    per-tile mini-chart — is precisely the numbers/chart fusion `pulse.tsx`'s
    own law forbids on these tiles. Reclassified `[~]` → realized differently.
  - `templates/form-screen.tsx` stays `[!]` but the reason moved: `surface="page"`
    really is a bare div (confirmed twice now), so the dialog-vs-sheet
    objection is resolved — but the composition's real value over `FormShell`
    is a required-fields-by-name summary and a changed-fields-by-name dirty
    band, and none of `FormShell`'s 32+ callers track fields by name today.
    That is a real, scoped feature to build, not a chrome swap behind one flag.
  - `screens/session-expired.tsx` was filed under a `[!]` heading despite its
    own text already saying "there is no current app equivalent to compare
    against at all" — reclassified to `[ ]`, a real, unscoped finding rather
    than a mismatch.
  - `templates/portal-home.tsx`, `templates/record-route.tsx`,
    `templates/detail-screen.tsx`, `templates/main-screen.tsx`,
    `templates/collection-screen.tsx` were filed under the `[x] Adopted`
    heading despite each one's own text saying the file itself is not
    imported — the job is done, natively or by composing other
    already-adopted kit parts under different names. Relabelled as their own
    outcome, **realized differently**, rather than counted as adoptions the
    direct-import census could ever verify.

**The verdict vocabulary, six outcomes now that "realized differently" is
named as its own kind of answer rather than folded into "adopted" or "mismatch":**

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[x]` | Adopted — a direct `@shared/ui/compositions/...` import in `web/`, `web-portal/` or `shared/web/`. |
| `[=]` | Realized differently — this app already does the identical job, natively or by composing other already-adopted kit parts under other names; importing this exact file would duplicate working code. |
| `[!]` | Genuine structural mismatch, checked against the file's own required props and documented behaviour. |
| `[ ]` | A real gap — the app has nothing serving this job — with a stated reason: permanent (a model that rules it out) or a live finding. |
| `[?]` | A genuine two-sided question, with a recommendation. |

**The 47, one row each** (full reasoning for every non-adopted file lives in
`COMPOSITION_EXEMPT`, `shared/rules/registry.ts` — this is the pointer the
build itself checks against):

| Composition | Verdict | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `overlays/access-denied.tsx` | `[!]` | No real call site for a dialog-over-the-blurred-page: neither door has "one denied module, real page still open behind it." |
| `overlays/assistant.tsx` | `[!]` | Kit's own composition is a right-hand `Sheet` despite chapter 19's corner-bubble ruling; its flat `CopilotMessage` model can't carry this app's streamed chunks, tool-step rows, R23 citations, or staged attachments. |
| `overlays/bulk-edit.tsx` | `[?]` | The selection primitive is real and unblocked; recommend not adopting yet — no collection performs a bulk write today. |
| `overlays/delete-confirmation.tsx` | `[!]` | `recordNumber` required, no numbered-record vocabulary here; whole premise is irreversible delete, this app only deactivates. |
| `overlays/export.tsx` | `[!]` | `columns` not optional; this app's export is a one-click filtered `<a href>`, no scope/column picker exists. |
| `overlays/filter-builder.tsx` | `[!]` | AND-chained condition rows have no analog in this app's single-valued closed-vocabulary facet chips. |
| `overlays/import-proposal.tsx` | `[!]` | Same root as the import trio — no manual per-column mapping UI to plug a review step into. |
| `overlays/import.tsx` | `[!]` | Five-step manual-mapping wizard; this app's import is agentic, multi-table, FK-resolving. |
| `overlays/quick-view.tsx` | `[ ]` | Permanent — every row's Enter/Space navigates straight to the record; no peek pattern anywhere. |
| `screens/brand.tsx` | `[ ]` | A real, minor finding — no staff-facing design-token reference page exists; the Brand library is a different, client-asset concept. |
| `screens/company-hub.tsx` | `[!]` | `account-detail.tsx` already does this job with a different anatomy (tabs, rate cards, companies-vs-people split). |
| `screens/home.tsx` | `[!]` | Kit embeds a live ticket queue inline; this app's home shows figures plus link-out cards — a different product decision. |
| `screens/invite-acceptance.tsx` | `[!]` | Assumes one pre-account invite screen; this app's real flow is a post-sign-in inbox of every pending invite. |
| `screens/link-sent.tsx` | `[!]` | Built around a magic link on a possibly different device; this app sends a 6-digit code, same device, same form. |
| `screens/not-found.tsx` | `[!]` | Built for one bad record inside a fine collection; this app's `<NotFound />` fires with no collection context at all. |
| `screens/onboarding.tsx` | `[!]` | Kit's 3-step tour has no analog; this app's onboarding is a single-step name/photo form wired to closed-team-creation logic. |
| `screens/page-failure.tsx` | `[x]` | Adopted — the portal's whole-page failure takeover. |
| `screens/portal-boot.tsx` | `[!]` | Its two registers are the already-rejected static splash and the already-adopted page-failure screen. |
| `screens/portal-home.tsx` | `[=]` | Route wrapper around `templates/portal-home.tsx`'s already-realized shape. |
| `screens/portal-impact.tsx` | `[!]` | Kit's is a flat progress report; this app's `/impact` is an interactive App→Process→Step drill-down with pricing. |
| `screens/profile.tsx` | `[!]` | This app edits via a popup dialog beside a summary + activity feed; the kit is an inline full-page form. |
| `screens/session-expired.tsx` | `[ ]` | A real, unscoped finding — nothing persists identity or a return destination across a 401 today. |
| `screens/settings.tsx` | `[!]` | Kit assumes one six-tab Settings screen; this app deliberately scattered the same settings across three destinations. |
| `screens/sign-in-portal.tsx` | `[?]` | One real law disagreement (no social row) vs. SCOPE ch.06's Google row; recommend keeping the app's Google row. |
| `screens/sign-in-system.tsx` | `[x]` | Adopted — confirmed by direct import: the agency login renders this file's `LoginRoute`. |
| `screens/sign-in.tsx` | `[!]` | Magic-link-only shell, the opposite of this app's code-based sign-in; its `AuthShell` sibling has no live route either. |
| `screens/splash.tsx` | `[!]` | Kit's boot screen is a static, non-animated mark; this app's is a deliberate, dated, owner-motivated looping animation. |
| `states/archive.tsx` | `[x]` | Adopted, partially and for real — the consequence-band is shipped live on Tickets; the other two laws are scoped per-collection work. |
| `states/empty-collection.tsx` | `[x]` | Adopted, partially and for real — the `emptyBody` register is live; the figure-strip/zero-badge half needs unbuilt engine concepts. |
| `states/new-empty-record.tsx` | `[!]` | A real equivalent exists, just scattered across every record-detail file rather than unified. |
| `states/no-results.tsx` | `[!]` | A real, richer register exists in the kit, but it needs an unbuilt engine computation; the current plain sentence is not a dead end. |
| `states/states.tsx` | `[x]` | Adopted — `ShapeStateBody` is the shared engine's loading/error/empty register. |
| `templates/collection-screen.tsx` | `[=]` | Renders `MainScreen` internally; shares that file's already-realized finding. |
| `templates/detail-screen.tsx` | `[=]` | `ScreenShell` + `RecordChrome`, already assembled under other names; this app's persistent header is a deliberate difference, not a gap. |
| `templates/form-screen.tsx` | `[!]` | Its real value (field-name-aware validation summary) needs state no form in this app tracks today — a feature to build, not a chrome swap. |
| `templates/import-flow.tsx` | `[!]` | Same root as the import trio. |
| `templates/main-screen.tsx` | `[=]` | `ScreenShell` + `CollectionFrame(tone="bare")`, already reached independently; the one open question was decided not pursued. |
| `templates/multi-step-form.tsx` | `[ ]` | Permanent — no wizard-style form exists anywhere; confirmed by the kit's own runtime warning. |
| `templates/portal-home.tsx` | `[=]` | `web-portal/components/home-screen.tsx` already implements the identical spec natively. |
| `templates/rail.tsx` | `[x]` | Adopted 2026-08-31 — `AppShell` renders it directly; the team switcher composes above it (no Rail slot fits a workspace switcher). |
| `templates/record-chrome.tsx` | `[x]` | Adopted — confirmed by direct import; the record-detail host seam every record screen composes through. |
| `templates/record-route.tsx` | `[=]` | `ScreenShell` + `RecordChrome` + `StepperHero`, already assembled under other names. |
| `templates/screen-shell.tsx` | `[x]` | Adopted and landed — `AppShell` now composes this directly, verified navigating (R37 object-identity check). |
| `templates/search-results.tsx` | `[ ]` | A real finding — no global search exists anywhere; worth the owner's separate consideration. |
| `templates/sign-in.tsx` | `[x]` | Adopted — confirmed by direct import: the portal shell's `AuthPhotograph`. |
| `templates/stat-strip.tsx` | `[=]` | `pulse.tsx` already draws its numbers through the kit's own `StatGrid`, the primitive this file wraps; its one addition is forbidden here by house law. |
| `templates/stepper-hero.tsx` | `[x]` | Adopted — the ticket status track, verified live at all four widths, both themes. |

**Tally: 9 adopted, 6 realized differently, 24 mismatch, 3 owner's-call, 5 real
gaps = 47.** Every one decided; none left for the next lane to re-discover.

---

**Reading this file:** `[x]` means the composition fits and was adopted. `[~]`
means it is now judged ADOPTABLE — a real opt-out or override was found on
re-examination — but has not been rolled out yet; each one names what a
prototype still needs to prove. `[!]` means a genuine, structural mismatch
survives re-examination under the three conditions below, and the reason is
written under it. `[ ]` means no current app equivalent exists to compare
against. `[?]` means it's a real candidate that needs a human call.

Every verdict here was reached by reading the composition's actual props
interface and doc header, then reading the app's real current equivalent
side by side — never by matching on a name. See CLAUDE.md's own warning: an
audit on 27 Aug 2026 matched five app-side files against kit files sharing
their name and reported 4,122 lines of "shadowed kit code" that did not
exist, because `visibility`/`notes`/`collection-frame`/`screen-renderer` do
different jobs from their kit namesakes. The same discipline applies here in
reverse — a composition can share a NAME's job and still not share its
CONTRACT (RecordChrome vs. DetailScreen is the example the app already lived
through).

## A note on the numbers: adoptions the census cannot see

`KIT-COVERAGE.md`'s `[x]`/`[ ]` count is a census of DIRECT imports — it
greps `@shared/ui/...` import strings in `web/`, `web-portal/` and
`shared/web/`. That undercounts real adoption whenever this app reaches a
kit part THROUGH another kit part it already imports, because the inner
import never appears in the app's own source. Four confirmed so far:

- **`notes`** shows unchecked, but `comments/comments.tsx` (already
  adopted, `[x]`) imports it directly (`import { Notes } from
  "../notes/notes"`) and is built on top of it. Every place `Comments`
  renders in this app is already drawing `Notes`'s row.
- **`folder`** shows unchecked, but `tabs/tabs.tsx` (already adopted,
  `[x]`) imports it for the `variant="folder"` tab strip already in use
  (`web/components/deep-link/screen-bits.tsx`'s `SectionWithCreate`,
  `folderTabs` slot).
- **`title`** shows unchecked, but the kit's own `record-detail.tsx`
  (already adopted, `[x]`) imports and renders it — every recipe-driven
  detail screen has been drawing through `Title`'s composition all along,
  reached from inside a kit part rather than from this app's own source.
- **`motion`** (a foundation, not a component) shows unchecked, but both
  front doors' own `globals.css` reach it: 30 keyframes load into both
  stylesheets, 29 of them actually used at runtime. The census only scans
  `web/`, `web-portal/` and `shared/web/` import STRINGS; a CSS `@import`
  or a build-time asset pull into a stylesheet is invisible to that grep
  the same way a nested component import is.

Neither is a gap to close — all four are already reaching this app, just
invisible to a grep that only looks one import deep (three) or only looks
at import strings at all (the fourth). The real number of kit parts
genuinely serving this app is `[x]`'s count plus at least these four, and
there is currently no automated way to find the rest of them (the check
would need to walk each `[x]` component's own import graph AND its
stylesheet's own pulls, not just the app's). Worth a `kit-coverage.mjs`
enhancement if the owner wants the number itself to be trustworthy rather
than a floor.

## THE 2026-08-29 CORRECTION — READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING AN OLDER VERDICT

The first pass over these 23 checked whether a claim about a composition was
**true** and not whether it was **dispositive** — the same shallow-review
mistake the peer who caught it named twice that day. Re-reading all
seventeen `[!]` verdicts under three conditions a first read had missed:

1. **An optional prop is not a mismatch.** Several "requires X" claims were
   never checked against the component's own opt-out. `ScreenShell`'s `rail`
   prop defaults to `<Rail />` but the file's own header states
   `rail={null}` is a real, supported opt-out; `DeleteConfirmationDialog`'s
   `confirmWord` accepts `null` for the one-press case with no typed word at
   all; `AccessDeniedScreen`'s "Request access" control and its "who can
   grant it" well are ONE conditional block, gated on `grantor`, and an
   `undefined` grantor renders neither; `StepperHero`'s `onStageSelect` is
   optional and its own register 10 states the read-only case in words.
   Four "requires a feature we don't have" verdicts were actually "requires
   a feature we don't have **unless you don't pass the prop that turns it
   on**," and nobody had checked.
2. **The kit is no longer fixed.** The owner has granted permission to fix
   genuine bugs in Kwapso/kwapso-ui-ux upstream, tag, and re-import — never to
   hand-edit `shared/ui/` directly (hash-pinned; that turns the build red),
   and never to reshape the aesthetic. Where a composition's own behaviour
   (not its data shape) was the blocker, that changes what "mismatch" means:
   it's a fix to propose upstream, not a wall.
3. **Assemble from components where no composition exists.** A `[ ]` verdict
   ("no current app equivalent") is not the end of the question — the kit's
   own components can sometimes be assembled into the missing shape by the
   kit's own rules, rather than left as a gap.

Two corrections are recorded below in full because they change the actual
architecture question — the ScreenShell-owns-the-rail family and
`DeleteConfirmationDialog` — and one has already shipped (`StepperHero`,
verified live). The rest hold: an optional prop or an upstream fix was
checked for and genuinely does not exist. Where a verdict changed, the
superseded reasoning is removed rather than kept beside the new one — "a
record of why something was rejected is only useful while it is true."

## [x] Adopted

**`shared/ui/compositions/templates/rail.tsx`, for real, 2026-08-31.** Moved
here from `[?] Needs a human call` — see that section (now 2, not 3) for the
full account of what changed and the two findings it surfaced (the
`onSelect`-only wiring Rail's own missing `preventDefault` requires, and the
member chip's missing photo slot). `web/components/app-shell.tsx` now builds
`RailGroup[]`/`RailMember` from `lib/pages.ts` and the signed-in user and
renders `Rail` directly, `spine="paper"` to match `ScreenShell` below it. The
`COMPOSITION_EXEMPT["templates/rail.tsx"]` line in `shared/rules/registry.ts`
is deleted with this change (R45's own ratchet: an exemption for a
composition now directly reached is stale).

**`shared/ui/compositions/templates/stepper-hero.tsx`, read-only, for the
ticket status track** (`web/components/help-status-stepper.tsx`).
`RecordChrome`'s own `headerExtra` slot forwards to the kit's `hero` prop —
named for exactly this composition. `door="system"` (7 stages) matches
`HELP_STATUSES` exactly; no `onStageSelect` is passed, which register 10 of
the composition's own doc states in words: "the strip states, and nothing
moves" — the identical read-only contract `StatusStepper` already gave this
screen directly, now with the hero treatment (fold-after-5, the current
stage's only mango, tabular stage numbers) `StatusStepper` alone never drew.
Verified live at 390/768/1280/1920, both themes
(`scripts/lane-shots/verify-stepper-hero.mjs`) — the "+2" fold reads cleanly
at every width including the narrowest phone wrap. No new i18n strings (no
`copy`/label props passed). Committed `811cc5ef`.

**Not** applied to `story-status-stepper.tsx`: stories have 4 stages, and
the kit's only 4-stage progression (`door="delivery"`) is a **vertical
wizard rail**, not the horizontal record hero — the composition's own header
says so in words: "the kit draws no four-stage record vocabulary." Forcing
`door="delivery"` would swap a horizontal pill row for a sidebar-shaped
stepper on every story. Left on `StatusStepper` directly, which was already
the correct, minimal adoption for that screen.

**`shared/ui/components/collection-frame/collection-frame.tsx`'s underlying
STATE capability** (loading/error, not the full component — see `[~]`
below) — `shared/web/screen-engine/collection-frame.tsx`, wired to the kit's
`ShapeStateBody`. Committed `3115b132`, merged `e9b6c157`. Full detail
unchanged from the first pass; see git history rather than repeat it here.

**The ScreenShell-owns-the-rail family (6 templates) — LANDED.**
`templates/detail-screen.tsx`, `record-route.tsx`, `collection-screen.tsx`,
`main-screen.tsx`, `screen-shell.tsx` and `portal-home.tsx` were first
rejected because all six compose `ScreenShell`, which draws a rail, and
this app already has one persistent, app-wide sidebar
(`web/components/app-shell.tsx`). That check never read whether the rail's
CONTENTS were forced — they are not: `rail={null}` is a real, documented
opt-out, confirmed both by reading the prop doc and by a peer's render
probe (zero `nav`/`aside` elements, no 13rem column in the markup, for all
six). What survived that correction was a real, different question:
`ScreenShell` is a per-route composition and `AppShell` is the persistent
one R37 requires — using the templates as documented (each instantiating
its own `<ScreenShell rail={…}>` per screen) would remount the rail's DOM
on every navigation even though the outer app-wide shell never unmounts.

Resolved by composing bare `screen-shell.tsx` ONCE, at the layout level —
`web/components/app-shell.tsx` now renders `<ScreenShell spine="paper"
rail={…}>{children}</ScreenShell>` instead of its own hand-rolled
`<aside>`/`<div>` structure, with the rail's actual content (TeamSwitcher,
both nav groups, ProfileMenu, the collapse toggle) re-homed as the `rail`
node, byte-identical otherwise. `spine="paper"` is explicit — the shell's
own default is `spine="mango"`, a later ruling this app hasn't adopted.

> **Both spine sentences above are the record of 2026-08-31 and are no longer
> current.** The spine became a per-person setting, so `app-shell.tsx` passes
> `spine={spine}` rather than a literal; and on **2026-09-02 the client ruled
> the default to mango** ("default spine to mango, but everyone can change it
> during the onboarding or anytime at settings"), so the divergence this
> paragraph names is gone — `DEFAULT_SPINE` and `ScreenShell`'s own default
> are the same value again. The prop is still passed explicitly, because the
> rail must paint what *this person* chose rather than what the shell would
> guess. `shared/spine.ts` keeps the overturned argument in full.

VERIFIED NAVIGATING, not at rest, because a bad prototype here looks fine
in a still frame and only fails on navigation
(`scripts/lane-shots/verify-screen-shell-appshell.mjs`): an `ElementHandle`
for the rail's root node was captured on initial load, then four real
in-app navigations were driven (Home → Accounts → Tickets → Stories →
Home), re-querying the same selector after each click and comparing
against the ORIGINAL handle with `===` — object identity, not a "looks the
same" check. PASS on all four; R37 holds. Also verified at 390/768/1280/
1920, both themes. The sticky-height risk this integration raised (a bare
flex rail column stretches to the tallest sibling — the exact "flash" bug
the removed `<aside>` comment described) is solved by the rail content
cancelling the shell column's own `--rail-inset` padding with an equal
negative margin and re-spending it on itself, so it can carry its own
`sticky top-0 h-[100svh] overflow-y-auto` independent of a column the shell
owns.

Caught two real mistakes before landing: an arbitrary `pb-20` (80px, not on
the kit's admitted spacing scale — `design-scale.test.ts` caught it) where
the old code's `pb-24` (96px, admitted) was the value actually needed; and
`web/test/shell-nav.test.ts` had two assertions that string-matched the old
`<aside>` tag directly, which failed against the new shape even though the
property they guard (rail is one window tall, pinned, scrolls internally)
still held — fixed on main (`4bc9b1f9`) to find the rail by what it does
rather than by its tag, so it now passes on either shape.

**One known, accepted consequence, not a bug to "fix" later:** on a screen
with nothing to show in the header slot (no breadcrumbs, no running timer —
e.g. Home on a phone), `ScreenShell` still spends the header band's density
padding, because it only checks whether the `header` prop is a truthy
node, not whether what's inside it renders anything. Gating `header` on
content would also drop the desktop `TimerBar` row on breadcrumb-less
pages — trading a cosmetic gap for a functional loss — so it stays. A
record page (RecordChrome draws its own header inside the body, not this
slot) shows no such gap.

Prototyped on `experiment/screen-shell-appshell` (`b84d208d`, `fab6965e`
after rebasing on the `shell-nav.test.ts` fix), landed on this branch by
merge after the planner's review.

### The other five ScreenShell-family templates — collected now that the rail objection is gone

The six-composition family's rejection was the duplicate-rail objection.
That fell for all six at once (above). Read the remaining five individually
rather than assuming the correction makes all of them fit — it doesn't,
evenly.

**`templates/record-route.tsx` and `templates/detail-screen.tsx` —
ALREADY REALIZED, no new import needed.** Read both in full: each is
nothing but `ScreenShell` (header slot left EMPTY — override 73 moved
records off a separate header band entirely, "everything the record needs
to say lives in `RecordChrome`'s body pane") wrapping `RecordChrome`;
`record-route.tsx` additionally wires `stages` into `StepperHero`'s hero
slot and computes "Edit steps down to secondary while a stage is
highlighted" (ruling 26: never two mangos). This app already assembles
exactly that shape, out of the same two-to-three parts, already adopted
individually: `AppShell` is now `ScreenShell` (this file), every record
screen composes `RecordChrome` through the `RecordScreen` host seam
(`web/components/record-chrome.tsx`), and `StepperHero` is in the hero
slot wherever a record has stages worth showing (`help-status-stepper.tsx`,
this session). There is no additional composition to import — the shape
these two templates document is already built, from parts, under different
file names. The one real difference is a decision already made rather than
a gap: `AppShell`'s `ScreenShell` header carries a persistent
breadcrumb+timer row on every screen including records, where
`record-route`/`detail-screen`'s reference leaves that band empty. That's
this app's own choice (one header treatment everywhere) against the kit's
(records get none) — not a technical mismatch, and reversing it would be a
product call, not an adoption.

**`templates/main-screen.tsx` and `templates/collection-screen.tsx` — MOSTLY
REALIZED; one real, unbuilt architecture question.** `collection-screen.tsx`
literally renders `MainScreen` internally ("RENDERS `MainScreen` rather than
assembling chrome of its own") — same finding covers both. Structure:
`ScreenShell` wrapping `CollectionFrame` with `tone="bare"` `inset={false}`
— the EXACT fix this file's own `useKitPanel` entry above landed
independently, confirmed correct by reading the kit's own reference
afterward rather than before. What's NOT yet built: `MainScreen`'s header
band carries a real, PER-SCREEN heading (eyebrow, title, a meta line, header
actions, via the kit's `Title` component) — this app's collection headings
(`CollectionHeading`) render INSIDE the body instead, because `AppShell`'s
`ScreenShell` header is currently generic (the same breadcrumb+timer row on
every screen, threaded in via one `breadcrumbs` prop from
`deep-link-screen.tsx`) rather than carrying per-screen content. Making the
header genuinely per-screen would mean widening that one prop channel from
"a breadcrumb array" to "arbitrary per-screen header content."

**DECIDED, not pursued: `CollectionHeading`-in-body stands.** Raised as an
open question; the planner's answer is no, for the reason the finding
itself already gave — none of the five templates moves the adoption count
(recomposition is invisible to a direct-import census either way), so
widening `AppShell`'s header channel would be a layout change reaching
every collection screen in the app, for a gain nobody could point at,
while the owner is testing live. `CollectionHeading`-in-body now stands on
the exact same footing as the breadcrumb-header decision already made for
records: the templates document a shape this app already built under
different names, and this is the second piece of that shape, decided
rather than left open.

**`templates/portal-home.tsx` — no gain, verdict unchanged.** Reread in
full: this composition isn't in the design artifact at all — the kit's own
header says so ("the honest first sentence is that the kit does not draw
this screen... assembled from the rules the kit DOES state about the
portal"). `web-portal/components/home-screen.tsx` already implements the
identical, portal-specific spec (three-thing "waiting on you," the
three-series savings chart, the scoped ambient field) natively. Nothing
here to adopt that isn't already built, independent of the rail-family
correction.

**Net effect on the family's count:** two of six templates
(`screen-shell.tsx` itself, landed) are truly new; two more
(`record-route.tsx`, `detail-screen.tsx`) describe a shape this app had
already assembled from already-adopted parts before today, under other
names; two (`main-screen.tsx`/`collection-screen.tsx`, one finding) are
mostly there with one real open question; one (`portal-home.tsx`) has
nothing to gain. None of the five is imported directly and none will show
in `KIT-COVERAGE.md`'s count as a result — a different shape of the same
"the census can't see it" problem this file already tracks, this time by
recomposition rather than a transitive import.

## [~] Adoptable — a real opt-out exists, not yet rolled out

### `overlays/delete-confirmation.tsx` — split verdict

**`DeleteConfirmationDialog`: CORRECTED to adoptable.** The first pass
rejected this composition wholesale because "this app never permanently
deletes a record" and "confirm dialogs never collect a reason." That was
checked against `ArchiveConfirmationDialog` (below) and wrongly applied to
its sibling. `DeleteConfirmationDialog`'s own prop doc: "Pass `null` for the
one-press case — the field and the hint are then not drawn at all." With
`confirmWord={null}`, the composition is exactly this app's existing confirm
shape — a title naming the record, body copy, Keep/[verb] — because `verb`,
`confirm` and the body text are all overridable via `labels`/`body`/
`bodyNarrow`. This is a real candidate to replace this app's own bespoke
deactivate-confirm dialogs, and it comes with something they don't have:
the composition's own rule for WHEN to require the typed word — "a single
record deletes on one press. Ten or more, or anything a client can see,
requires typing the word" — a real safety net for a high-stakes deactivation
(an Account visible to a client, say) this app has no equivalent of today.
Not prototyped this pass; the next step is finding this app's actual
deactivate-confirm call sites and checking the copy override surface covers
them before swapping one in.

**`ArchiveConfirmationDialog`: still `[!]`, reasoning unchanged.** Its
`reason` field is not optional in any sense the first pass missed — the
confirm press is disabled until the reason field is armed (`reason.trim().length
>= 3`), and the reason is written into an "Archived tab" this app has no
concept of. This is a real product feature (audit-trail reasons on a
reversible action) this app deliberately does not have, not a prop away from
fitting, and adding it is a product decision beyond a UI-adoption pass.

### `overlays/access-denied.tsx` — CORRECTED to adoptable

The first pass rejected this because the client portal has a written rule
against ever offering a client a self-service "Request access" control. Now
checked against the actual render: `grantor` is optional, and the "who can
grant it" well AND the `Request` link are drawn from ONE conditional block
gated on `grantor !== undefined` — there is no way to get the well without
the button (`Request`'s `onClick` is unconditional inside that block, so
`onRequest` alone does not neutralize it; only omitting `grantor` does).
Passing `grantor={null}` removes the self-service affordance cleanly, while
keeping the denial sentence, the blurred page-behind layer and a `Back`
button. **Update from a peer's render-probe sweep:** the composition's
DEFAULT parameter (`grantor = DEFAULT_GRANTOR`) meant an app that merely
*omitted* the prop, rather than passing `null` explicitly, would still have
rendered a real name and a live `Request` link — a genuine kit bug (the
prop's own doc said "undefined draws no grantor block at all," which was
never true against the actual default), now fixed upstream (kit v1.2.4/
v1.2.5) so `grantor={null}` is the clean, confirmed-by-rendering opt-out.
Pass `null` explicitly, not nothing. This is a real fit for the client
portal's `NoAccess` screen. If the portal still wants to name a contact,
that has to be prose in the description text, not the interactive grantor
row. Not prototyped this pass.

### `templates/stat-strip.tsx` — CORRECTED, partially adoptable

The first pass rejected this outright because `pulse.tsx`'s own law is
"aggregate into a big NUMBER **or** reach for a CHART, never fuse them into
one tile." Unchecked: `StatStrip`'s own header calls the mini chart "the
headline numbers, **each with an optional mini chart**" — `spark` is
optional per tile. Without it, `StatStrip` is exactly a row of headline
numbers with a delta, which is what several of `pulse.tsx`'s bespoke
big-number tiles (via the generic `BandCard` wrapper) already are by hand.
This is a real candidate to replace those specific tiles with the kit's own
component rather than a hand-rolled one — not a candidate for the tiles that
already carry a real chart, which stay exactly as `pulse.tsx`'s law says.
Confirmed by a peer's render probe: `StatStrip` with figures and no `spark`
draws no chart element at all. Not prototyped this pass; needs a scan of
which `pulse.tsx`/`impact-panel.tsx` tiles are number-only today before
swapping any in.

### `templates/form-screen.tsx` (+ `templates/multi-step-form.tsx`) — CORRECTED, per a peer's render probe

The first pass rejected this outright: the composition is a side-sheet, this
app's `FormShell` (`shared/web/form-shell.tsx`, 32+ call sites) is a centred
`Dialog`, and the kit's own doc header states the UX position in words ("a
centred modal is for confirmations only"). A peer rendered `FormScreen` with
`surface="page"` rather than reading the prop table, and found it draws a
**plain div** — no dialog role, no sheet, no scrim. The side-sheet chrome
lives entirely in `surface="panel"`; `surface="page"` is the form BODY
alone. That is the same grain this app already found for records
(`RecordChrome`, not `DetailScreen`'s `ScreenShell` wrapper) — the lower-
level content composes into `FormShell`'s own centred `Dialog`, and the
side-sheet-vs-centred-modal disagreement never has to be litigated because
`FormScreen`'s outer sheet is simply never used. Not prototyped this pass;
next step is reading what `surface="page"` actually expects as its steps/
fields contract and whether it fits `FormShell`'s own field-rendering, before
touching any of the 32+ call sites. `multi-step-form` still has nothing to
attach to (no wizard exists in the app) and is unaffected by this correction.

## [!] Confirmed mismatches, re-examined and unchanged (6)

Four groups below, plus `ArchiveConfirmationDialog` and `StepperHero` for
stories, each recorded once under its sibling's entry rather than twice.

### `overlays/import.tsx`, `templates/import-flow.tsx`, `overlays/import-proposal.tsx`

Re-checked for an opt-out: the five-step state machine
(`IMPORT_STEPS`: upload → map → check → run → report) is the composition's
entire premise, not a configurable subset — there is no prop that skips the
manual per-column mapping step. This app's real import is agentic,
multi-file, multi-table, with dependency ordering and FK resolution (see
AGENTIC-IMPORT.md) and no manual per-column mapping UI exists to plug a step
into. One genuine "assemble from components" candidate surfaced on
re-reading: the RUN and REPORT steps' visual shape (a live progress rail, a
per-row failure list) is closer to a reusable primitive than the wizard
around it, and might be worth lifting standalone for this app's own commit
step — flagged, not attempted this pass.

### `overlays/assistant.tsx`

**Reasoning corrected again, verdict unchanged.** The previous entry claimed
this app's `AgentPanel` was "deliberately modal … because it live-drives the
screen underneath" — stale, and backwards. `AgentPanel`
(`web/components/agent-panel.tsx`) moved off `Sheet` entirely to a
`Popover`-anchored bubble (item 2, 31 Aug 2026: "more like a bubble coming
out of its button, instead of a slide-in"), and its own header comment
records that it was **already** `modal={false}` on the prior `Sheet`
primitive — non-modal is not new here, only the primitive changed. The real
reason is the opposite of the old claim: the screen-trace mechanism
(`agent-host.tsx`'s `go()` / `runAction()` driving the live screen) needs the
underlying screen to stay interactive while the assistant is open, which
non-modal serves, not modal — "you can type in a table while the assistant
is open" is this surface's law regardless of primitive.

Checked again on the same pass, the kit's `overlays/assistant.tsx` /
`CopilotOverlay` still doesn't fit, for two reasons that have nothing to do
with modality:

1. The composition's own file header names it "CONTRADICTION 1" — chapter
   19's ruling calls for a corner-anchored floating card, but what got
   built, on purpose ("because it is the delivery contract"), is a
   right-hand `Sheet` (`copilot-overlay.tsx` lines ~43-68). Adopting it would
   trade one slide-in drawer for another, not for a bubble — the one thing
   this app's own change was asked to fix and the kit's composition still
   isn't.
2. `CopilotOverlay`'s message model is a flat `CopilotMessage` list with no
   concept of this app's streamed text deltas, live tool-step rows, R23
   citations, or staged file attachments — adopting it would mean dropping
   that whole state machine (`web/lib/use-agent-chat.tsx`), not swapping a
   shell.

### `overlays/export.tsx`

Re-checked: `columns` is not optional, and the composition's whole premise
(a scope choice + a column picker + a format choice) has no reduced mode.
This app's actual export is a one-click `<a href>` honoring the current
filter querystring server-side — a deliberately simpler shape, confirmed
unchanged. A peer's render probe agrees: `ExportScreen` with no `formats`
and no `columns` still draws the scope radio — the one HELD verdict out of
six re-tested by rendering. Export really is a scope decision in this
composition, not an omitted default.

### `overlays/filter-builder.tsx`

Re-checked: `operators` is optional as a prop, but every condition ROW still
structurally carries an operator slot and the AND-chained, add/remove-row
interaction model has no analog in this app's single-valued, closed-
vocabulary facet chips (`shared/web/screen-engine/filter-bar.tsx`). Omitting
the operator list does not collapse the composition into a chip row; it just
leaves the operator dropdown emptier. A peer tested this rather than
inferring it: `operators={[]}` with one condition still renders 2
comboboxes, same as a real `operators` list — the control is there either
way, just empty. There is no escape hatch. Confirmed unchanged.

`ArchiveConfirmationDialog` (the mandatory-reason sibling of
`DeleteConfirmationDialog`) and `StepperHero` for `story-status-stepper.tsx`
(the 4-stage door mismatch) are also still real, unresolved mismatches, but
each is recorded once already — under the `[~]`/`[x]` entry for its sibling
composition — rather than duplicated here.

## [ ] No current app equivalent (3)

`templates/multi-step-form.tsx` — no wizard forms exist anywhere in the app
(also inherits the `form-screen` mismatch above). A peer's render probe adds
a second, independent confirmation: `MultiStepForm` itself warns at runtime
when no step depends on an earlier one — the kit's own component agreeing
there is no wizard here to hang it on.

`templates/search-results.tsx` — assumes a global "search everything from
anywhere" command-palette. No such control exists anywhere in either front
door; the only search-like control (`record-picker.tsx`) is a per-field
relation picker inside a form, not global search.

`overlays/quick-view.tsx` — wants a Space/click-to-peek dialog instead of
navigating. The app's real row activation
(`shared/web/screen-engine/screen-renderer.tsx:683`) is Enter/Space →
navigate straight to the full record, with no peek pattern anywhere.
Adopting this means changing established navigation behavior across the
engine, not adding a missing piece.

## [?] Needs a human call (2)

**`templates/sign-in.tsx`** — landed. The other lane shipped
`sign-in-system` (the agency login now renders the kit's `LoginRoute`
through `web/components/auth-card.tsx`) after this file's first pass flagged
the asset-import blocker as stale. See UI-GAPS.md rows 2 and 23.

**`templates/rail.tsx`** — LANDED 2026-08-31, moved out of this section (see
`[x] Adopted` above). The client compared the live app's navbar against the
kit's own reviewed `Rail` and said, verbatim, "the navbar is completely
different" — `AppShell`'s rail COLUMN was the kit's `ScreenShell` since the
earlier pass, but the nav CONTENTS were still this app's own `navButton`
function reading the same `--spine-*` tokens by hand, which is exactly what
read as a paraphrase rather than the real thing on a side-by-side. `web/components/app-shell.tsx`
now builds `railGroups`/`railMember` from the nav registry (`lib/pages.ts`)
and the signed-in user and renders the kit's `Rail` directly. The render probe
recorded here — `mark`/`wordmark`/`tagline` all take an arbitrary node — turned
out to be the wrong home for the team switcher after all: those three are the
BRAND head (and this app's `brand.name` genuinely is "kwapso", so Rail's own
default Logotype/Isotype is this app's real identity, not a placeholder), not
a workspace-switcher slot, and there is no other prop for one. The switcher is
composed ABOVE `Rail` instead — a real app-side addition beside the kit part,
not forced into a slot that doesn't fit (the report this landed under says so
explicitly). Two further findings, both worth keeping on record: (1) Rail's
`<a>` element never calls `preventDefault`, so a real in-app `href` on a
`RailItem` would hard-reload this static-export shell — every item is wired
with `onSelect` only, rendering Rail's `<button>` branch instead, same as the
hand-rolled row always was; (2) the member chip's `MemberChip` draws
`AvatarFallback` only, with no photo slot, so the user's real `imageUrl` (which
`ProfileMenu`'s own avatar already shows) has nowhere to go in Rail — a
genuine kit gap, not silently worked around. The mobile top-bar/bottom-tab-bar
stay bespoke as always: `ScreenShell` drops the rail entirely below `md` and
draws no hamburger anywhere.

**`overlays/bulk-edit.tsx`** — CORRECTED from `[ ]` to `[?]`. The first pass
said this "requires a row-selection mechanism... nothing in
`shared/web/screen-engine/` or either front door has any row-selection UI
at all... adopting this means building a cross-cutting selection primitive
first." That reason is **inverted**: `BulkEditScreen` IS the selection
primitive, not a consumer of one waiting to be built. A peer's render probe
(after first getting a false negative from `input[type=checkbox]` — the kit
uses Radix's `[role=checkbox]`, and the empty-records case renders exactly
one selection mark, the header select-all, proving the corrected selector
can actually tell a difference): the open composition renders 7 selection
marks across its own rows, and passing `selectedIds` brings up its own
"selected" panel. It brings the rows, the marks, the select-all and the
panel — nothing has to be built first. What is left is not a structural
mismatch, it's a product question this app has never been asked: does it
want bulk edit on any collection at all. Filed as a human call, not a
rejection.

## The kit's real `CollectionFrame` primitive (not a template — a component;
carried here because it is the other half of the "kit overrides the app"
ruling)

**CORRECTED blast-radius.** The first pass estimated adopting the kit's own
`components/collection-frame/collection-frame.tsx` (which draws its own
heading, tabs, 5-slot toolbar and soft-paper panel — not just the
loading/empty/error registers this app already uses via `ShapeStateBody`)
would require stripping this app's `CollectionCard` wrapper from "40+ host
call sites." That number was never checked. It is wrong: `CollectionCard` is
defined once (`web/components/deep-link/screen-bits.tsx`) and consumed at
exactly one other file, `web/components/deep-link/collection-content.tsx`
(6 call sites there, one direct and five through `SectionWithCreate`, which
always wraps in `CollectionCard`). The kit's own `CollectionFrame` component
is not adopted anywhere today — only its `CollectionRegister` sub-export is
(`web/components/agent-panel.tsx`), which is the empty/error/busy notice,
not the frame.

The owner has ruled the double-box question directly: "make the kit
override whatever we have." Given the corrected, much smaller footprint,
this is genuinely adoptable — but it is a real rewrite, not a box swap: the
kit's `CollectionFrame` fixes the toolbar's slot ORDER (search → filters →
period → view-switch → actions) and expects the header/count/tabs to be
built through its own `heading`/`count`/`tabs` props, so this app's engine
(`shared/web/screen-engine/collection-frame.tsx`) would need its search box,
`FilterBar` and `SortControl` re-plumbed into those slots (the kit's own doc
names the precedent for `SortControl` sharing the `viewSwitch` slot) rather
than the bespoke header markup it draws today. All of the DATA logic
(`selectRows`, facets, the remembered-question state) is unaffected — this
is a presentation-layer rewrite of one file, but that one file is the visual
contract of every collection screen in both doors.

**Prototyped and verified, one caller, not yet rolled out further.** Commit
`989dea7e`: a `useKitPanel` flag (default `false`) on the engine's
`CollectionFrame`, wired temporarily to the roles collection only, verified
at 390/768/1280/1920, both themes, plus a live search interaction, then
reverted so every other call site is byte-identical. Two real bugs surfaced
by the screenshots and fixed before commit: passing `config.showCount`
straight into the kit's `heading`+`count` Badge drew an ORPHANED count chip
on a title-less collection — a second count for the one collection, which is
what R16 exists to catch — and the fix's own first draft then clipped the
search input on a phone by fighting it for space inside one flex slot; both
are written up in the commit message rather than repeated here.

**A third bug, found only after the ScreenShell family landed** (commit
`ca10f067`): the planner's own flagged risk — "a collection drawn through
the kit's panel INSIDE the kit's shell is a combination neither prototype
tested" — was real. `KitCollectionFrame`'s default `tone="page"` plus its
default inset drew a visible second box once `AppShell` started nesting
this frame inside `ScreenShell`'s already off-beige, already-padded body
pane — exactly the nesting the kit's own `tone` doc names by name. Fixed
with `tone="bare"` `inset={false}`, unconditionally: this frame never
renders anywhere else in this app. Re-verified at all four widths, both
themes, after the fix.

**A fourth bug — the double-box was still real, just invisible, and a
peer's deeper detector is what caught it** (commit `230d1cfb`, verified
`230d1cfb`). The `tone="bare"` fix above stopped the FRAME's own redundant
fill, but never removed the surrounding `CollectionCard` — the app's own
`<Card>` box (`web/components/deep-link/screen-bits.tsx`'s
`SectionWithCreate`) was still wrapping the kit panel, five DOM levels
down. A peer's first probe walked only four ancestors and reported clean;
re-run unbounded with a canary nested deep enough to prove it, it found
the real nesting on both roles and tickets. It cost nothing visible
because `CollectionCard`'s fill and the kit panel's fill were the same
token (`bg-surface-panel`) — measured, not assumed: card 974px/radius
27/no shadow, panel 902px/radius 27/no shadow, 36px of dead inset between
them. Not a kit bug (the kit never composes its frame inside a `Card`; it
drops straight into `ScreenShell`'s own off-beige body, which is what
makes the panel readable at all) — the in-rule fix was always app-side,
per this entry's own first-pass reasoning. Fixed for real this time:
`SectionWithCreate` takes a `useKitPanel` prop that skips `CollectionCard`
outright. Caught a second, related bug in the same pass — with the box
gone, the header's own icon-only create button and the panel's own
labelled one were both rendering for the READY state (not the deliberately
doubled empty-state mangos) — fixed by skipping the header's button too
when `useKitPanel` is on.

**A CLAIM MADE HERE AND THEN RETRACTED, on record because the retraction
matters as much as the finding.** An earlier draft of this entry said the
invisible double box deferred a real cost — that a folder tab, if either
collection ever grew one, would lose its ground against a panel whose fill
matched it exactly, quoting the kit's own "the active folder tab has
nothing to be seen against." That was a plausible inference from the kit's
documentation about a nesting nobody had actually measured, and it was
wrong: the folder tab strip sits OUTSIDE `CollectionCard` entirely, direct
on `ScreenShell`'s off-beige body (`screen-shell-body`), and always has.
Measured on deployed staging, pre-fix, with the Card still present: active
tab fill `rgb(247,242,235)` against a `rgb(255,254,249)` ground, contrast
1.103 — the kit's own stated healthy figure — throughout. The double box
was real and worth fixing (36px of dead inset drawing a surface nobody
could see), but it was never sitting on a live contrast defect, and
nothing was going to break when a collection grew a folder tab. Say what
was wrong, not just what's fixed now.

**Verified post-fix, on real staging data (the positive control that makes
a zero mean something):** `appCardPresent=false` on both roles (974px
panel, `nested=[]`, 7 real named rows — "Admin — Default role, full
access," "Client — A client login" — one create control, "New role") and
tickets (974px panel, `nested=[]`, 50 real tickets). The panel's own width
grew from 902 to 974 — the space `CollectionCard` used to hold — confirming
it is now THE box rather than a second one hiding inside the first.

**`empty-collection`'s genuinely-empty half — ADOPTED** (commit `960ae29e`).
`states/empty-collection.tsx`'s own `emptyBody` register (Headline + Text +
Button, "left-aligned, type only… no dashed placeholder rectangle") is
assembled directly in the `useKitPanel` branch for the not-narrowed empty
case, reusing `config.emptyText` and `createAction` — nothing new needed,
which is the test the planner set for "adoption" rather than "a feature":
everything the body needs already exists. The rest of that composition
(a figure strip of zero-reading stats above the tabs, tabs carrying
zero-badges) is NOT adopted — `CollectionConfig` has no "figures" concept
and no per-tab zero-badge concept, and inventing either is real, separate
scope. Verified on `roles` with the list route-mocked to zero rows, all
four widths, both themes
(`scripts/lane-shots/verify-empty-body.mjs`). Two create buttons appear
at once (toolbar + body) — matches the composition's own documented
design ("this screen carries TWO mango actions… the header's +, which
acts on the page, and the register's Add the first"), not a bug.

**`no-results` — DELIBERATELY NOT ADOPTED this pass; here is what it would take.**
`states/no-results.tsx`'s own `emptyBody` register says three things a
plain sentence doesn't: the exact total row count, which facet is
excluding the most rows ("the narrowest" one), and how many rows would
show if just that one facet were cleared (a live "clear this one, not all
of them" number, not just the “Clear filters” button this app already
has). All three numbers are real UI value — genuinely more informative
than the current no-results sentence — but the middle one requires the
engine to answer a question it has never had to answer: for the CURRENT
combination of query + facet values, if each active facet were cleared
ONE AT A TIME, which single facet would let back in the most rows? That's
a comparison across every active facet, re-running `selectRows` per
candidate (or an equivalent shortcut), and it has real edge cases nobody
has hit yet because nothing computes it today: two facets tied for
"narrowest" (which one does the sentence name?), a facet that excludes
every remaining row on its own (would-show-if-cleared = the full
unfiltered count, which reads differently from "some but not all"), and a
search term interacting with a facet (does the recomputation re-apply the
search, or just the other facets — the sentence's grammar depends on the
answer). None of this is visible until someone hits it on a real filtered
list with more than one facet on at once. It is also not urgent:
no-results already has a working "Clear filters" button (this session's
first pass), so the current plain sentence is not a dead end, just plainer
than the kit's — "plain and correct beats rich and speculative" is the
planner's own call on the trade. Left on `ShapeStateBody` + the existing
sentence + button, unchanged, pending a dedicated pass that builds and
tests the narrowest-facet computation on its own, against real filtered
data.

## The `screens/`+`states/` lane's pass, 2026-08-29 — the pattern behind every rejection below

One sentence answers "why does the number stop" for this whole section, and
it is the same sentence four separate investigations landed on
independently: **the kit ships the general case, and this app already made
a more specific decision.** Not-found's collection stays fine while ours has
no collection to reason about; the static splash is the generic loading
answer while our animated one is a dated, owner-motivated fix; invite-
acceptance assumes nobody has an account yet while ours deliberately lets
any signed-in person see every invite waiting for them; sign-in-portal
assumes a generic client portal never shows a social row while SCOPE ch.06
is a specific, documented reason ours does. A more generic decision wearing
the kit's clothes is a downgrade even when it compiles cleanly — the test
each entry below applies is never "does the kit ship something with this
name," it is "is the kit's version the same decision as ours, or a more
generic one."

## [x] `screens/page-failure.tsx` — adopted, 2026-08-29

The portal's `session.state === "unavailable"` branch
(`web-portal/components/portal-shell.tsx`) was a hand-rolled whole-page
takeover — "We can't reach your account" + a Retry button, replacing the
entire shell. This is exactly the register `PageFailureScreen`'s doc header
names as the one case (alongside a dead session) that law 4 allows to
replace the frame at all, and its `500` variant's shape (headline, body,
one paper "Reload" action) matched the hand-built version's intent line for
line. Swapped in `variant="500"` with the existing copy passed through as
`labels`, `onAction={refresh}`; kept the outer centring wrapper as-is since
the composition itself is only the card, not a page layout.

## States (4) — routed to `screens_detail_charts`, findings recorded 2026-08-29

The screens/states brief described the four `states/` compositions as
"nearly done — empty-collection and no-results already draw through
ShapeStateBody and simply are not imported by name." Reading the actual call
sites shows that undersells what's really there and oversells what a fix
would cost:

**`states/empty-collection.tsx` (`EmptyCollectionScreen`) and
`states/no-results.tsx` (`NoResultsScreen`)** — `ShapeStateBody`
(`shared/ui/compositions/states/states.tsx`) genuinely IS wired into
`shared/web/screen-engine/collection-frame.tsx` today, for loading, error,
and the empty/no-results split (`filtered` is exactly that switch) — this
part is real, working, and not aspirational. But `EmptyCollectionScreen` and
`NoResultsScreen` themselves — the standalone whole-screen compositions with
their own figures, tabs, rail and `onExport` prop — are unimported anywhere
in `web/` or `web-portal/` (confirmed by grep: both symbols appear only
inside their own files and the `states/index.ts` barrel). Reaching them
would mean editing `collection-frame.tsx` itself, which is the shared engine
seam `screens_detail_charts` owns — not an import to add from outside it.

**`states/archive.tsx` (`ArchiveScreen`)** is not a screen this app can swap
in in place of one file: "archive" here is a *tab* embedded separately
inside 20+ collection screens (`tickets-collection.tsx`, `work-panels.tsx`,
`account-detail-panels.tsx`, `contact-detail.tsx`, and others), each
swapping its own columns/rows in place. `ArchiveScreen` itself has zero call
sites outside its own module.

**UPDATE, prototyped on Tickets — one real piece of it IS one seam.**
`ArchiveScreen`'s composed structure is really three separable laws: (1) a
one-line "band" stating archiving's consequences, inside the panel above
the toolbar (the kit's own `band` slot — its doc names `states/archive.tsx`
as the only composition that draws one); (2) archived rows going quiet in
ink only (secondary/tertiary, no strikethrough); (3) the Status/Updated →
Archived by/Archived column swap. Only (1) is generic — it needs nothing
the engine doesn't already have. Added as a new `band` prop on
`CollectionFrame`'s `useKitPanel` branch (and threaded through
`ScreenRendererProps`/`renderList`), wired temporarily to Tickets'
already-existing Archived tab (`helpScope === "archived"`, itself a
pre-existing, working, server-backed scope — not new), verified rendering
correctly with no double-box even nested inside the kit's own shell (the
third combination of the day: archive band + kit frame + kit shell), then
reverted for the prototype commit (`a4548833`). **Turned on for real on
Tickets** in a follow-up commit (`4c1d2f9d`) — `useKitPanel` and the band
are now live on `tickets-collection.tsx`, verified at all four widths, both
themes, on both the All-tickets and Archived tabs (the band wraps to three
clean lines on a phone with no clipping).

(2) and (3) are confirmed, not assumed, to be per-collection surgery: both
need each collection's own `renderItems`/column definitions to know it's
rendering the archived view and style/reshape accordingly — Tickets'
own fields partly live in a recipe in `web/lib/screens.ts` (a different
lane's file), and every one of the 20+ collections defines its columns
differently. Stopped here per the planner's own condition ("if the rollout
starts needing per-screen surgery rather than one seam change, stop and
tell me") rather than open dozens of files to chase full parity with the
composition. The band is real and now live on Tickets; the other 19
archive tabs can adopt the same `band` prop later with no new engine work,
which is what makes it a seam rather than a one-off. (2)/(3) are not built
and would be a deliberate, scoped, per-collection decision — not a batch
item.

**`states/new-empty-record.tsx` (`NewEmptyRecordScreen`)** has no standalone
screen to replace at all — every record-detail file
(`role-detail.tsx`, `sprint-detail.tsx`, `story-detail.tsx`,
`app-detail.tsx`, `meeting-detail.tsx`, `task-detail.tsx`,
`selectable-detail.tsx`, `knowledge-detail.tsx`, and others) hand-rolls its
own `copy={{ emptyTitle: … }}` into its own `CollectionFrame`/
`ShapeStateBody` call. The register it would replace is scattered across as
many files as there are record types, all inside `screens_detail_charts`'s
territory.

## Screens (1) — `screens/not-found.tsx` mismatch, found 2026-08-29

`NotFoundScreen` is built for one specific register: a URL for **one record**
that was deleted, moved, or never existed **inside an otherwise-fine
collection** — its own doc header states this three times ("the collection
is fine — one record inside it is not," "the frame stays drawn... because
the collection is fine," law 4's "only a whole-page failure... may replace
the frame"). Every prop follows from that: a `record` number said twice (a
chip and a sentence), a real collection eyebrow/count, the collection's own
Export and create actions staying drawn in the header.

The app's actual `<NotFound />` (`web/components/deep-link/screen-bits.tsx`)
is called from a different failure entirely: `module-content.tsx` and
`collection-content.tsx` reach it when a URL segment names no module at all,
or when `resolveRecipe()` returns nothing for a module that has no detail
recipe configured — i.e. there is no collection to speak of, fine or
otherwise, so there is nothing to put in the composition's eyebrow, count,
or header actions. Forcing the swap would mean inventing collection context
that doesn't exist at these call sites. Left as-is; `screens/page-failure.tsx`
(below) is the composition that actually matches a case in this app.

## [!] `screens/splash.tsx` and `screens/portal-boot.tsx` — mismatch, found 2026-08-29

Both compositions' "booting" register is `SignInSplash`
(`compositions/templates/sign-in.tsx`) — confirmed by reading it: a static
centred mark on a field, explicitly "NO ANIMATION. It hands over; it does
not fade. Nothing here imports `motion/` and nothing sets a transition,"
and "this screen IS the loading state... no spinner, no progress bar."

This app's actual boot screen, `shared/web/mark-loader.tsx` (`MarkLoader`,
used by both `web/` and `web-portal/`), is a deliberately more capable
system the kit's static mark does not model at all: a continuously looping
SVG animation published once as `window.__ksMark` and driven by an inline
pre-hydration script so the mark is moving before the React bundle even
arrives, plus `useMarkHold` — a fix, dated 26 Aug 2026, for an owner-reported
bug ("the animation does not get a chance to complete") that holds the
loader on screen until the animation reaches a real stopping point rather
than being torn off mid-frame. The file's own history describes removing a
*second*, competing splash overlay that used to run alongside this one for
exactly the double-render/frame-rate cost swapping back in a second static
splash would reintroduce. Adopting `SignInSplash` here would be a visible
regression against two documented, deliberate fixes — not a lateral swap.

`portal-boot.tsx`'s other half (`PortalIndexRoute`'s `boot="failed"` case,
`ShapeStateBody` with `shape="portalHome"`) models the same real condition
`web-portal/components/portal-shell.tsx`'s `session.state === "unavailable"`
already covers — and that branch is now `screens/page-failure.tsx` (see
above), adopted because chapter 21's own law names it as the one register
built for "app could not draw a frame at all." Two kit chapters offer two
different answers for the same failure; `page-failure` was already chosen
on the more specific textual match ("only a whole-page failure... may
replace the frame") and general-page-failure `PageFailureScreen`'s three-
case coverage in this app. Not re-litigated here without a reason to prefer
the other.

## [!] `screens/invite-acceptance.tsx` — mismatch, found 2026-08-29

The composition's own doc header states the model it assumes: an
unauthenticated person clicks an emailed invite link, lands on ONE screen
naming that single invite (who invited them, into which account, what
role), and pressing Accept "goes straight into onboarding (27.14) with the
name and email already filled from the invite" — no account exists yet at
the point this screen is shown.

This app's real invite flow is a deliberately different shape, stated in
`web/components/invitations.tsx`'s own comment: "The fix for 'I was invited
but have no way to see/accept it': this works for ANY signed-in user, not
just a teamless one at onboarding." A person signs in first, however they
like (Google or email+code, at whatever address), lands in the app, and
`InvitationsScreen`/`InvitationsPanel` (`web/app/invitations/page.tsx`,
"where the invite email's 'Join' button lands") shows an INBOX of every
pending invite for that address — plural, post-authentication, no
onboarding hand-off. The kit's single-invite pre-account screen and this
app's authenticated multi-invite inbox are different products, not two
renderings of the same one.

## [!] `screens/link-sent.tsx` — mismatch, found 2026-08-29

Built entirely around a magic link: "We sent you a link," opened on
possibly a different device, "works once and expires in 15 minutes," with
a live resend countdown and no code to type anywhere.

This app's sign-in (`shared/web/use-email-sign-in.ts`, driving both
`web/components/auth-card.tsx` and `web-portal/components/sign-in.tsx`)
sends a 6-digit CODE, typed into a field on the same device, in the same
form the email step was submitted from — there is no separate device, no
link to click, and no "waiting room" screen at all: the UI swaps straight
from the email field to a code field on the same screen. Every one of
27.17's stated behaviors (open-elsewhere-and-land-where-you-left-off,
one-time link, no code) describes a mechanism this app does not have.

## [!] `screens/session-expired.tsx` — mismatch, found 2026-08-29, not built

Unlike the rest of this section, this is not a "the app already made a more
specific decision" case — there is no current app equivalent to compare
against at all, and the reason is that giving it one is real, unstarted
plumbing on the AUTH path, the one path where a half-built screen locks
somebody out of their own account. Three blockers, in the order they were
found:

1. Nothing persists the signed-out user's email anywhere. The composition's
   whole point is a pre-filled `email` field ("we know who it was"), but
   `web/lib/use-active-team.ts`'s 401 branch clears the session cache and
   redirects to `/login` — by the time a screen could read it, it is gone.
2. No `returnTo`/`redirectTo` mechanism exists anywhere in the login flow —
   checked `web/app/login/page.tsx`, `web/components/auth-card.tsx`, and
   `shared/web/use-email-sign-in.ts`. The composition's destination chip and
   "back to where you were" promise has nothing to restore TO.
3. The destination chip wants a friendly record title
   (`destinationTitle`), and `use-active-team.ts` runs generically on every
   page — it has no per-page context to derive one from.

The app's current behaviour (silent redirect on a genuine 401; the session
cache is deliberately KEPT on a mere outage, since a 500 is not a sign-out —
see that file's own comment) is correct and is not being touched. If this
screen is wanted, it is a scoped brief of its own — storage for the last
identity, a redirect-back contract the whole login flow has to honour, and a
decision about the destination title — not an adoption to fold into a batch.

## [!] `screens/sign-in-portal.tsx` — a decision for the owner, not a rejection, found 2026-08-29

Everything except one line is a clean fit: two-step email→code flow, one
mango Continue, resend with a live countdown, "Wrong address?" back — all of
it maps directly onto what `shared/web/use-email-sign-in.ts` already
provides, the same pattern `sign-in-system` already proved for the agency
door.

The one line is real and it is a law, not a missing prop: `PortalLoginRoute`
states "there is never a social sign-in row: the account is the company's,
not a Google profile's," and does not even expose a `providers` prop —
only the lower-level `SignIn` template does. `web-portal/components/
sign-in.tsx` offers Google today, on purpose, and says why in its own
comment: "signing in with Google never creates access; the invite does"
(SCOPE ch.06) — Google proves identity, the invite still gates access
either way, so a provider row creates nothing a code doesn't already grant.

Passing `providers` through the lower `SignIn` template to route around
`PortalLoginRoute`'s law would work, and that is exactly why it was not
done: it would leave the app quietly contradicting a rule the kit states out
loud, with nothing anywhere recording that a decision had been made. A
deviation nobody can find is worse than a mismatch everybody can read. Kept
as-is, recorded as a question the owner may want to answer once, in one
word: the kit says a client portal never shows a social sign-in row; this
app ships Google on the portal per SCOPE ch.06 because it proves identity
without granting access. Keep ours, or change the kit's law?

## [!] `screens/sign-in.tsx` (`AuthShell` + `SignInScreen`) — mismatch, found 2026-08-29

Two exports, both accounted for without adopting either.

`SignInScreen` is the same magic-link assumption `link-sent.tsx` already
failed on, and its own doc header says so directly: "one field, magic link,
password behind a text link, no social row, no code step" (logged in the
kit's own source as T3A-3). This app has no magic link and no password —
the six-digit code step this composition explicitly omits is the one this
app's entire sign-in depends on. `templates/sign-in.tsx`'s `SignIn` is the
kit's OTHER shell, the one WITH a code step, and it is what both of this
app's real doors actually render through (`sign-in-system`, adopted; the
question on `sign-in-portal` is above) — this file's own header even flags
the two shells as an unresolved drift inside the kit itself (T3A-2).

`AuthShell`, the shared two-panel shell the file also exports, has exactly
three consumers in the kit: `link-sent.tsx`, `invite-acceptance.tsx`, and
`session-expired.tsx` (`sign-in-portal.tsx` uses the other family). All
three are recorded above as a mismatch or explicitly not built this pass —
so `AuthShell` has no live route in this app to stand under regardless of
whether it is itself adoptable.

## Components (KIT-COVERAGE.md's checklist, from screens_collections's pass)

Findings from a bottom-up component sweep (Detail and examples, Collection
views, Forms and data, Notes and notifications, Feedback and overlay, Data
display), reported by a peer for this file since it now covers the whole
catalogue's "why not," not just the 23 compositions it started with.

**Shipped, not a finding:** `brand` — `web-portal/components/portal-shell.tsx`
now renders the kit's real `Logotype`/`AuthPhotograph` instead of the
`auth-artwork.tsx` shim, verified by probe-compile after UI-GAPS row 23's
asset-url fix landed. Committed `2eebb832`.

**Confirmed mismatches:**
- `form` — CONFIRMED, on a sharper reason than the first pass gave. Not
  just "a second seam for a role `FormShell` already fills" (a preference,
  which a newer export could in principle change): `FormShell` renders its
  own `<form onSubmit>`, and the kit's `Form` IS a `<form>` element too.
  Nesting two `<form>` elements is invalid HTML regardless of any prop —
  `hideActions` silences `Form`'s own save bar, not its root element, so
  there is no configuration that avoids it. A parser fact, not a
  preference, on record so a later reader doesn't wonder if a newer `Form`
  changed the calculus.
- `import-wizard` — the same "one file, one table, manual column mapping"
  mismatch already on record for the import trio, one primitive layer
  down (`ImportWizard` composes `Form`+`Field`+`Select` for the mapping
  step this app's agentic import has no place for).
- `progress`, `progress-dashboard` — `pulse.tsx`'s own locked law ("big
  NUMBER or CHART, nothing else") already cited for `stat-strip`, ruling
  out a third shape. No progress-bar/dashboard concept exists anywhere in
  the app's savings/hours/margin screens.
- `notifications` — no bell/inbox concept anywhere in either front door
  (grepped both). This app's live-update model is realtime in-place sync,
  not a notification log. A real gap, but a new FEATURE, not a swap.
- `tree`, `stopwatch` — no current app equivalent (no hierarchical UI
  outside the already-adopted flowchart/process-maps; work logs are
  entered retrospectively, never clocked).
- Most of Collection views (kanban, calendar-view, spreadsheet, matrix,
  swimlane, timeline, agenda, split, queue, chat, tiles, map, compare,
  flowdetail, copilot-overlay — ~15 types) — no current app equivalent.
  The recipe engine's view-type union has a fixed set (list/table,
  card-grid, activity-feed, etc.) and none of these has an obvious
  existing collection to attach to. This was an architecture-level read
  (the engine's own type union), not a per-composition render — flagged as
  worth a second look if anyone disagrees with treating it as one category
  rather than individual verdicts.

**`gallery` — ADOPTED, and the exception the batch above already flagged.**
This one WAS actually rendered before being decided, and it turned out to
be the correct exception: `brandListRecipe` (`web/lib/screens.ts`) drew
every image in the brand library — headshots, logos, colour swatches — as
a text row, a genuine, visible defect rather than a missing view type.
Added `display: "gallery"` to the recipe engine's display union
(`shared/web/screen-engine/recipe.ts`), alongside a new `image` field
(a plain URL column, deliberately distinct from `leading`'s already-
rendered `mark` node — `Gallery` needs the raw `src` to draw its own
no-picture register for a colour asset that has none). Verified live at
all four widths, both themes — real photos render as real tiles,
letterboxed per the composition's 16:9-contain law; colour swatches (no
file, by construction) correctly fall through to the title-on-soft-paper
register; narrow width drops to one column below 420, matching CH27.28's
own figure. Commit `095484de`.

**Not a real gap:** `notes` reads `[ ]` in KIT-COVERAGE.md but is a census
blind spot — `Comments` (already `[x]`) imports `Notes` internally
(`shared/ui/components/comments/comments.tsx:87`) and is built directly on
top of it. The coverage script only counts direct import strings, so it
can't see a transitive one. Worth a rot-check-style note if the script ever
grows a "transitively used" column.

**Too big for a same-session swap, flagged for its own dedicated pass:**
`detail-view` — a whole "record overview panel" primitive (header + avatar
+ kv + sections + aside + footer). Adopting it for real would mean
restructuring the many hand-composed `*-detail.tsx` files, which might
genuinely reduce real duplication but is scoped work, not a batch item. Not
picked up this pass.

**`checklist` — UPGRADED to `[~]` adoptable, partial, on a re-render.** Two
candidates, and the first render (props-table only) missed a real opt-out:
- `tasks-screen.tsx`'s "Ours to do" list (real staff tasks, genuine
  tick-to-complete via `task-detail.tsx`'s `onToggleDone`) is closer in
  interaction spirit but already deliberately richer than `checklist`'s
  fixed 5-column row (mark/number/title/owner/when): six server-driven view
  tabs with exact R14/R16 counts, priority, assignee, department glyph, due
  date. `checklist` has no slot for most of that — adopting it would be a
  downgrade, not a fit. Still held.
- `work-panels.tsx`'s `TodosPanel` (client to-dos): the first pass assumed
  omitting `onToggle` still left an INTERACTIVE-looking control that would
  lie about who can press it. Re-rendered rather than assumed: omitting
  `onToggle` makes the whole row read-only — `checklist.tsx`'s own words,
  "no mark is interactive" — and produces a real disabled, `aria-checked`,
  `aria-readonly` mark, not a control in disguise. That fits `TodosPanel`'s
  DONE pile exactly, which is already read-only and action-less today (a
  "Done" badge, nothing to press). A real limit surfaced on the same render:
  the row has no trailing-action slot at all, so it does NOT fit the OPEN
  pile, which needs a Withdraw button per row. Not implemented — splitting
  one panel's two tabs into two different row shapes (`checklist` for done,
  something else for open) is a product call about consistency within one
  screen, not a rendering question, and is flagged rather than decided here.

The rest of the batch is filed in the same bucket as most of Collection
views.

`screen-renderer` and `collection-frame` are left alone here — the app's
own files under those names do a different job from their kit namesakes
(see the warning at the top of this file), and `collection-frame` is the
subject of this file's own `useKitPanel` prototype above.

### Folder shapes, Navigation, Filter and search, Tables and lists

Picked up by a peer after finishing their assigned six and confirming the
top ten were someone else's — nobody had explicitly owned these four
groups.

**Another census blind spot**, same shape as `notes`→`Comments`: `folder`
shows unchecked but `tabs.tsx` (already `[x]`) imports it internally for
the `variant="folder"` tab strip already in use
(`web/components/deep-link/screen-bits.tsx`'s `SectionWithCreate`,
`folderTabs` slot). Already adopted, just not directly.

**No current need**, not a mismatch: `breadcrumb` (the composable 7-part
version) — this app has exactly one `Breadcrumbs` call site
(`web/components/app-shell.tsx`), a plain URL-derived array with no
per-crumb customization, and the already-adopted `breadcrumbs` one-prop
wrapper handles it completely. The lower-level parts exist for a Next
`<Link>` via `asChild`, a mark, or a non-route step — none apply here.

**Confirmed mismatch, same family already documented:** `data-preview-table`
— `DataTable` plus per-row confidence/error marks for a single-table
import review. `web/components/import-screen.tsx` has no table at all in
its review step (Badge-only, card-based), consistent with
AGENTIC-IMPORT.md's real shape (multi-table, agent-proposed, FK-resolved) —
one more layer down on the same root mismatch as the import trio.

**No fit, three considered:** `visibility` (`VisibilityProvider`/
`useIsVisible`, a shared `IntersectionObserver`). The kit's own three
stated use cases are each already handled a different way here: `Image`/
`Video` use native `loading="lazy"`, not this hook (confirmed neither
imports it internally, so no transitive adoption either); long collections
use explicit `LoadMore` buttons, not scroll-triggered pagination (a
deliberate UX choice, not a gap); no scroll-triggered animations exist to
pause.

**`use-virtual-rows` — SHIPPED** (commit `9ec3efcf`). The candidate above
was verified against real data rather than wired in blind:
`web/components/selectable-screen.tsx` now windows a dropdown-values group
once it crosses 100 rows — per GROUP, not per screen, since the hook
assumes one uniform row height across whatever list it's handed, and this
screen's groups (one per vocabulary type) are the uniform grain, the whole
screen is not. Load-tested against a team seeded with real volume before
shipping, which is exactly the load-testing this entry originally asked
for before wiring it in.

TOOLING NOTE, worth keeping for the next scroll/animation/rAF-dependent
check: the Browser pane throttles a hidden/backgrounded tab hard enough
that `requestAnimationFrame` never fires — silently, no error, the checked
behaviour just never happens. Neither overriding `document.hidden`/
`visibilityState` nor patching `window.requestAnimationFrame` gets past
it; the throttle is enforced below what a page can see or override. A real
Playwright browser (`scripts/verify-virtual-scroll.mjs`, kept in the repo)
is what actually proved the scroll-triggered windowing works. A peer hit
the same constraint the same day verifying a closed Popover that looked
"stuck open" in the pane — really just a canary animation with no rAF
ticking, not a real bug — so this is the second investigation it has
silently cost, worth naming here rather than let a third rediscover it.

## The remaining `screens/`+`states/` compositions — a kit-side sweep, 2026-08-29

Only one `screens/` file (`not-found.tsx`, above) and the four `states/`
files this lane's own `useKitPanel` entry already covers had been looked at
before today, out of 18 `screens/` + 5 `states/` = 23 total — the rest sat
uncovered, on neither side. A peer swept all 23 from the KIT side (rendered
every one, not read the props table) and reports it here rather than commit
it, since this file has one owner. The headline: **there is no kit-side
blocker in any of the 23.**

- **Required props:** of 23 files, exactly two exported components have
  one — `settings.tsx`'s `AppearanceOptionGroup` (`options`, a
  sub-primitive, not the route itself) and `states.tsx`'s `ShapeStateBody`
  (`shape`, `state` — the shared register this file's own adoptions already
  use internally). All 18 `screens/` compositions take ZERO required props.
  None demands a data shape this app would have to invent — the exact
  discriminator that killed the import trio and `bulk-edit`'s original
  (wrong) reason elsewhere in this file.
- **All 23 render** from `{}` alone, 3–57KB of markup each, and survive all
  four state registers (loading/error/empty/ready) — a 188-render sweep,
  not a spot check.
- **No unreachable copy.** A hardcoded-string census across all 47
  compositions found three offenders (`home`, `onboarding`,
  `sign-in-system`) — all in this set, all fixed upstream in kit v1.2.4.
  Nothing else here writes a sentence this app couldn't translate, so
  R28/R33 blocks none of the 23.
- **No doc-vs-implementation contradictions** — the same census found one
  across all 47 (`access-denied`'s `grantor` default), already fixed and
  already folded into this file above.
- Eleven of the 23 accept `rail` (the `rail={null}` opt-out this file
  already verified applies identically); seventeen have a `labels`/`copy`
  seam.

**One caveat left for a human, not fixed upstream:** `settings.tsx` renders
"Record title" and "Status · 4 open" as literal English inside its
text-size preview thumbnail. It's `aria-hidden="true"` (a screen reader
never meets it — the kit is asserting "this is a picture of type, not
words"), but a reader using any other language SEES it. Whether a type
specimen is copy or decoration is a real design call, defensible either
way — left for the owner, not fixed on one engineer's judgement. Worth a
line here if `settings` is ever adopted.

**What this is not:** not "adopt all 23." Several are product decisions
(a brand reference page, a company hub, an archive band screen) for the
owner, not a rendering question, and portal sign-in already has a named
conflict elsewhere in this file. What the sweep settles is narrower: for
these 23, there is nothing left to DISCOVER on the kit side, so nobody has
to re-derive it, and any blocker that surfaces during actual adoption is
kit-side to fix the same day rather than app-side to work around.

**The two probes are available on request.** Nested-same-tone-surface
detection (the double-box class of bug this file's own `useKitPanel` entry
found and fixed by hand) and accessible-name-from-the-browser's-own-
computation, both carrying an injected canary so a zero-result actually
means something. `useKitPanel` is now live on one real collection (roles,
`65728b64`) — worth pointing both probes at it rather than leaving that
offer unused.

A recorded mismatch is a result, not a stall. Without this list, the next
lane (or the next session) re-reads all 23 signatures from zero and either
re-discovers the same reasons or — worse — forces one of them, because
"nobody wrote down why not" reads identically to "nobody checked." The
2026-08-29 correction is the same argument turned on the record itself:
stale verdicts are why the peer flagged this file for a re-read rather than
treating it as settled, and updating it in place (rather than appending a
second opinion beside the first) is what keeps that true going forward.
