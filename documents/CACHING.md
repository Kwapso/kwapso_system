# Caching, the system-wide ruleset (LOCKED 2026-06-15; ROW-LEVEL live-sync added 2026-06-22; agent-modules resources added 2026-06-23)

How the Kwapso System (and every app built on this base) caches data on the client. These
rules make caching **safe** because the live channel keeps it honest: you never
sit on stale data, and a cache can never hold something you're not allowed to
see. Follow them for every new screen and module.

The whole layer is tiny and dependency-free:
- [`shared/web/store.ts`](../shared/web/store.ts), the cache + `useCached` / `invalidate` /
  `primeCache`, plus `patchRow` (row-level: patch ONE row in a cached list) and
  `reconcile` (reconnect catch-up: diff-patch a whole list back in place).
- [`shared/web/realtime.ts`](../shared/web/realtime.ts), the live channel client. A browser
  opens **two** sockets: the active **team** channel and its **own user** channel.
- [`shared/workers/realtime.ts`](../shared/workers/realtime.ts), the publish side:
  `publishChange` (team channel), `publishUserChange` (one user's devices),
  `publishSignOut` (forced sign-out).

### The publish contract, what the three functions promise

`publishChange` is named in ten documents and is the thing Law R1 is about, so its
contract belongs in one place rather than being inferred from ten call sites. **This
is that place.**

```ts
publishChange(env, teamId, resource, id, op, scope)  // → the TEAM channel
publishUserChange(env, userId, resource, id?, op?)   // → one person's devices
publishSignOut(env, userId)                          // → forced sign-out
```

All three take the worker's **whole `env`**, not the `REALTIME` binding on its own
(`RealtimeEnv = { REALTIME, INTERNAL_KEY? }`). That is deliberate: the shared internal
key the realtime worker checks travels with the call, so a publisher that forgets it is
a type error here rather than a silent 403 at runtime.

| Argument | What it must be |
|---|---|
| `resource` | the STRING the client registry keys on, a `TEAM_RESOURCES` entry, a `SIMPLE_INVALIDATIONS` entry, or a reasoned `DEAF_EXEMPT` line (Law **R15**: a publisher with no listener is a screen that stales). Conventionally the table name (`member_roles`, `help`, `brand_assets`). |
| `id` | the affected ROW's id, so the client can patch just that row (rule 3). **The one deliberate exception is a bulk write**, which publishes ONE id-less ping on the target table and lets the client reconcile the list, one ping, never one per row. |
| `op` | `add` · `edit` · `remove`. It drives the count sidecar (`add`/`remove` bump `total` by ±1) and nothing else, the client re-pulls the row through the gated endpoint either way, so a wrong `op` costs an off-by-one badge until the next reconcile, never wrong data. |
| `scope` | the ACCOUNT the row belongs to, on `publishChange` only. Pass it for anything a client login is meant to hear: a portal socket is fenced by account and cannot check a row id, so a ping with no scope is one their side never receives. |

Four promises the callers rely on and must not break:

1. **It carries no row CONTENT**, ever (rule 8). The ping says *that* something
   changed, never *what*. This is what lets the socket be safe for every member of a
   team regardless of their module rights.
2. **It is fire-and-forget and MUST NOT be able to fail the write.** A realtime
   hiccup is a stale screen for one revalidation cycle; a realtime hiccup that rolled
   back a committed write would be a data-loss bug caused by a cache layer. Same
   best-effort contract as activity writes and notification emails
   (ERROR-HANDLING.md).
3. **It goes AFTER the write commits**, not beside it. A ping the client acts on
   before the row exists re-pulls the old row and patches the stale value in, which
   looks exactly like the write silently failing.
4. **Zero rows moved means no ping** (Law **R17**). An idempotent transition that
   changed nothing publishes nothing and writes no activity row, so a double-click
   is one event in the history and one ping on the wire.

The seam test (`workers/*/test/publish-seam.test.ts`) reads handler source off disk
and turns the build red if a route classified `mutation` contains none of the three
calls, so the contract above is what you are agreeing to when you classify a route.

## The rules

### 1 · Cache-first reads (stale-while-revalidate)
Every list/record read shows the cached copy **instantly** and revalidates in
the background. First view = skeleton; every revisit = instant.

```tsx
const membersQ = useCached(`members:${teamId}`, () =>
  tenancy.members().then((r) => r.members)
)
// membersQ.data is the cached value (or undefined on a true first load)
```

### 2 · Key by SCOPE + resource (+ id)
Team data is keyed `resource:<teamId>` (or `resource:<rowId>`); identity data
(yours across devices) is keyed by the user, e.g. `account-activity`,
`invitations`. **Never** share a key across teams, switching teams uses
different keys, so one team's data can't leak into another's view.

```
members:<teamId>     member_roles:<teamId>   my-perms:<teamId>   invites:<teamId>
role-perms:<roleId>  invite-audit:<inviteId> activity:user:<userId>  account-activity
```

### 3 · ROW-LEVEL live updates, patch the changed row, never refetch the list
A write publishes a ping `{ resource, id, op }`; the client re-pulls **just that
one row** through the gated single-row endpoint and patches it into the cached
list in place (`patchRow`), it does **not** refetch the whole collection. The
single-row read passes the **same server filter** as the list, so a row that no
longer belongs (deactivated member, etc.) comes back `null` and is dropped. One
mechanism covers add / edit / remove / soft-delete. A full-collection refetch
happens only on **first load** and **team switch**.

The client handler is **registry-driven**, not a per-resource `switch`: adding a
module = one entry in `TEAM_RESOURCES` (`web/lib/live-resources.ts`, moved out of
app-shell so the R15 `live-collections` check imports it as data). Two channels:

```ts
// worker, after a successful write — carry the affected row id:
await publishChange(env, guard.teamId, "member_roles", roleId, "edit")

// client registry (app-shell.tsx) — one line per module, generic handler:
member_roles: {
  key: (t) => `member_roles:${t}`,
  idField: "id",
  fetchOne: (id) => tenancy.role(id),         // gated single-row read
  fetchList: () => tenancy.roles()...,        // used by reconnect catch-up
  deps: (t, id) => [`my-perms:${t}`, `role-perms:${id}`], // small derived caches
}
```

Relative times, "N members" and other derived text **recompute client-side**
from the patched rows. But a **count BADGE is NOT one of these** (LAW R16): a
capped list's length is a ceiling, not a total, so every list door returns its
exact server `COUNT(*)` (`total`; help also `mineTotal`) and the client keeps it
in a `total:<prefix>:<teamId>` cache sidecar, primed by the list fetchers,
bumped ±1 by an `add`/`remove` ping, re-primed on reconnect, rendered through the
one `shared/web/format-count.ts` seam. Never `rows.length`.

**No deaf publishers, no deaf paged screens (LAW R15).** Every resource string a
worker publishes must reach a listener: a `TEAM_RESOURCES` row-level entry, a
coarse `SIMPLE_INVALIDATIONS` entry (team meta, screen recipes), or a reasoned
`DEAF_EXEMPT` line in the rules registry (today: `help_threads`, `agent_usage`).
The `selectable_data` manager was a deaf listener before R15, its worker pinged
and nothing heard, so it now has a row-level entry. A paged screen needs nothing
extra: paging moved to opaque cursors over the SHARED STORE, so its rows live in a
cache key with the cursor in a sidecar, the very caches the registry patches. (It
used to need a fan-out bus feeding a `useLiveRefetch` subscription, because page
state sat outside the caches. That premise went away, so R15's paged-screen clause
was retired and `web/lib/use-live-refetch.ts` deleted; the bus that fed it,
`web/lib/live-bus.ts`, outlived its only subscriber and is now gone too. See
RULES.md R15.)

### 4 · Every mutation publishes (structurally can't-forget)
Every state-changing route broadcasts a change ping, it is **not** per-call
discipline. In the tenancy worker each route is classified `read` / `mutation` /
`housekeeping` in a declarative table (`ROUTES` in `index.ts`), and a guard test
(`publish-seam.test.ts`) turns the build **red** if a `mutation` doesn't publish
or a new route is left unclassified. The only writes that broadcast nothing are
the explicit housekeeping deny-list (a private session pointer, ops-only admin
actions), matching login_codes / sessions / db_alerts / the nightly size cron.

### 5 · Identity scope, your changes follow YOU everywhere
Identity is read fresh from one global `users` row wherever it's shown, so a
name/photo edit fans out on **two** axes: `publishUserChange(userId, "profile")`
refreshes your own devices, and a `members` ping on **every team you belong to**
refreshes how others see your member row. Cross-team membership (joined / removed
/ new team) rides your **user** channel (`teams` event) so the switcher updates
without that team's socket. A forced sign-out is a `session` event on the user
channel (other devices re-check auth, dead ones bounce to login).

### 6 · Reconnect re-syncs (no missed changes after a drop)
After a dropped socket reconnects, the client doesn't trust that it saw every
ping: it **diff-patches** each on-screen list back in place (`reconcile` re-pulls
the list, updates changed rows, adds new ones, drops gone ones, keeping unchanged
rows' identity so only real changes re-render) and refreshes the small derived
caches. No page reload.

### 7 · Mutations prime the cache (instant for the actor)
After a write, drop the fresh result straight in, so the person who made the
change sees it with **zero refetch**; everyone else gets the ping (rules 3–6).

```ts
const { members } = await tenancy.setMemberRole(userId, roleId)
primeCache(`members:${teamId}`, members)   // instant for the actor
```

### 8 · Pings carry "what", never the content
The ping says only `{ resource, id, op }`, that a row of some resource changed,
never the row's CONTENT. (The id/op/timing ARE visible to anyone already on the
channel, which is exactly why the socket itself is gated at connect, rule 5.)
The re-pull then goes through the normal **permission-checked endpoint**, so a
cache can never hold data the viewer isn't allowed to see. (A viewer with no
rights simply gets nothing back.)

### 9 · Lifetime: in-memory per session, and **BOUNDED** (scaling review 2026-08-14)
The cache lives in module memory. Cross-reload persistence of FETCHED data stays
off on purpose, the live channel keeps it correct while the tab is open. (Unsaved
FORM INPUT is different: it DOES persist to `sessionStorage` so a half-filled form
survives navigation. See §11.)

**It has three ceilings and an eviction rule.** This section used to say the cache
was "cleared on sign-out / team switch (different keys)", and neither half was true:
nothing cleared it, and *different keys* is not *dropped keys*. It was a plain `Map`
that only ever grew, no size bound, no maximum age, nothing removed at the identity
boundary. The user this whole document is written for keeps one tab open for a
working day, so a morning of navigation accumulated every list ever opened (up to
`LIST_HARD_CAP` rows each) plus every page `<LoadMore>` had ever appended, and a
signed-out tab could still paint a member list out of memory.

| bound | value | why this one |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_CACHED_KEYS` | 120 | how many collections are remembered at once, tens is a real day's navigation, hundreds is accumulation |
| `MAX_CACHED_ROWS` | 20,000 | the number that actually costs memory: one paged feed scrolled all day can hold more rows than forty ordinary lists |
| `MAX_CACHE_AGE_MS` | 10 min | a floor under freshness that does **not** depend on a ping arriving. The socket *will* drop in an eight-hour session (§6 catches up when it notices; this catches what it never noticed) |

- **Eviction never takes a subscribed key.** A key with a mounted reader is on
  screen, and dropping it to make room for one nobody is reading would blank a live
  list. The sweep skips subscribed keys and takes the least-recently-written of the
  rest, which is exactly the set a day's navigation left behind.
- **`clearCache()` at the identity boundary.** Sign-out, team switch (agency) and
  company switch (portal) all drop everything and notify, so a mounted screen
  re-reads through the permission-checked door. The portal's company switch used to
  name nine cache keys one at a time, each added after somebody spotted a stale
  screen, which is the hand-kept-list shape R21 has been bitten by twice. A switch
  changes *who is asking*; nothing cached survives it.
- **A read does not refresh age.** The clock starts at the WRITE, or a screen
  polling its own cache would keep stale rows alive for ever.

Locked by `web/test/cache-bounds.test.ts` and
`web-portal/test/switcher-invalidation.test.ts`.

### 10 · Edge / server
- Content-hashed assets (`/_next/static/**`) → cached **forever, immutable**
  (set in [`web/public/_headers`](../web/public/_headers)).
- HTML → revalidated (`max-age=0, must-revalidate`).
- Per-user API responses → **private, never edge-cached**. The client cache
  (rules 1–9) handles them.

### 11 · Form drafts (unsaved input), a LAW
The data cache above keeps FETCHED data warm; this keeps UNSAVED FORM INPUT from
being lost. A half-filled create/edit form whose screen unmounts because you
navigated elsewhere in the same tab would otherwise reset to empty on return, the
input lived only in component state. **Rule: every form dialog persists its draft.**

- Back the form's values with `useFormDraft(draftKey, initialValues, open)`
  ([`shared/web/use-form-draft.ts`](../shared/web/use-form-draft.ts)) instead of plain
  `useState`. It restores a saved draft when the form opens and saves every change to
  `sessionStorage` (survives navigation AND reload within the tab; gone when the tab
  closes, "on-device per session").
- `draftKey` is a STABLE id the caller supplies: `"<module>:new:<teamId>"` for a
  create form, `"<module>:edit:<recordId>"` for an edit form. Omit it to disable.
- Lifetime: a draft is CLEARED on submit (the record now exists) and on an explicit
  dismiss (Esc / backdrop / close button); it is PRESERVED when the form simply
  unmounts from navigation, the case we protect. All drafts drop on sign-out
  (`clearAllFormDrafts`).
- Machine-enforced: every dialog in `FORM_DIALOGS` (`shared/rules/registry.ts`) must
  route its state through `useFormDraft`, checked by `web/test/rules.test.ts`.
- **And a live patch cannot reach an open form.** `useFormDraft` seeds from
  `initial` on the inactive→active edge and at no other time, so when a colleague
  saves the record you have open, the ROW moves to theirs (rule 3's `patchRow`) and
  your typing does not. That is the owner's last-save-wins ruling of 7 Sep 2026, it
  is the reason never to add `useEffect(() => setValues(initial), [initial])` to a
  dialog, and CONCURRENCY.md § *Two people editing the same record* is where it is
  written down and named.

## The agent-modules resources (BUILT 2026-06-23)

The agent + modules build adds these resources; each follows the rules above.

- **help, help_threads, brand_assets → ROW-LEVEL pings** (rule 3). Every CRUD write in
  the content worker publishes `publishChange(env, teamId, "<resource>",
  id, op)` carrying the affected row id, so open lists patch just that one row.
  (A reply both pings `help_threads` (add) and the parent `help` row (edit) so the
  ticket and its thread stay in sync.)
- **Import → ONE coarse list-ping per table.** A bulk write is the explicit
  exception to row-level: `confirm` writes every mapped row INSERT-ONLY, then
  publishes a SINGLE id-less ping on the **target table** (e.g. `member_roles` or
  `brand_assets`), one ping, not one per row, and the client refetches that one
  list (rule 6's reconcile). One list-ping per imported table.
- **agent_usage → a coarse list-ping** too: after an agent turn spends quota, the
  data-ops worker publishes an id-less `agent_usage` ping so the team's quota
  meter refreshes (no row content; just "the meter moved").
- **The agent chat / confirm endpoints are "housekeeping"** (rule 4): one person's
  private conversation, so the CONVERSATION (thread + messages) publishes NOTHING,
  the only broadcast a turn itself makes is the id-less `agent_usage` quota ping
  above. The TEAM-VISIBLE
  EFFECTS of an action the agent takes still publish normally, because the agent
  acts AS the user through the SAME gated endpoints (rule 8), the executor it calls
  is the one that fires the row-level ping. So a private turn stays private, but
  the moment it changes a real row, that row's ping fans out like any other write.

### 12 · Paged collections, the cache holds a PREFIX, not the list (R14)

A growing collection (support tickets, the team activity feed) doesn't load in one
go; its cache key holds the rows loaded **so far**, newest first, and a sidecar
`cursor:<listKey>` holds the opaque cursor for the next page (`null` = that was the
last page, `undefined` = nothing loaded yet).

- **`<LoadMore>` APPENDS** the next page to the cache, it never refetches what's
  already on screen. That is the whole difference between paging and a bigger cap.
- **Row-level live-sync is unchanged**: a ping patches the changed row inside the
  loaded prefix, exactly as before. Nothing about paging weakens rule 3.
- **A reconnect catch-up re-pulls page ONE** (`fetchList`), which is what a
  reconnect should do, you come back to the freshest rows, and can page again.
- **Tabs over a paged list must be SERVER scopes**, each with its own cache key
  (`help:<teamId>` / `help-mine:<teamId>`). Filtering a loaded page client-side
  would show "my tickets among the newest 50" beneath a badge counting all of
  them, the count is exact (R16), so the list must be too.
- **The cursor is opaque.** It travels cache → door → cache and is never built,
  parsed, or stored anywhere else. A malformed one is a clean 400, so a stale
  link fails loudly instead of quietly re-serving page one forever.
- **The PREFIX has a ceiling of its own: `CLIENT_PAGE_ROWS_CAP` (1,000).** R14 caps
  what one request returns; nothing capped what a session ACCUMULATED, and appending
  is the whole point of `<LoadMore>`, so a scrolled feed grew in memory and in the
  DOM for as long as the tab lived. At the ceiling the button is replaced by a
  sentence ("that's the first 1,000. Search or filter"), because a disabled
  Load-more reads as a bug and there IS more; this is the wrong tool for reaching
  it. Both front ends carry the number (`web/lib/live-resources.ts`,
  `web-portal/lib/tickets.ts`, the two share no lib). It sits inside
  `MAX_CACHED_ROWS` on purpose, so one list can never spend the whole tab's budget.

### 13 · A record's tab badges are EAGER, its tab rows are LAZY

A record detail's collection tabs badge a `total:<prefix>:<recordId>` sidecar
through `useCachedValue`, which is a pure cache **read** and never fetches. For a
long time the only thing that ever wrote those sidecars was the tab PANEL's own
list fetch, so the number arrived when you opened the tab and not one moment
sooner. And `formatCount` renders nothing for a zero **and** nothing for a
missing number, so "nobody has looked yet" and "there are none of these" were the
same pixels: every unopened tab read as an empty one. The owner reported it as
"until I don't click on the tab, I am always assuming that there is no
information in that tab".

So the counts are fetched when the RECORD opens and the rows are still fetched
when the TAB opens.

- **One registry, three surfaces.** `shared/record-counts.ts` says which
  collections hang off which record, which module's read right each one costs
  (R18) and which live resource moves it (R15). The doors, the screen and the
  listener all derive from it, because three hand-written copies of one list is
  how two of them come to disagree (R8: a badge's collection is derived).
- **`useRecordCounts(table, id)`** at the top of a record detail asks whichever
  doors that record needs (`GET /api/{tenancy,content}/record-counts`), in
  parallel, and primes **the same sidecars the badges already read**. Nothing on
  the screen awaits it: the record is what a person came for, so the badges
  arrive beside the content rather than in front of it.
- **Three states, kept apart in the data even though two of them render the
  same.** A NUMBER is counted (`0` means there are none, and we know). `null`
  means the caller's role holds no read right on that module, so nobody counted.
  ABSENT from the cache means not counted yet, which is the only one that ever
  resolves into something else.
- **It is two doors, not one**, because the counting functions live in the worker
  that owns each module and a domain worker binds only AUTH and REALTIME. The
  browser asks both at once; neither writes a second expression for a number the
  other already owns (R16).
- **A count that never refreshes is worse than a blank one**, because a blank
  badge looks unloaded and a stale one looks right. The counts live under
  `counts:record:<table>:<id>`, and every resource a record badges names those
  keys in its `deps` (`recordCountDeps` in `web/lib/live-resources.ts`). A ping
  carries the CHILD's id, never the parent's, so the open records are found by
  looking at the cache.

## Checklist for a new screen / module
1. Read with `useCached("<resource>:<scopeId>", fetcher)`.
2. On every server write, `publishChange(env, teamId, "<resource>", id, op)`
   **with the affected row id** (classify the route `mutation` so the seam test passes).
3. Add ONE `TEAM_RESOURCES` entry (key / idField / fetchOne / fetchList / deps), the
   generic handler does row-level patch + reconnect catch-up; no bespoke code.
4. After a client mutation, `primeCache` the fresh result.
5. Never cache cross-tenant; never trust the ping for data. Always re-pull through the gated endpoint.
6. If the collection GROWS with ordinary use, page it (rule 12): register it in
   `GROWING_COLLECTIONS`, prime the `cursor:` sidecar in its fetcher, and render
   `<LoadMore>`.
7. If it hangs off a RECORD and badges a tab there, add it to `RECORD_CHILDREN`
   (rule 13) and give its worker's door a counter, so the badge is there before
   anybody clicks the tab.

## Loading & feedback (the rule for "something's happening")

The user should never face a dead or silent UI. The locked sequence for every
screen and action:

1. **First load → skeleton.** Show a `Skeleton` shaped like the content (never a
   bare spinner for a whole screen). `useCached` returns `undefined` until the
   first fetch lands.
2. **Revisit → instant.** Cache-first means a revisit paints immediately and
   revalidates in the background (rules 1–9 above). No spinner on navigation.
3. **A write in flight → button spinner + disabled.** The button that triggered
   it shows a `Spinner` and disables (and the dialog blocks close) so it can't be
   double-fired. This also covers the rare case where a write serializes behind a
   Durable Object (see [CONCURRENCY.md](CONCURRENCY.md)), the wait is visible,
   not mysterious.
4. **Optimistic for the actor.** After a successful write, `primeCache` the fresh
   result so the person who acted sees it with zero refetch; everyone else gets
   the live ping (rule 3).
5. **Always resolve.** Finish with a `toast`, success or a plain-English error
   (the technical detail goes to the logs, see [ERROR-HANDLING.md](ERROR-HANDLING.md)).

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the live layer (the realtime worker +
the Durable Object model) that powers rule 3.

## Navigation never reloads (single-shell SPA)

In-app navigation must **swap the screen, never reload the document**. A full page
reload re-runs the session check, refetches every screen, AND wipes the in-memory
cache (rule 9), defeating cache-first entirely and multiplying server calls (this
enforces "no spinner on navigation" from Loading rule 2 above).

The **whole post-auth app** is ONE static shell (`deep-link-screen.tsx` resolves
`/home`, `/settings`, `/invitations`, every clean top-level page in
`TOP_LEVEL_MODULES` (`/tickets`, `/accounts`, `/brand`, …), and the `/t/**` tree
from the URL). Move between any of them with the **History API**
(`window.history.pushState` / `replaceState`). Next observes it, the route
segment never changes, nothing reloads, the cache stays warm, then re-render from
URL state. Deep components use the `softNavigate` bus (`web/lib/nav.ts`), which
routes to the shell's `go()`. NEVER use the framework router (`router.push`) for an
in-app hop: in a static export it has no data file for an arbitrary deep path and
falls back to a full-page reload. The router is only for the **pre-auth** routes
(`/login`, `/onboarding`), entering / leaving the app. (One-shell re-architecture
2026-07-10; the original /t-only shell landed 2026-06-21.)
