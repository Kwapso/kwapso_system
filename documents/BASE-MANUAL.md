# The Kwapso System Base, how it works, and why

This is the narrative that ties the whole base together. Every other doc is a
close-up: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) is the locked decisions,
[DATA-MODEL.md](DATA-MODEL.md) is every table, [CACHING.md](CACHING.md) is the
live layer, [RULES.md](../RULES.md) is the law-book. **This** is the map that shows
how those pieces fit and why they were cut the way they were, enough for a new
developer (or an AI agent with no prior context) to rebuild the base from zero
and extend it without breaking its invariants.

Read the two prime directives in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) first. Everything below
is downstream of them: **stay lean**, and **obey the Laws of the Base**.

---

## 1 · The shape

The Kwapso System is eight Cloudflare Workers, a two-tier database, and two static web apps the
workers serve, the agency screens and the client portal. Nothing more. The count does
not grow with the number of teams or users, it grows only when you add a genuinely new
capability, which is exactly what the eighth (the portal's own front door) was.

### The eight workers, and why each exists

A worker here is one small, single-purpose service, "small enough for an AI
agent to hold fully in its head" (ARCHITECTURE.md §2). The split is by
**domain**, not by convenience, and the seams between them are all
service-binding calls (never a public hop).

| Worker | Cloudflare name | Owns | Why it's its own worker |
|---|---|---|---|
| **auth** | `kwapso-auth` | Sign-in, a 6-digit email code via Resend or Google (no Clerk), sessions, the email-change flow, profile, `/api/auth/me`, and `/internal/send-email` | Identity is the one thing every other worker trusts. It's the single session authority: everyone else asks it "who is this?" (`whoAmI`) rather than parsing cookies themselves. |
| **tenancy** | `kwapso-tenancy` | Teams, members, Member roles (`member_roles`) + the permission sheet, invites, per-team dropdown values, the screen-recipe config store, the team-DB migration/sharding admin endpoints, **and the three subsystems that hang off the same spine:** the **customer spine** (accounts, contact links, portal logins + the one account-fence corridor), **process maps** (App → Process → Step and the savings cut from them), and **the money** (the three rate cards + margin — `account_rates`, what a client is charged; `internal_rates`, what our own hour costs; `internal_role_rates`, the per-role cost card — split across two files because R24 forbids the internal two reaching the portal) | This is the multi-tenancy engine, it owns the global "who's in which team, in which role" catalog and the per-team database lifecycle. The permission seam that every module gates against lives here, and so does the *second* fence the product needs: which **accounts** a caller may see. Both are decisions about who may read what, so they belong to one worker. |
| **realtime** | `kwapso-realtime` | The live switchboard, two Durable Object classes: `TeamChannel` (a team's channel is `REALTIME_SHARDS` shard instances — nine today, derived — `team:<id>#0` … `team:<id>#8`; a person's is one, `user:<id>`) fanning out row-level `{resource,id,op}` change pings over WebSockets, and `TeamInterest`, the per-team registry that narrows which shards each ping reaches (DURABLE-OBJECTS.md §1–2) | Live-sync is a cross-cutting concern with a stateful runtime (open sockets). It holds **no app data**, the databases stay the source of truth, so it can be a thin, hibernatable coordinator instead of a second copy of everything. |
| **content** | `kwapso-content` | **Tickets** (tickets + threaded replies, one module, no help section; the key, tables and path stay `help`, DATA-MODEL.md says why), **the work engine** (stories, sprints, work logs, to-dos, tasks, triage duty, meetings), **the knowledge base** (sources → chunks → terms → the Vectorize index, plus the 15-minute sweep and the 07:00 digest), **the per-person Google connections**, and **the agency's own housekeeping** (brand assets, meeting purposes, staff profiles) | Everything a team AUTHORS lives here. They're grouped because they share one shape, team-DB CRUD gated on a permission module, deactivate-not-delete, an audit block, R2 media, and none is big enough to deserve its own worker. It is the only domain worker besides tenancy with a cron, and both of its crons record failures to the error store (R12). |
| **data-ops** | `kwapso-data-ops` | **CSV import** (the 3-stage single-target session + the agentic multi-file batch import, AGENTIC-IMPORT.md) and **the AI agent** | Both are "operations over the other modules' data" rather than modules of their own. Import writes act-as-user through a target's create endpoint; the agent acts-as-user through every gated endpoint. Neither owns a table of user content, they orchestrate. |
| **mcp** | `kwapso-mcp` | The external machine surface: personal access tokens → a team-pinned session bridge → an opt-in tool catalogue for outside machines | It proves the point of the door design: it slots onto the same gated endpoints the agent already uses, so it added zero new trust surface beyond the token itself. How an outside tool connects + the cost model: **MCP.md**. |
| **gateway** | `kwapso` / `kwapso-staging` | The AGENCY public door: serves `web/out`, serves uploaded media from R2, and routes `/api/*` to the right worker by PREFIX | One of the two workers with a public URL. |
| **portal-gateway** | `kwapso-portal` / `kwapso-portal-staging` | The CLIENT PORTAL's public door: serves `web-portal/out`, serves media, and forwards a NAMED, CLOSED allow-list of `/api` doors | The other public one, and deliberately a different shape. A client-facing origin that fanned out by prefix would publish every tenancy route, data-ops and `/mcp` to the client internet, each defended only by a role check. It also binds only auth/tenancy/content/realtime, so data-ops and mcp are unreachable from it by construction. |

**Why only these two are public.** Everything else sets `workers_dev: false` AND
`preview_urls: false` (both, a per-version preview URL would be another public door)
and is reachable *only* via service bindings. That is what makes `/internal/send-email`
and the agent's act-as-user surface safe: **no public route can reach `/internal/*`, the
agent, or the act-as-user surface.**

**Why a door per front end, and not one shared one.** UI and agents call the *same*
endpoints, so each front end wants one origin of its own: login cookies work everywhere
on it (including an installed iOS PWA), and the internal-only surface stays internal by
physics. See `workers/gateway/src/index.ts`, which simply forwards `/api/auth/*` →
`env.AUTH`, `/api/tenancy/*` → `env.TENANCY`, `/api/content/*` → `env.CONTENT`,
`/api/data-ops/*` → `env.DATAOPS`, `/api/realtime` → `env.REALTIME`, `/media/*` from R2,
and everything else from the static assets, and `workers/portal-gateway/src/index.ts`,
which does the same job against a named allow-list instead of a prefix. Two doors, one
building: the portal and the agency app are permission-gated views of the same rows,
never copies and never synced.

### The two-tier database, and why it's split

There are two kinds of database, and the split is deliberate.

> A **user** and a **member** are not the same thing, and the split below is the
> reason: a user is an identity in the global core, a member is that identity on
> one team. [DATA-MODEL.md § `users`](DATA-MODEL.md) states the three-way
> distinction (user, member, person) once; it is not repeated here.

**One global core DB (`kwapso-core`), reached natively via `env.DB`.** It holds
everything that is about *identity and billing across teams*:

| Table | Holds | Migration |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | email, name, photo, `current_team_id` | `db/core/0001` |
| `teams` | name, logo, `database_id`, `db_status`, `schema_version` | `db/core/0002` |
| `team_members` | the card catalog: user → team → `role_id` | `db/core/0002` |
| `email_change_logs` + `email_change_codes` | the email-change security record + hashed OTP | `db/core/0005` |
| `account_activity` | a person's own identity history | `db/core/0007` |
| `importable_databases` | the owner-maintained import target catalogue | `db/core/0008` |
| `agent_usage` | per-team free daily AI counter | `db/core/0009` |
| `agent_credits` | per-team purchasable AI balance | `db/core/0010` |
| `agent_usage_log` | per-command usage trail (when · who · credits · why; confirm folds in) | `db/core/0011` |

**One isolated D1 database per team, reached over the D1 REST door.** Each team
gets its *own* database holding all of that team's content: `member_roles` +
`role_permissions`, `selectable_data`, `help` +
`help_threads`, `invite_logs`, `activity`, `data_import_sessions`,
`agent_threads` + `agent_messages`. The master definition of what lives in a team
DB, and the seed rows a newborn team starts with, is
`workers/tenancy/src/team-schema/migrations.ts` (`TEAM_MIGRATIONS`; `team-schema.ts` is the barrel that re-exports it).

**Why this split.** Two invariants pull in opposite directions:

- **Hard tenant isolation.** Another team's rows are never in the same database,
  isolation "by physics, not by query discipline" (ARCHITECTURE.md §1). A missing
  `WHERE team_id = ?` can't leak across tenants because the other tenant's rows
  aren't reachable from that connection at all. It also means a team's data can be
  moved, exported, or shard-split without touching anyone else.
- **Central identity and billing.** "Which teams am I in?", "am I still a
  member?", "does this team have AI credits left?" must be answerable *before* you
  open any team database, and must be answerable in one place for billing. So
  users, memberships, invites (the routing copy), and the AI quota live in the one
  global core.

The two tiers are reached through two different doors, and the code makes this
explicit. The core DB is the native binding `env.DB` (fast, `.prepare().bind()`).
Team DBs are reached over the Cloudflare **D1 REST API** using `CF_D1_TOKEN`,
through one data-access layer: `shared/workers/d1-rest.ts` (`d1Query`,
`d1ExecScript`, `sqlString`, plus `d1QueryAcross` for the shard read-path). Every
worker reads and writes team data through that one layer. Never ad-hoc.

### The web app

`web/` is a Next.js app exported to **static** assets, served by the gateway
alongside `/api/*` on the same origin. It is "lego assembled from a library": all
UI primitives and collections come from `shared/ui/`, imported as
`@shared/ui/components/button/button` — since the kit's v1.1.0 layout move, which
this app adopted on 2026-08-27, controls and assemblies are ONE `components/`
folder, `tokens/`, `icons/` and `motion/` sit under `foundations/`, and
whole-screen templates stay in `compositions/`; `web/` only composes *recipes*
from them. The library was the npm package `@kwapso/ui`, installed from a
separate repo, until it was **vendored into this repo on 2026-08-22**, because
the re-theme needs to change what a component IS and not only what colour it is —
and since **2026-08-25 the vendored copy is PINNED**: `github.com/Kwapso/kwapso-ui-ux`
at the tag in `shared/ui/VERSION.json`, with a hand-edit under `shared/ui/`
turning the build red (`web/test/vendored-kit.test.ts`).
**The two layers did not merge, only the address changed:** a primitive is
generic, app-agnostic lego, and a control that only makes sense in this product
still belongs in `web/components/`. If a primitive needs changing, change it
upstream in `Kwapso/kwapso-ui-ux`, tag it, and pull it with `scripts/sync-design.mjs`
(UI-GAPS.md is the list of what the kit still cannot do); `shared/ui/README.md`
says why in full. Screens are one client-resolved shell
(`web/components/deep-link/deep-link-screen.tsx`) rendering recipes from `web/lib/screens.ts`
at `/t/<teamId>/<module>/<id>` URLs.

---

## 2 · The spine, permissions

Everything in the Kwapso System routes through one gate. This is the single most important
thing to understand, because it is what makes the AI agent safe, what makes deep
links safe, and what a new module plugs into on day one.

### teamContext → requireRight

The shared gating seam is `shared/workers/gating.ts`, and every team-scoped
handler opens the same two lines: `teamContext` resolves *who is calling, which
team they are standing in, and which database that is*, then `requireRight` asks
whether their role holds the one right this door needs. Both throw a `GuardError`
that the central catch maps to a clean status.

**The step-by-step, what `teamContext` checks and in what order, the shape of
the `guard` it returns, and the exact codes each failure produces, is in
[CONVENTIONS.md §4](CONVENTIONS.md), beside the handler shape it opens.** That is
where you are standing when you need it, and one mechanism described in two
documents is a mechanism the two can disagree about. This section is the half
CONVENTIONS does not carry: *why the spine is shaped this way at all.*

**Why a tall sheet.** Permissions are `role | module | read/create/edit/delete`
rows, not columns. A new module is *new rows*, never a schema change
(DATA-MODEL.md. Glide's 24-boolean WIDE table became this TALL one). Members
point at one role; editing a role applies instantly to every holder.

**The module list lives in `shared/team-modules.ts`** (`TEAM_MODULES`), which
`workers/tenancy/src/team-schema.ts` re-exports, it moved to `shared/` the moment
data-ops needed the same list to build the import/export matrix, and the comment at
the top of that file says so: *"adding a module here is the ONLY way it appears in
either."* Read it there; any list written down elsewhere (including the next
sentence) is a copy. It began as the six Glide modules plus `screens` and `agent`,
and has grown with the product, today it also carries the customer spine
(`accounts`, `portal_users`), the knowledge base (`knowledge`), the work engine
(`processes`, `commercials`, `work`, `todos`, `meetings`), the agency's own
housekeeping (`brand_assets`, `delivery`, `staff_profiles`) and the
two Google switches (`google`, `google_mail`). Every team is born
with an **Admin** (locked, full rights) and a **Viewer** (read-only) role.

### The locked security rules the gate enforces

- **Every server request validates active-team membership + role rights.** A deep
  link to a team you're not in doesn't switch your active team, the server
  refuses; you get a no-access screen, never a partial switch. Security is never
  just hiding UI.
- **Block at every step.** UI overlays are permission-gated on open *and* every
  action re-checks `requireRight` on the server. The client guard is a courtesy;
  the server guard is the guarantee.
- **Export needs READ; import needs CREATE.** Import has no permission of its own,
  it's gated on the *target's* `create` right.
- **Deactivate, never delete.** Master records are retired (`deactivated_at` set),
  never hard-deleted, so history and access survive.

### The AI agent acts AS the signed-in user

**One shell, and the co-pilot rides above it.** The whole post-auth app is ONE client-resolved shell (`web/components/deep-link/deep-link-screen.tsx`, it resolves `/home`, `/settings`, `/invitations`, `/tickets`, and the `/t/**` tree from the URL), so all in-app navigation is soft History-API (`softNavigate` / `go()`), no reload anywhere (EDGE-CASES §1). The assistant panel is mounted ONCE at the root layout (`web/components/assistant/agent-host.tsx`) above that shell, so navigating, including the agent's own screen-trace, moves the page *underneath* it and never closes it. The launcher is gated by `agent:create`, on a reactive session cache so it appears the instant you sign in.

**Screen tracing.** While the agent works, its steps DRIVE the real screen to where the change is now VISIBLE, the affected record's detail, or the collection list where row-level live-sync makes the new/changed row appear, then rings it. Because the app is one shell, the engine soft-drives the screen from **anywhere** (Home included) with the History API, no reload. A trace **never opens an input form** (`?panel=add|edit`): the agent writes directly through the gated API, so re-opening the manual form would just leave a blank, stale dialog sitting open after the record already exists (the "created the role but left an empty new-role form open" bug). `TraceTarget` has no query field at all, so that class of bug can't be expressed. The tool→screen map is pure (`web/lib/agent-trace.ts`) and machine-checked: `trace-parity.test.ts` fails the build if a write tool ships without a result screen, or if a trace tries to carry a dialog query.

This is the payoff of the spine, and the reason there is **no separate agent
role**. The agent (`workers/data-ops/src/lib/`) does not have its own powers. Its
tool catalogue (`tools.ts`) is an **opt-in** list where every tool maps to a
gated endpoint the UI already uses. The ~two dozen CRUD tools it shares with the
external MCP surface are **declared once** in `shared/workers/tool-catalog.ts`
(`SHARED_TOOLS`) and projected into each catalogue (`toAgentTool` / `toMcpTool`),
so the two can't drift; each surface adds only its own tools on top. The executor
runs each tool AS the caller by **forwarding their session cookie**:

```ts
// workers/data-ops/src/lib/tools.ts — executeTool
const res = await fetcher.fetch(`https://internal${tool.path}${query}`, {
  method: tool.method,
  headers: { Cookie: request.headers.get("Cookie") ?? "" },  // the caller's own session
  ...
})
```

So the real door, the same `teamContext → requireRight`, re-checks the caller's
permission and validates the input on **every** agent call. The agent can never
exceed what the invoker could do by hand, because it *is* the invoker as far as
the endpoint can tell. The system prompt says it plainly ("You always act AS the
signed-in user, capped by their permissions; the system enforces this on every
call"), but the safety is structural, not a prompt promise.

Four more structural guards layer on top (all in `agent.ts` / `tools.ts`):

- **Confirm rule (destructive-only)**, a write pauses for a yes/no panel ONLY
  when it's **destructive**: the two removals (remove a member, revoke an invite)
  and the three **deactivations** (a role / article / dropdown value, *only* when
  switching OFF, an input-aware predicate), plus the high-blast **bulk / import**
  tools (whose summary carries the row COUNT). Every **constructive** write,
  create, edit, invite, grant a role, set permissions, (re)activate, a single
  status change, runs straight away (the server still gates each call by the
  caller's rights, and every write is reversible + audited). `requiresConfirm`
  (`tools.ts`) is the single place this is decided. The proposal is stored
  server-side, so `/confirm` runs exactly what the model proposed, a client can't
  approve a call it was never shown. (This deliberately relaxes the earlier
  privilege-write confirm for a smoother agent; the fence + act-as-user gating
  remain the primary defense against a prompt-injected write. Owner call,
  2026-07-10.)
- **Catastrophic blocks**, controlling device sessions and deleting the team are
  simply *not in the catalogue*; `identityBlocked` is the belt-and-braces backstop
  in `executeTool`.
- **Fenced tool results**, a tool's output goes back to the model as DATA
  (`role:"tool"`), never as instructions. **On both providers, and they fence
  differently.** Claude carries it in a real `tool_result` block, so the transport
  itself says what the text is. Workers AI (the only engine since 29 Aug 2026, when the
  Anthropic transport was deleted) rejects a replayed
  tool round-trip, so results are flattened into ordinary turns, and a flattened
  result used to arrive as a bare user message, indistinguishable from something
  the signed-in person typed. It is now wrapped in `<tool_result from="…"> … </>`,
  the system prompt names the same constant (`TOOL_RESULT_TAG`, so the promise and
  the wrapper cannot be renamed apart), and a closing marker written INTO the data
  is de-fanged, a fence the attacker can close is a decoration.
- **A step cap** (`MAX_STEPS`) and a **credit quota** (the app's own daily allowance via
  `agent_usage`. `AGENT_FREE_DAILY`, code default 25/day, but both environments
  ship 50, + a purchasable balance in `agent_credits`) bound runaways and
  abuse. Every turn is saved to `agent_threads`/`agent_messages`, the audit
  trail, and each user COMMAND writes one `agent_usage_log` row (when · who ·
  credits · why) that powers the usage view behind the panel's quota badge. A
  command that pauses for a confirm folds the confirm turn's units back into that
  one row (`foldUsageIntoLatest`), so the history reconciles with the balance.

## 3 · How a module and the base influence each other

Adding a module and changing the base are the two directions of the same
relationship. A module *plugs into* a handful of foundational seams; changing a
foundational seam *ripples* to every module. Understanding both is what lets you
extend the base safely.

### What a new module plugs into (module → base)

To add, say, a `products` module, you touch these seams and nothing else:

1. **Permissions.** Add `"products"` to `TEAM_MODULES` (`shared/team-modules.ts`),
   give it a `MODULE_LABELS` entry in the same file (the compiler forces you to.
   `MODULE_LABELS` is `Record<TEAM_MODULES,…>`),
   and a team-DB migration for its table(s). Every role's matrix now has a
   `products` row; `requireRight(cfg, guard, "products", "create")` just works.
2. **Live-sync.** Every mutation route calls `publishChange(env.REALTIME,
   guard.teamId, "products", id, op)` after the write. Screens patch just that
   row. This is a **Law** (R1). See §4.
3. **Activity.** Call the one generic writer `logActivity(cfg, databaseId, actor,
   {type, description, relatedTable: "products", relatedRowId: id})`
   (`shared/workers/activity.ts`). It writes a row into that team's `activity`
   table with a generic `(related_table, related_row_id)` pair, and the SAME read
   path (`workers/tenancy/src/lib/activity-read.ts`, `scope=record&table=&id=`)
   surfaces your module's history with **zero new read SQL** (Law R5).
4. **The screen engine.** Describe the list + detail as a recipe in
   `web/lib/screens.ts`, map its URL segment to its permission module in
   `MODULE_PERMISSION`, and the deep-link shell renders it at
   `/t/<teamId>/products/<id>`. The record detail gets **Overview + Activity tabs**
   from the library for free (Law R2).
5. **The glossary.** Any new product term goes in `shared/glossary.ts`, one clear,
   brief definition, and UI copy uses that exact word (Law R6). The agent's system
   prompt injects the whole glossary, so the assistant speaks the same dictionary.
6. **Input validation.** Parse the request body through
   `shared/workers/validate.ts` (`requireText` / `optionalText`) so bad input is a
   clean 400, never a 500.
7. **The agent (optional).** Add read/write tools to the catalogue in `tools.ts`,
   each pointing at your new gated endpoints. Because the executor forwards the
   cookie, the agent automatically inherits your module's exact permission checks,
   you write no new authz for it.

Notice what you *don't* touch: no new worker, no new database, no new auth, no new
live layer. That's the base working.

### What ripples when you change a foundational seam (base → module)

The same seams, seen from the other side. Changing one is powerful *and* loud,
the machine-checked Laws (§4) turn a careless change red before it ships.

| Change this seam | …and it ripples to | What `npm run check` catches |
|---|---|---|
| `shared/workers/gating.ts` (how gating works) | Every handler in tenancy/content/data-ops opens with `teamContext`/`requireRight` | TypeScript across all workers; a signature change won't compile |
| `shared/workers/realtime.ts` (the publish seam) | Every mutation route in three workers | `publish-seam.test.ts` reads route handlers off disk and fails if a mutation stops publishing (R1) |
| `activity-read.ts` / `activity.ts` (the one activity path) | Every module's history feed | `generic-activity-path` (R5), no per-module read SQL allowed |
| The screen engine / recipe shape | Every screen | `record-detail-tabs` (R2), `no-handrolled-toggles` (R3), `forms-use-formshell` (R4), `tab-counts-derived` (R8) |
| `shared/glossary.ts` (a term's wording) | All UI copy + the agent's system prompt | `glossary-wellformed` (R6) |
| `TEAM_MODULES` / `MODULE_LABELS` (`shared/team-modules.ts`) | The permission matrix, seeds, the Roles screen, **and** data-ops's import/export matrix, which reads the same list | `team-schema.test.ts` asserts the module list + seed row counts; `MODULE_LABELS` won't compile without a label |

### How to change foundational code safely

1. **Change the seam in one place.** There is one master copy of every rule, doc,
   and shared helper, reuse over recode. Don't fork a shared function into a
   module.
2. **Run `npm run check`**, it type-checks both front ends (`web` + `web-portal`)
   and all eight workers, then runs the full test suite across every workspace,
   including the rule + seam tests. It is the gate; keep it green.
3. **If you changed a table**, add a **migration**, never an edit-in-place. Core
   migrations live in `db/core/*`; team migrations are appended to
   `TEAM_MIGRATIONS` and rolled to every team DB by `POST
   /api/tenancy/admin/migrate-teams` (owner, `x-admin-key`).
4. **If you changed a worker**, respect the **deploy order**: realtime → auth →
   tenancy → content → data-ops → mcp → gateway → portal-gateway. Realtime is FIRST
   because every other worker service-binds it to publish change pings, and deploying
   a binder before its target fails with "Worker not found." Data-ops binds content +
   tenancy, so both must exist before it; the two gateways are last, for the same
   reason as each other, each service-binds the domain workers it forwards to.
5. **If you added a Law**, you must add it to RULES.md *and* the registry *and* a
   check together (see §4), the build fails otherwise.

---

## 4 · The safety net, the Laws of the Base

The reason a stranger can extend this base without quietly breaking its
invariants is that the invariants are **machine-checked**, not documented-and-
hoped. This is the mechanism.

A Law lives in three linked places:

- **`RULES.md`**, the human-readable law-book, one row per law.
- **`shared/rules/registry.ts`**, the same laws *as data* (`RULES_REGISTRY`),
  each carrying the `checkId` of the test that enforces it. Deny-lists (the
  reviewed exceptions) also live here as data, so every exception is a visible,
  conscious line. Never a silent bypass (e.g. `RECORD_DETAIL_EXCEPTIONS`,
  `TAB_COUNT_EXCEPTIONS`, `HOUSEKEEPING`).
- **A test that reads source straight off disk**, a per-worker
  `publish-seam.test.ts` or a case in `web/test/rules.test.ts`. Break a law and
  `npm run check` turns **red**.

**The laws today: read them in [RULES.md](../RULES.md).** They are deliberately not
re-tabulated here. This manual once carried its own copy of the table, and the copy
went stale the moment the laws grew past it, a second list of the laws is a second
thing to keep in step, which is the exact failure the registry exists to prevent. The
law-book, the registry (`shared/rules/registry.ts`) and the checks are the three linked
places; a fourth would only ever be wrong. The count has grown well past the first
handful, trust RULES.md for the current set rather than any number written elsewhere.

**Why "read off disk" matters.** The publish-seam test
(`workers/content/test/publish-seam.test.ts`) doesn't trust the ROUTES table's
labels, it pulls each handler's *source text* and checks that a `mutation`
handler actually contains a `publishChange`/`publishUserChange`/`publishSignOut`
call. You can't dodge live-sync by mislabelling a route, and you can't add a
state-changing route without consciously classifying it `read` / `mutation` /
`housekeeping`. The classification *is* the reminder.

**The registry can't drift from the doc.** A meta-check (`registry-integrity` in
`web/test/rules.test.ts`) asserts RULES.md lists *exactly* the law ids in the
registry. So: **you cannot add a Law without its check, and you cannot add a
check without its Law.** To add one, do all three steps (registry row + test +
RULES.md row) or the build fails, which is precisely the property that keeps an
agreed rule from silently slipping over time.

**That invariant is no longer a "next Law", it landed, and the id it was pencilled
in under went to something else.** This paragraph used to propose `R9 (ai): every
agent tool maps to a gated route`. R9 is now *agent/MCP capability parity* (the
system prompt's brief is GENERATED from the catalogs, so the UI and the agent can
never disagree), and the "every tool maps to a gated route" invariant §2 relies on
is machine-checked from three directions instead: **R10** (`gating-seam`, with the
mcp surface carrying its own suite), `workers/mcp/test/catalog.test.ts` (every
forwarded path checked against the target worker's own `ROUTES`), and **R19**/**R22**
(the tool exposes and forwards every filter and every body field its door accepts).
Read RULES.md for the current set; a number written here would be the fourth copy
the registry exists to prevent.

## 5 · Fork the base for a new product (ERP, portal, CRM…)

The Kwapso System is not an app, it's the **foundation** you start a new product on. When you
build, say, an ERP or a client portal, you inherit login, teams, member roles +
permissions, invites, emails, live-sync, the screen engine, the CSV import, and the
AI agent **for free**, and you add your product's own modules on top. Here's the
whole story.

**What you keep, untouched.** The eight workers, the two-tier database, the gate
(`teamContext → requireRight`), the realtime layer, the auth/email flow, the agent,
and the Laws. These are the base. You do not re-solve multi-tenancy, permissions, or
live updates, they're done.

**What you rename (once).** The product's identity, not its plumbing: the app name +
brand (in the web app's config + the `PUBLIC_APP_URL`/URLs), the worker name prefix
if you want your own (`kwapso-*` → `<yourapp>-*` in the `wrangler.jsonc` files and the
deploy scripts), and the GitHub/Cloudflare project names (the `/new-app` skill
automates the scaffold + backup + staging + production wiring). Everything the base
does keeps working because none of the *seams* changed.

**Where your product lives.** Every product-specific thing users work with is a
**module**, an ERP's `invoices`, `products`, `purchase_orders`; a portal's `tickets`,
`documents`. Each is one team-scoped table + a permission row + gated CRUD + a screen,
added exactly as **BUILD-A-MODULE.md** describes. Your ERP is "the base + N modules."
Because a module plugs into the same six seams (§3), your `invoices` module gets
live-sync, activity, the Overview/Activity detail, search/filters, and **agent
control** (the AI can act on invoices AS the user) without extra work, you just
follow the golden path.

**The order to build a new product.**
1. Stand up the base on your own account. **BOOTSTRAP.md**, end to end.
2. Rename the identity (or run `/new-app` to scaffold a fresh one on this base).
3. Add your first module. **BUILD-A-MODULE.md** (`invoices`, say). Ship it. Repeat
   per module.
4. Add agent tools for your module (an entry in `data-ops`'s tool catalog per
   endpoint) so the AI can drive it, same act-as-user, same confirm rule.
5. Keep `npm run check` green and obey the Laws; they're what stop a fast-growing
   product from drifting.

**Two fork gotchas worth naming.** (1) `TEST_LOGIN_KEY` on the **auth** worker is a
NON-PRODUCTION secret, it enables the test-login door (sign in as any account). It is
deliberately NOT called `ADMIN_KEY`: that name is the maintenance key you set on tenancy
and data-ops in BOTH environments, and sharing it would mean one mistyped
`wrangler secret put` directory armed impersonation on production. The door also refuses
outright when the worker's `ENVIRONMENT` var is `production`, so the isolation survives a
mistake rather than depending on this paragraph being read. (2) The import catalog **self-heals on read** (R13), a fresh
fork's target picker works with no seed step; `seed-targets` only refreshes labels.

**Two REASONED exceptions a fork inherits, decide on both before launch.** These
are not oversights; they are deliberate positions the base takes, which are right
for some products and wrong for others.

1. **Uploaded files are capability URLs, not gated reads.** `/media/*`,
   `/media/internal/*` and `/media/learning/*` (a read-only legacy prefix,
   nothing writes to that bucket since the Learning module was purged, and it
   stays so the images inside articles the knowledge base kept still load) serve
   any object whose key you know: every key is minted
   by one seam (`mediaKey`, `shared/workers/image.ts`) as owner ids plus a random
   ULID, the gateway validates the requested key at the boundary (`safeMediaKey`)
   and serves it with `default-src 'none'; sandbox` + `nosniff`, but it checks
   **no session and no membership**. (Until 2026-08-10 two of the three key
   shapes, team logos and profile photos, were *derivable* from a visible id,
   so "you must know the key" wasn't a barrier for them at all; that half is
   closed, the decision itself stands.) *The threat, plainly:* anyone who was
   ever given a link keeps it
  , a removed ex-member who saved the URL of a to-do's attachment can still open
   it after losing access, and so can anyone they forwarded it to. There is no
   expiry and no revocation. That is an acceptable trade for product photos and
   team logos. It is **not** acceptable for invoices, contracts, ID documents,
   payroll, health or anything a regulator would call personal data. **If your
   product stores any of that, fix this before launch:** require a session on
   `/media/*` and check membership against the key's leading team segment (or
   move to short-lived signed URLs).
2. **Two reads return identity data behind a neighbouring module's right.**
   `GET /api/content/help/stakeholders` (gated `help:read`) returns teammates'
   email addresses, and `GET /api/tenancy/team-meta` returns the creator's email
   to any member. Both are correctly
   **tenant-scoped**, no other team's data is reachable, so this is a
   wrong-right mismatch inside one team, not a leak between customers. It is left
   as-is because the alternative (splitting those responses per-right) costs more
   than it protects for a team-wide tool where colleagues know each other's names.
   Revisit it if your product gives some members deliberately restricted
   visibility of *other members*, a marketplace, a franchise network, a client
   portal where tenants share a team.

**What a new product must NOT do.** Don't hand-roll a second copy of a component that
`shared/ui/` already ships, and don't hand-edit the one in `shared/ui/` either —
`shared/ui/` is a PINNED dependency of `github.com/Kwapso/kwapso-ui-ux` (the tag is in
`shared/ui/VERSION.json`), a hand-edit turns the build red
(`web/test/vendored-kit.test.ts`), and a kit change is made upstream, tagged, and
pulled with `scripts/sync-design.mjs`. Don't add a public worker (only the two
gateways are public, a third
public address is a third door onto `/internal/*`, the agent and the act-as-user
surface), don't add
a per-module database (one D1 per *team*, not per module, modules are tables inside
it), and don't relitigate the locked decisions in ARCHITECTURE.md without a deliberate
reason. Staying inside the seams is what keeps a big product lean and secure.

## 6 · How each part scales

The base is built to grow along every axis the owner asked about. Here's the growth
path for each subsystem, what's already in place, and what you turn on when you get
bigger.

- **Teams (tenants).** Each team has its **own D1 database**, so teams are isolated by
  *physics*, not by a `WHERE team_id =` filter, one noisy tenant can't touch another,
  and a team's data can move databases without collisions (every id is a ULID). Growth
  path: today every team DB is created on demand; the D1 REST door
  (`shared/workers/d1-rest.ts`) already supports **fanning a query across shard
  databases** (`d1QueryAcross`), so a single logical team can be split across databases
  when one hits D1's size cap. A nightly cron sizes every team DB and alarms at 80% of
  the 10 GB cap (OPERATIONS.md), so you see the ceiling coming.

- **Member roles + permissions.** The permission model is a **tall sheet**
  (`role_permissions`: `role_id · module · read/create/edit/delete`). Adding a module
  or a role is **new rows, never a schema change**, so permissions scale to any number
  of modules and roles with zero migrations. Editing a role applies instantly to every
  holder (members point at a role id, not a copy of the rights). The one invariant to
  respect as you grow: a team always keeps **≥1 admin** (enforced race-safely.
  CONCURRENCY.md).

- **Invites.** An invite is a global index row (`invite_index`) + a per-team audit log.
  Accepting is **race-safe** (email-ownership + pending + unexpired, UPSERT so a
  re-joining removed member reactivates cleanly). Scales to any invite volume because
  the accept path opens no team database until it writes. Emails are sent through the
  one sender (below); the link uses `PUBLIC_APP_URL`.

- **Emails.** Every outbound email goes through **one worker** (auth's
  `/internal/send-email`, guarded by `INTERNAL_KEY`), so the provider is swappable in
  one place and rate/retry policy lives in one place. Scale by swapping Resend for a
  higher-tier provider (or adding a queue in front of that one seam), no caller
  changes.

- **Live updates.** The realtime layer fans a **tiny `{resource, id, op}` ping** (never
  row data), so a busy team costs bandwidth in bytes, not kilobytes. Each team's
  channel is **its own set of `TeamChannel` Durable Objects — `REALTIME_SHARDS` shard
  instances, `team:<id>#0` … `team:<id>#8` (nine today, derived from the peak since
  7 Sep 2026), plus one `TeamInterest` registry that narrows
  which shards each ping reaches** — every one hibernatable (idle instances cost
  ~nothing), so ten thousand teams don't cost a hundred thousand always-on processes.
  *(Fact updated 26 Aug 2026: this bullet said one `TeamChannel` per team; the
  channel was split across `REALTIME_SHARDS` on 14 Aug 2026 — a publisher still
  names `team:<id>` and the realtime worker's `/publish` door owns the fan-out.)*
  The hot-team ceiling (a single team fanning thousands of writes/sec) is a known
  axis, and where it now sits is ARCHITECTURE.md §7's arithmetic. DURABLE-
  OBJECTS.md documents the mechanism and when to reach for a different DO.

- **The AI agent.** Bounded by a **per-team credit quota** (free daily allowance +
  purchasable balance) and a **step cap**, so cost and abuse scale with a knob, not
  with hope. The brain is a **swappable model seam** (`selectModel`): move to a cheaper
  or stronger model with one var as your volume/needs change. The tool catalog is
  opt-in, so the agent's power grows only as fast as you add tools.

- **The data layer's cost.** Every per-team query is an **HTTP round-trip** (the REST
  door), so the base is built to **batch** (multi-statement `d1ExecScript`) and
  **parallelise** independent reads (`Promise.all` / `d1QueryAcross`). As a screen grows
  data-heavy, those are the levers (EDGE-CASES.md). The client cache-first + row-level
  live-sync means more data does **not** mean more refetching.

- **The web app.** A **static export** served from Cloudflare's edge, it scales like a
  CDN asset (no server render per request). The whole `/t/*` tree is one shell, so
  adding screens adds recipes, not routes.

The through-line: every axis scales by a **seam or a knob that already exists**, not by
a rewrite. That's the payoff of the locked architecture.

### 6.5 · When a team database approaches the cap, the shard runbook

The nightly cron (tenancy, 03:10 UTC) measures every team database and writes a
`db_alerts` row at **80% of D1's 10 GB cap**, so you see the ceiling coming months
out, not the day writes fail. When an alarm fires, this is the path, in order:

1. **Find the weight.** One module's table is almost always the bulk (a products or
   events table, not roles). `SELECT name, SUM(pgsize) FROM dbstat GROUP BY name`
   on the team DB names it.

2. **Stage 1. Split by MODULE (the designed first move).** Every read and write in
   the app flows through ONE seam: the data door (`d1Query`/`d1ExecScript` with
   `guard.databaseId`). Nothing else touches a team database, not the UI, not the
   agent, not MCP, not the import engine (they all call the gated endpoints, which
   call the door). So moving one module's tables to a NEW D1 database for that team
   is a **routing change at that seam**: create the database, copy the module's rows
   (ULIDs are globally unique, no collisions), and teach the door a per-module
   database map (`databaseIdFor(guard, module)` instead of the single
   `guard.databaseId`). Every caller above the seam is untouched, that is why the
   base bans raw DB access everywhere else.

3. **Stage 2. Split ONE table across two databases (same-table sharding).** Only
   when a single module outgrows a whole database. Shard by time: **ULIDs sort by
   creation time**, so "shard 1 = rows before cutoff, shard 2 = after" needs no new
   key. Writes go to the newest shard (one-line routing); reads use
   `d1QueryAcross(cfg, [shard1, shard2], sql)`, already in
   `shared/workers/d1-rest.ts`, which queries the shards IN PARALLEL and merges.
   Performance: a fanned read costs the LATENCY OF THE SLOWEST SHARD (they run
   concurrently), not the sum; sorting/paging happens on the merged rows, so keep
   per-shard LIMITs generous and page in the worker.

4. **Who has to know?** Nobody above the door. The developer API, the MCP tools and
   the agent all call the same gated endpoints; the endpoints call the door; the
   door owns routing. A human/agent doing the split follows THIS section; a
   consumer of the app never sees it.

**What's built today vs what's a documented path:** the alarm cron, `db_alerts`,
`db_growth`, `d1QueryAcross`, ULID time-ordering and the single-door discipline are
BUILT, tested and running. Stage 1 — the mover — is built and **switched off at its
door** (`SPLIT_READS_WIRED`, `workers/tenancy/src/lib/sharding.ts`).

This paragraph used to end "`databaseIdsFor(teamId, module)` then answers
override-first + main so merged reads see both homes", and that sentence was the
gap. Nothing in the app asks that question: `requireMember` resolves one
`guard.databaseId` out of `teams.database_id`, every module lib reads it, and
`resolveModuleDatabases`/`queryModule` have no callers outside the sharding lib. So
the mover would copy a module's tables to a fresh database, verify the counts, flip
the routing row, empty the old home — and every ticket screen, count, export, agent
answer and MCP tool for that module would then read the database it had just
emptied, on both front doors, while the door answered `status: "done"` and resolved
the size alarm.

Two things have to land before the valve opens, and the second is the larger:
(1) the read path has to consult `team_module_databases`, and (2) a merged read has
to be able to PAGE, SORT and COUNT — `d1QueryAcross` deliberately refuses all three
across more than one database, because a concatenation cannot answer them, and
every collection in this base does all three (R14, R16). That is a cross-shard
cursor, a merged sort and a summed count: an architecture decision, not a patch.
Until it is taken, a full team database is relieved by archiving or by moving the
TEAM, and stage 2's same-table cutover stays a documented path (Prime Directive 1).

**Organizing many apps in Cloudflare:** Cloudflare has no folders. The base's
convention is (a) a name prefix per product, every worker, database and bucket
starts `kwapso-` (a fork renames the prefix, BASE-MANUAL §5), and (b) for real
isolation, **one Cloudflare account per product** (BOOTSTRAP assumes this): separate
billing, separate limits, separate blast radius. Within one account, the prefix IS
the project grouping. Search boxes in the dash filter on it.

## The base in one breath

Eight workers behind two public doors, one per front end, and no more. A global core DB for identity + billing, one
isolated D1 per team for its content. One gate (`teamContext → requireRight`) that
every request. UI *and* agent, passes through, so the AI can do anything the
user can and nothing they can't. A module plugs into six seams (permissions,
live-sync, activity, the screen engine, the glossary, validation); changing a
seam ripples to every module, and the machine-checked Laws catch the ripple before
it ships. Add the least code that solves the problem, reuse the existing seams,
and keep `npm run check` green.
