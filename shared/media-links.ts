// A LINK TO A VIDEO IS NOT A SOURCE — it is a link to one.
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every unreadable thing that ever reached this knowledge base failed the same
// way: it was ACCEPTED, stored, and quietly never read. 131 files of logo
// artwork went into the index that way. Every PDF in the base scored 0.000 on
// letter-shaped tokens that way. `image/*` has been opaque since the beginning
// that way. In none of those cases was the person told.
//
// A video link would have been the next one. So the owner ruled on 27 Aug 2026
// that it is REFUSED instead — and that the refusal carries the fix:
//
//   > it should warn the user that whenever we are trying to import something
//   > into the knowledge base and it's some kind of video or YouTube link, it
//   > gives a hint plus a text box to paste the transcript ourselves. Otherwise,
//   > it does not accept the source.
//
// So: readable, or refused with the remedy in hand. Never a row that looks
// filed and answers nothing.
//
// ── WHAT THIS IS NOT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// IT IS NOT THE GATE, and after 27 Aug 2026 it is not even close to it. The gate
// is that a source whose only content is a LINK has nothing for the assistant to
// read, whatever the link points at — that rule closes a custom domain, a service
// nobody has heard of, and the one somebody will use next year, none of which a
// list can do. This predicate only chooses which SENTENCE the person reads.
//
// The distinction was earned. The first version made this the gate, and a Tella
// recording behind the owner's own domain walked straight past fifteen hostnames
// and became a source with a title, a link and no body — precisely the shape the
// whole ruling exists to prevent. A detector is a list that is wrong the moment
// somebody uses a service not on it. An empty body cannot be out of date.
//
// And it fetches NOTHING. There is no scrape here, on purpose: the owner ruled
// against depending on endpoints nobody promises us — not YouTube's `timedtext`,
// not Loom's `GetVideoSSR`. "No auth" is not "supported", and a silent break
// there means videos stop being readable with nobody noticing until somebody
// asks a question the video would have answered.
//
// Shared because BOTH sides need the same answer: the door refuses on it, and
// the form explains on it while somebody is still typing. Two copies of this
// list would be two answers to one question.
