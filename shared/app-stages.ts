// WHERE AN APP HAS GOT TO — the eight stages, and the one thing each of them
// decides.
//
// They are not an enum. The eight names are seeded as ordinary values in the
// `App stage` dropdown group (SELECTABLE_GROUPS.appStage), so a team adds or
// retires one on the Dropdown values screen without a deploy — the same shape as
// the departments and the sprint types. What lives HERE is the part a dropdown
// row cannot carry on its own: the ORDER the agency reads them in, and whether a
// stage means the app is still being worked on or is put away.
//
// The names, marks and order are read off the legacy data
// (`glide/data/agency.choices.json`, rows where `Name` is "APPS" and the field is
// "Stage") rather than invented. The legacy spelling of one of them is
// "Mainteinance"; it is carried across as **Maintenance**, because a typo is not
// a vocabulary and the checklist names it correctly.
//
// THE ACTIVE / INACTIVE SPLIT is one boolean per stage, and the default for a
// stage the code has never met is ACTIVE. A team that invents "Pilot" should see
// its apps beside the ones being worked on, not filed away in Inactive — the
// harm of the wrong guess is asymmetric, and an app nobody can find is worse than
// an app in the wrong group.
//
// THE DOT COLOUR (client ruling, 2026-08-31): "the second pill with status (and
// color dot)". The six tones a status pill can carry are `Badge`'s own
// (`--dot-shipped/-building/-review/-blocked/-archived/-done`,
// shared/ui/components/badge/badge.tsx) — the reused vocabulary, not an eighth
// colour invented for apps. Reading the client's own screenshot back
// ("Maintenance" in a green dot) is what fixes the mapping rather than guessing
// it: green is `--dot-shipped`/`--dot-done` (the same token, twice-named), so a
// live, healthy app in Maintenance is `done`. The rest read off the same idea —
// still being worked on is `building` (the charcoal dot, "in build"), still being
// scoped is `review`, and put away is `archived`.

/** `Badge`'s own six dot tones (`shared/ui/components/badge/badge.tsx`'s
 * `BadgeDot`), restated here rather than imported: this file is compiled by
 * both front doors AND every worker (`workers/tenancy/src/team-schema.ts`
 * reads `APP_STAGES` for seed data), and `shared/ui/` is DOM-only — a
 * worker's tsconfig excludes it outright (no `--jsx`), so even a type-only
