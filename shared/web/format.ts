// Shared display formatters — ONE source so dates look identical everywhere
// (members list, activity feed, overview tabs). No duplication of date logic.
//
// LOCALE IS EXPLICIT, NEVER AMBIENT. Every formatter below takes a required
// `lang: Language` and hands it straight to `Intl` as the locale. Passing
// `undefined` instead — the shape this file used to be — asks `Intl` to
// resolve the RUNTIME's ambient default locale, which is Node's default
// during server rendering and the browser's during client hydration. Those
// two are not guaranteed to agree ("Mar 12, 2024" vs "12 Mar 2024" for the
// same instant), and when they disagree React's hydration throws — on a plain
// date, with no network involved and nothing else wrong. Ruling 07 in the kit
// (`shared/ui/`) already says this for every date-shaped component there:
// "Dates follow the app language, not the browser" — formatting is the
// CALLER's job, done with the app's own current language. `Language` codes
// ("en", "de", "es", "ca") are themselves valid BCP-47 tags, so they pass to
// `Intl` directly with no mapping table.
//
// Required rather than optional, for the same reason `formatRelative`'s `t`
// is required (see its own comment, below): an optional `lang` defaulting to
// `undefined` is the ambient-default failure this file exists to close,
// spelled as an API. Required, TypeScript names every call site that forgot.

 * IT TAKES `t` AND THE PARAMETER IS REQUIRED. For a year this function returned
 * four English strings to nine call sites across BOTH front doors — a message
 * bubble's timestamp, an attachment's meta line, the record footer, the ticket
 * list — and none of them was in any catalogue, because this file sits in
 * `shared/web/` and the extractor was a list of six folders that did not name
 * it. So `t("Created by {name} · {when}")` translated its own half of the line
 * into German and rendered "vor" nowhere: *Erstellt von Aurora · 5d ago*.
 *
 * Required rather than optional, and that is the whole design of the parameter.
 * An optional `t` defaulting to English is the failure this is fixing, spelled
 * as an API: it compiles at every call site that forgets, and it is invisible
 * to every check here. Required, TypeScript names the nine.
 *
 * THE HOLES ARE WHERE THEY ARE FOR THE TRANSLATOR, NOT FOR US. `{count}m ago`
 * is one catalogue entry with one hole rather than a number glued to a unit
 * glued to a word: German puts the preposition in front (*vor 5 Min.*) and
 * Japanese puts the whole thing behind the number (*5分前*), and neither is
 * reachable by concatenating fragments a translator cannot reorder.
 *
 * AND IT STAYS TERSE. Seven of the nine call sites are tight — table cells with
 * `tabular-nums`, attachment meta lines, message-bubble timestamps — so the
 * words stay as short as each language can make them. This is the app's ONE
 * relative-time vocabulary; nothing else may grow a second.
 *

 * calls `formatDate`, whose own locale argument is required, so this function
