// List — the OLD library's list contract, drawn by the kit. Same seam pattern
// as shared/web/field.tsx and the engine's TabsView: seven call sites across
// the front doors write `items` / `leading` / `subtitle` / `trailing` /
// `onItemClick` / `surface`, and the kit's List (structures/list) speaks
// `rows` / `mark` / `description` / `action` / `onRowSelect` / `variant`.
// One translation here beats seven hand-reshapes that must each be right.

// The kit's own `List` ALWAYS wraps whatever sits in a row's mark slot in its
// own circular `Avatar` (list.tsx: `<Avatar size="md" variant="quiet">`) — its
// own doc comment invites "an icon or any node in the well instead of
// initials", i.e. bare content, not a second styled box. A `<RecordMark>` IS
// a second styled box (its own background, shape and `overflow-hidden`,
// shared/web/record-mark.tsx), so passing one straight through nested two
// avatars per row — the kit's own circular one, holding a full `RecordMark`
// box a second time inside it. Unwrapped here to `RecordMarkGlyph`, the same
// component with no box of its own, so the kit's Avatar is the only one.
//
// GAP, not silently papered over: the kit's `List` has no per-row shape, so
// this can only ever draw a circle — never `RecordMark`'s own square (R31: a
// client, an app, an asset). In practice today that loses nothing new: at
// every size `List` rows use (`row`, `tile`, `choice`), `RecordMark`'s own
// `rounded-[var(--radius)]` already renders as a full circle before this file
// ever sees it — this app's `--radius` token is more than half of each box's
// side, so the browser's own corner-radius-overlap rule (CSS Backgrounds §
// on radii that would overlap) rounds all four corners down to a circle
// standalone, with no kit involved (measured live, `web/app/zz-verify-list-mark`,
// since deleted: a bare `shape="square"` mark at `choice`/`row`/`tile`/`band`
// all failed a 1px corner hit-test — the square never had corners to begin
// with at these sizes). Whether `record-mark.tsx` should draw a genuinely
// square box at these sizes is a separate, bigger question — flagged, not
// decided here.
