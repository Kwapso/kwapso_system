// Render a markdown STRING as light, XSS-safe HTML — the assistant's replies, and
// any BODY that was written in markdown rather than in the Notes editor's HTML.
// The agent's output is UNTRUSTED, so we ESCAPE the raw text first (escapeText),
// THEN convert only a tiny, safe subset: inline code, links (each URL run through
// safeHref — http/https/mailto only, and the href escaped as an ATTRIBUTE so a
// crafted URL can't break out of the quotes), bold, italic, bullet + numbered
// lists, and blank-line paragraphs / soft line breaks. Pure string functions (no
// JSX) so they're unit-testable; the AgentMarkdown component just wraps toHtml.
//
// ONE GROUPING, TWO RENDERERS (2026-08-27). The grouping — which lines are a
// paragraph, which run is a list, which line is a heading — is now its own
// function (`mdBlocks`), and `toHtml` is the string renderer over it. The reason
// is the assistant's citation marks: a `<Cite>` is a REACT element that has to
// sit inside the sentence it belongs to, and a component cannot be injected into
// an HTML string, so web/components/assistant/agent-markdown.tsx renders the same blocks
// into React instead. Splitting `toHtml`'s OUTPUT at the marker was the obvious
// alternative and it tears paragraphs in half — a `<p>` opened in one fragment
// and closed in the next is two block elements to the browser, so every citation
// would break its own line. Two renderers over one grouping cannot disagree
// about what a "## " is; two markdown implementations would.
