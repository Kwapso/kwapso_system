"use client"

// A FILES AND LINKS TAB SHOWS WHAT IT HOLDS. One component, all three panels
// that draw one — a story's, a ticket's, and the client's view of the same
// ticket.
//
// THE ASK (owner, 27 Aug 2026): "everywhere that we have file uploads, can we
// just make sure that wherever we have this files and links tab, we do our best
// to preview them rather than me clicking on everything." He had a story
// carrying four screenshots and four lines of text reading
// `Screenshot 2026-08-27 at 12.56.45 PM.png`, `…at 12.59.19 PM.png`, `…at
// 2.08.43 PM.png`. Nothing on the screen said which was which, so finding one
// meant opening all four.
//
// IT IS THE KIT'S `Image`, NOT A THUMBNAIL WE DREW. The standing rule is that
// we draw nothing the kit already draws, and the kit draws exactly this: a
// media well at `--radius` on `--surface-quiet`, with the spinner and the
// failure register built in, and `lazy` already true. Every one of those is a
// decision we would otherwise have got slightly differently in three files.
//
// AND IT IS NOT THE KIT'S `Gallery`, which is the obvious wrong answer and the
// kit says so itself. `structures/gallery` quotes its own brief: "Offered only
// where images exist … It is never offered for tickets, accounts or sprints —
// an image-led view of text records is a grid of empty boxes pretending to be
// content." A Files and links tab is precisely that mixed list: screenshots
// beside a PDF beside a Loom link. A Gallery of it would draw title-on-paper
// stand-ins for most of its tiles, and its caption is "two lines, hard", which
// has no room for the size, the person, the date and the two actions the row
// already carries. So the LIST stays (UI-RULEBOOK K5: one card, hairline rows)
// and the picture goes under the name, where it costs the row nothing when
// there is no picture to show.
//
// WHICH FILES GET ONE is `isRenderableImage`, which lives one line under
// `storedContentType` because they have to be the same sentence: an SVG is
// `image/svg+xml`, is not inline-safe, and is stored as octet-stream, so an
// `<img>` at one draws the browser's torn-paper glyph. Everything else — a PDF,
// a spreadsheet, a link — keeps the glyph its row already had. "Do our best"
// is honest about its limit: a first-page render of a PDF is a real piece of
// work and this is not it.
//
// CONTAINED, NOT COVERED — AND IT IS NOW THE APP'S ONLY ONE (R60). `fit="contain"`
// letterboxes the whole picture onto the quiet ground rather than trimming it to
// the box — the ruling the kit's own gallery chapter makes ("the brand shows the
// whole artefact"; "cover would cut a face out of the frame"). For telling two
// screenshots apart it is the difference between the answer and a crop of the
// answer.
//
// THE CLIENT RULED THE OTHER WAY ON 2026-09-09 — *"everywhere for images: do
// fill, not fit!"* — and this file is the ONE site kept back from it, as the
// single `OBJECT_FIT_OK` line in `web/test/an-image-fills.test.ts`, which is
// where the argument is written out in full. In short: every other picture that
// law governs is a MARK standing FOR a record whose name is written beside it,
// so a crop costs the edges of an identity the word already carries. This one IS
// the content, with no word beside it saying what was lost — a portrait
// screenshot cropped to the well's 16/9 shows a band from its middle and hides
// the error message at the top, which is the reason somebody attached it, and
// nothing on screen says so because a crop looks exactly like a picture that was
// always that shape.
//
// IT IS FLAGGED FOR HER, NOT DECIDED AGAINST HER. Her ruling was made over marks
// in select components and filters, and this is the one place in the app it does
// not obviously describe. If she says it does, the fix is two edits: `cover`
// here, and delete the exemption line — which the law's own rot-check will
// demand in the same breath.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS, said out loud. These are the ORIGINAL bytes: a ticket may
// carry fifty attachments (TICKET_ATTACHMENT_CAP) of up to 10MB each, and
// nothing in this product makes a thumbnail. So the fetch is bounded the two
// ways available without a server-side resize: the kit's `lazy` (native
// `loading="lazy"`, so a preview below the fold is not fetched until it is
// nearly on screen) and a capped display width, which keeps the tab scannable
// as well as cheap. A real thumbnail pipeline is the follow-up, and until it
// exists this is the honest ceiling.
