// What is deliberately NOT here: the door lists. `web/lib/api/` and

// call, because those inventories mean something — the portal's is checked
// against the portal gateway's allow-list, and the agency's is the attack
// surface the closed-door suite fires at the portal. Merging them would erase
// both facts. What was genuinely the same is the plumbing underneath, which used
// to exist twice, byte for byte, owned by nobody.

 * It exists because the client half of a list read used to spell its door's
 * parameters out one `if` at a time, and a parameter spelled out is a parameter
 * somebody can leave out. That is not hypothetical: `content.knowledge` took the
 * find's whole question and copied three fields of it across, so when sorting
 * arrived and put `sort` in that question, the knowledge base's sort control
 * changed the cache key, refetched the same rows in the same order, and looked
 * like it worked. Nothing was broken by the change — the drop was already there,
 * waiting for a fourth parameter to exist.
 *
 * So nothing here knows the names. A caller hands over the object it was given
 * (`{ ...query, cursor }`) and every non-empty value in it reaches the door,
 * which is the one arrangement where forgetting is not possible. The TYPES on
 * each client method still say what its door takes — that is what documents the
 * contract; this is what carries it. */
