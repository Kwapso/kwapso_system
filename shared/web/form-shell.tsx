"use client"

// FormShell — the ONE layout every form/dialog uses, so create / edit screens are
// predictable and identical across modules (the owner's design-language law):
//
//   title + subtitle   ·   the fields, SCROLLING   ·   the action bar, PINNED
//
// A host-side recipe assembled from library primitives — NOT a new library
// component. Pass the title as a <DialogTitle> and subtitle as a <DialogDescription>
// (so Radix Dialog a11y stays intact) and the action button(s) as `footer`.
//
// ── WHY IT IS A THREE-ROW GRID (UI-RULEBOOK F2 / F3) ───────────────────────
//
// It used to be a plain `flex flex-col` with no height bound at all, and a form is
// as tall as its fields. A centred dialog centres itself with `top-1/2
// -translate-y-1/2`, so a form taller than the window grew EQUALLY off the top and
// off the bottom, and nothing scrolled: on a 1280×640 window the Edit story dialog
// measured 738px, its title clipped above the viewport and its Save button below
// it, unreachable. A tester reported it as the Save button rendering outside the
// dialog box, which is exactly what it looks like.
//
// `max-h-[85dvh]` (standalone) / `h-full` (inside `FormShellDialog`'s panel, which
// is already edge-to-edge) + `grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto]` fixes the class of bug
// rather than the instance: the header and the action bar are `auto`, the FIELDS
// are the `1fr` row and the only thing that scrolls, so the action bar is always
// on screen no matter how many fields a module adds. `dvh` rather than `vh`
// because a phone's address bar is the difference between "pinned" and "just
// under the fold".
//
// And the two separators are gone. A free-standing hairline sitting a fixed gap
// above a 42px pill is a collision waiting for the next type-scale change (it had
// already had one: see the note on `pt-6` in library-overrides.css, a documented
// fix that never actually shipped). A `border-t` on a PADDED bar cannot collide
// with the button inside it, at any size, because the hairline is the bar's own
// edge. This removes both front doors' last use of `primitives/separator`, which
// is right: a separator divides peers, and a form's action bar is not a peer of
// its fields.
//
// ── CENTRED DIALOG → SIDE PANEL, 2026-08-31 ─────────────────────────────────
//
// `FormShellDialog` used to render on `Dialog`/`DialogContent` (centred, self-
// sizing). COMPOSITION-MISMATCHES.md reviewed swapping it for the kit's side-panel
// `templates/form-screen.tsx` and kept the dialog on purpose: that composition's
// real advantage over this shell isn't its position, it's a field-name-aware
// required-fields summary and a changed-fields dirty band, and none of this
// shell's 37 real callers track fields by name today — "a real, scoped feature to
// build, not a chrome swap behind one flag." The owner reviewed that reasoning and
// asked to proceed anyway. So this is a DELIBERATE, informed override of that
// call, not a reversal of it: `FormShellDialog` now renders on the app's own
// already-adopted `Sheet`/`SheetContent` (18 other call sites, side="right", the
// same `@radix-ui/react-dialog` primitive underneath, so every existing
// `<DialogTitle>`/`<DialogDescription>` call site keeps its a11y wiring for
// free) instead of `Dialog`/`DialogContent`. NOTHING ELSE FROM THAT REVIEW WAS
// BUILT: there is still no required-fields-by-name summary and no changed-fields
// dirty band anywhere in this shell. Only the chrome moved from the middle of the
// screen to its side; the feature gap COMPOSITION-MISMATCHES.md named is exactly
// as open after this change as it was before it.
//
// ── THE FOCUS RING'S OUTER EDGE, AND THE PANEL'S OWN WIDTH, 2026-08-31 ──────
//
// Client-reported, on the just-shipped sheet: a heavy, flush black edge on the
// TITLE field's near (start) side only when it is focused — not the ring
// `input.tsx` draws everywhere else (a hairline gap, then a thin outline,
// even on all four sides). Reproduced by mounting a real, unmodified caller
// (`InternalRecordDialog`) and reading the live box back with
// `getComputedStyle`/`getAnimations()`: the OUTLINE ITSELF was never wrong —
// one `outline: 1px solid` at a 2px offset, exactly tokens.css §8, on every
// side, at rest and mid-animation alike. `outline` cannot render unevenly by
// itself; CSS has no per-side outline. So the doubling has to be something
// ELSE painting over the near edge, or the ring's own edge being clipped
// there and nowhere else.
//
// THE ONE STRUCTURAL THING THE DIALOG NEVER HAD: `FormShellDialog`'s
// `SheetContent` carries BOTH the entrance `transform` (`.motion-sheet`,
// `translateX(...)`, still present at rest too — a CSS animation with
// `both` leaves its END keyframe's transform applied indefinitely, not
// removed) AND, until this fix, its own `overflow-hidden` — on the SAME
// element, which also sits flush against the viewport on three of its four
// sides (`inset-y-0 end-0`). A transformed element with its own overflow
// clip is exactly the shape of a known compositor pitfall: the browser can
// rasterise that element's layer to a snapshot bound to the transform's
// OWN geometry, and a ring that appears (autofocus lands the instant the
// panel mounts, before the entrance settles) can get clipped or double-
// painted a device pixel or two into the layer's own near edge. The centred
// `Dialog` this replaced never had the co-occurrence: it animates too
// (`motion-rise-in`, also `both`), but it sits margined away from every
// viewport edge, so there was nothing for the two to collide against. And
// only the NEAR (start) side is ever visible either way: the other three
// sides of the ring sit at or past the viewport boundary for a right-anchored
// sheet, so the same class of artifact on any other edge would be invisible
// against the window, not merely absent — which is why a symmetric cause
// reads as an asymmetric report.
//
// THE FIX SEPARATES THE TWO JOBS ONTO TWO ELEMENTS, which is the standard
// remedy for this pitfall: the `transform` stays on `SheetContent` (it has
// to — Radix owns that element), and `overflow-hidden` moves OFF it,
// leaving containment entirely to FormShell's own `<form
// data-slot="sheet-form">` one level in — already `overflow-hidden` and
// already sized to the exact same box (`fill` → `h-full`, `p-0` on
// `SheetContent`), so nothing is left unclipped; it is just clipped by a
// STATIC element the compositor never has to reconcile against a moving
// transform. Not a CSS override of the symptom (no new box-shadow, no
// hand-tuned inset) — the ring keeps drawing exactly where tokens.css §8
// already puts it, on a box that no longer shares a paint layer with the
// thing animating around it.
//
// THE SECOND, UNRELATED COMPLAINT ON THE SAME SCREENSHOT: "make them wider,
// consider a fix % of the screen." The panel's width lived in the vendored
// `sheet.tsx` (`w-[26.25rem]`, a flat 420px on every monitor) — fine to
// override from here via `className` (tailwind-merge, not a hand-edit of
// `shared/ui/`), wrong to leave flat. See the width comment on `SheetContent`
// below for the actual bounds chosen.
//
// ── A REAL CANCEL BUTTON, AND THE TWO RULES STOP BEING STROKES, 2026-08-31 ──
//
// Three more items off the same client pass.
//
// 1 · "on add/edit - also put the cancel button there. I know I can click
// out, but also add it." There was never a Cancel control in this shell's
// action bar — dismissal was ONLY the Sheet's own backdrop/Escape path, which
// a keyboard user or a screen reader has no way to discover and a mouse user
// on a maximised window has to travel a long way to reach. The kit's own
// `shared/ui/components/form/form.tsx` already draws exactly this job, with
// `variant="cancel"` — button.tsx's own word for "the quiet dismissal beside
// a primary" — rendered BEFORE its submit button. `CancelButton` below
// mirrors that call site byte for byte and wires to the SAME close path the
// Sheet's own `onOpenChange` already runs (busy refuses it, same as today),
// so "click out" and "press Cancel" are one decision seen through two doors,
// never two that can drift. Rendered only when a caller passes `onCancel` —
// today that is `FormShellDialog` alone; the two bare-`FormShell` callers
// (`access-tokens.tsx`'s centred `Dialog`, `web-portal/components/needs-name.tsx`'s
// mandatory onboarding step, which has nothing to cancel TO) pass none and
// gain nothing, which is correct for both.
//
// 2 · "the lines that separate the bottom buttons and the title, make them
// like in the screenshot: a lighter gray, not the black." Both dividers
// here were a bare Tailwind `border-t` — a STROKE, and one with no
// `border-{color}` utility naming a token, so its colour was never
// `--border` at all: Tailwind v4's own preflight leaves an unnamed border at
// `currentColor` (foreground ink), which is exactly "black" against this
// shell's paper. Every hairline drawn anywhere else in the vendored kit is an
// INSET SHADOW, never a border (`shared/ui/docs/BUILD-A-SCREEN.md`: "Separation
// is a fill or an inset shadow, never a stroke") — `FormActions` in the kit's
// own `form.tsx` draws the identical top-of-action-bar rule as
// `shadow-[var(--hairline-over)]`. Both `border-t`s below become that, which
// both fixes the reported colour (`--hair`, the pale 8%-opacity token) and
// brings this hand-built shell in line with the rule every vendored
// composition already follows.
//
// 3 · "on form's required field, put required on the left total left, not
// like now in the immediate left of the title." The marker is drawn by the
// kit's own vendored, pinned Field component (under `shared/ui/`,
// `data-slot="field-required"`, a sibling of the label in one `flex
// items-baseline gap-2` row) — hand-editing it fails
// `web/test/vendored-kit.test.ts` by design, and it exposes no prop for this.
// So this is THE OWNER'S OVERRIDE, APP-SIDE ONLY, same technique as
// `web/components/shell/auth-card.tsx`'s: a descendant selector reaching the kit's
// own stable `data-slot`, applied from a wrapper the kit never sees. It lands
// on the ONE scrolling body div every form's fields already flow through
// (below), which is why one selector reaches every field of every one of
// this shell's 37 callers rather than 37 edits.
//
// ── AND THE SAME RULING, REVERSED, 2026-09-07 ───────────────────────────────
//
// CLIENT, verbatim, on the ticket form: "title always left, required always
// right." That is the mirror image of point 3 above, from the same person
// eight days later, and it is why the sentence above is KEPT rather than
// rewritten: the shape she asked for in August is what she is now correcting,
// and a note that pretends the first ruling never happened is a note that
// invites somebody to "fix" this back next month.
//
// SEEN, NOT INFERRED (localhost against staging, 2026-09-07). Every required
// field in every one of this shell's dialogs was drawing its label row as
// `Required` hard against the left edge and the label pushed to the far
// right — computed `order: -9999`, `margin-right: 160.9px` on the marker of a
// field whose label read "What do you need help with?". On the ticket form
// that put the word `Required` directly under the TITLE box and 169px away
// from the word `Module` it actually belongs to, which is the "the module
// selector is broken" the client reported and attached a screenshot of. It
// was never the module picker: it was this one selector, on every field of
// every form, and the module row is simply where she happened to be looking.
//
// So the pair flips and nothing else changes. `order-last` puts the marker at
// the row's TRAILING edge (flex `order` matches on the element itself
// regardless of which ancestor's class named the selector); `ms-auto`
// (margin-inline-START, the mirror of the `me-auto` it replaces, so it still
// reverses correctly in Arabic, Urdu and Persian) claims the free space
// BEFORE the marker, which pushes it to the far end and leaves the label
// alone at the leading edge — "always left" and "always right", the two ends
// of one row, rather than the two glued together at `gap-2`.
//
// ── AND THE KIT OWNS IT NOW, v1.2.69, VENDORED 2026-09-08 ──────────────────
//
// The paragraph that used to stand here said the honest fix was upstream and
// was one line: the kit Field's own label header row wants `justify-between`,
// with `min-w-0` on the label and `shrink-0` on the marker so a long label
// truncates instead of shoving it off the end. (The path is deliberately not
// spelt out — `wrapped-strings.test.ts` bans that substring from every file
// but the seam that imports it.) That landed in design kit v1.2.69, in exactly
// those three classes, and its CHANGELOG names this override as the thing to
// delete. IT IS DELETED: the scrolling body div below no longer carries
// `[&_[data-slot=field-required]]:order-last` or the `ms-auto` beside it, and
// the app reaches into no kit slot for this any more.
//
// AND THE KIT'S VERSION IS STRICTLY BETTER, which is why this is not a lateral
// move. `ms-auto` claimed the free space before the marker and did nothing
// when there was none: a flex item refuses to shrink below its content width,
// so a long label still shoved the marker off the end. `min-w-0` on the label
// is the half the app could not say from outside without reaching a SECOND
// slot, and it is what makes a long label truncate instead.
//
// THE TWO RULINGS ABOVE ARE KEPT, not deleted with the code they explain —
// August's "required on the left total left" and its 7 Sep reversal, "title
// always left, required always right". They are WHY the kit's row is shaped
// the way it is, and a note that pretends they never happened is a note that
// invites somebody to "fix" this back next month. What changed on 8 Sep is
// only WHERE the sentence is said: in the component that draws the row,
// instead of in a selector reaching it from outside.
//
// ── THE ✕ WAS A SECOND CANCEL, AND THE SUBTITLE WENT WITH IT, 2026-08-31 ────
//
// Two more, off the same client pass, both scoped to `FormShellDialog` only
// (the bare `FormShell` callers — `access-tokens.tsx`'s centred `Dialog`,
// `web-portal/components/needs-name.tsx`'s onboarding step — have no Cancel button and
// are untouched).
//
// 1 · "on add/edit, we do not need the x on top (we already have the cancel
// for that)." True the moment `CancelButton` shipped, above: the Sheet's own
// top-right ✕ (`sheet.tsx`'s `OVERLAY_CLOSE`, `data-slot="sheet-close-
// button"`) and the footer's Cancel now run the SAME `close()` — two controls
// for one decision. The kit's `SheetContent` already takes a `showClose`
// prop for exactly this (`shared/ui/compositions/overlays/access-denied.tsx`
// and `components/command/command.tsx` both already pass `showClose={false}`
// when their own close affordance exists elsewhere) — a prop, not a
// hand-edit of the vendored file. Passed here so it reaches all ~37 real
// `FormShellDialog` callers from the one seam they share.
//
// 2 · "on add/edit screens we do not need subtitles." Every one of this
// shell's real callers builds its own sentence — the ticket form's "Describe
// the problem you're facing…" is one of ~37 distinct strings, never a shared
// default — but ALL of them reach the screen through this one component's
// `subtitle` prop, which is the ONLY place that value is ever rendered
// (`FormShell`'s header `{subtitle}` line, below). So rather than deleting
// the prop and its now-dead JSX from ~37 call sites (`*-form-dialog.tsx`,
// plus the two generic wrappers `InternalRecordDialog` and `RateFormDialog`
// that fan out to a further nine), `subtitle` stays in the type — every
// existing caller keeps compiling unchanged, gate #4's smallest shape — and
// is simply never forwarded to `FormShell` below. `FormShell` itself is
// untouched and still renders a subtitle for its two bare callers, neither
// of which passed one through this path.

 *
 * ── BUSY IS NOT DISABLED, AND THE KIT HAS A WORD FOR EACH ─────────────────
 *
 * This button used to fold `busy` into `disabled`, and the kit's Button reads

 * and grey label, identical on all eight variants. So the instant you pressed
 * Submit on any of the thirty-eight forms R4 routes through this shell, the
 * one mango control on the screen went grey. It reads as "switched off", which
 * is the opposite of what is happening: the save is in flight and the press
 * WORKED.
 *
 * The kit already draws the distinction and states it as a rule (button.tsx,
 * state 6): "loading — variant fill kept, spinner, aria-busy", implemented as
 * `showDisabledSkin = disabled && !loading`. So `busy` goes to `loading` and
 * only a genuinely unanswerable form goes to `disabled`. Both still refuse the
 * press — the kit disables the element for either — and `loading` adds the
 * `aria-busy` a screen reader needs, which the old spelling never said.
 *
 * The spinner and the busy word come from the kit too: it draws its own ring
 * and swaps in `loadingLabel`, so the hand-held `<Spinner>` and the ternary
 * that chose between two labels are both gone. The two sentences are still
 * asked for at this position (R33) and are unchanged. */

      {/* side="right": the app's other 18 Sheet call sites all open from the
          same edge. WIDTH, 2026-08-31: the kit's own default (`w-[26.25rem]`,
          420 flat) is overridden here rather than in the vendored `sheet.tsx` —
          a fixed pixel measure on "I have a very big monitor" read as
          "ridiculous", so the panel now SCALES: `clamp(26.25rem, 34vw, 40rem)`
          keeps today's 420px as the FLOOR (small screens are no worse off),
          tracks 34% of the viewport in between, and stops at 640px — a notch
          above the kit's own `templates/form-screen.tsx` "edit" panel
          (`32rem`/512px), which is this app's one reference for "generous, not
          absurd" without adopting that composition (COMPOSITION-MISMATCHES.md).
          `max-w-[min(100%,40rem)]` replaces the kit's own `max-w-full`: on a
          view narrower than the 420px floor a plain `max-w-full` still caps at
          100vw (that half of the mobile full-bleed rule is untouched), and
          `min(...)` adds the SAME 640px ceiling on the wide end so the two
          bounds can never fight. Neither new class sets `mx-auto` or the bare
          token `w-full`, so R29's positional scan (which fires on exactly that
          trio on one line) still does not see a page container here — a sheet
          keeps its own measure on purpose; verified by re-running
          `one-page-width` after this change, not assumed.
          p-0: SheetContent's own per-child rule already skips FormShell (its
          `data-slot="sheet-form"`). overflow-hidden is DELIBERATELY NOT set
          here any more — see the note on FormShell's own `<form>` above for why
          clipping moved off this element.
          showClose={false}: the panel's own top-right ✕ is withdrawn — see
          "THE ✕ WAS A SECOND CANCEL" note at the top of this file. The footer's
          CancelButton (below) is the one dismiss control now; the kit's own
          `showClose` prop is exactly the seam `access-denied.tsx` and
          `command.tsx` already use for the same reason, so this is not a
          hand-edit of vendored `sheet.tsx`. */}
