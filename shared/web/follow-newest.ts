"use client"

// FOLLOW THE NEWEST MESSAGE — the one behaviour that makes a thread read like a
// conversation instead of a list, shared by both front doors' ticket screens.
//
// Replies append at the bottom, which is right, but until now the view didn't
// move: you opened a request with a dozen replies and landed on the oldest one,
// then sent a reply and watched nothing happen (owner, staging portal, Aug
// 2026). Every chat app these clients already use lands on the newest message
// and follows what they send.
//
// It lives in shared/web/ rather than in either app because the agency thread
// and the client thread are the same conversation seen from two sides — the day
// one of them changed how it follows, the other would have been a bug report.

 * newest message is one THEY just sent — they acted, so following is what they
 * expect, and it is the one case that must win even from the top of a long
 * thread. Yes when they were already at the end anyway.
 *
 * No otherwise, and that clause is the whole reason this is a function rather
 * than an unconditional scroll: someone who has deliberately scrolled up to
 * re-read what they asked for must not be yanked to the bottom because a reply
 * landed live. (Both library thread components — Chat and Comments — set

/** WHICH BOX THE THREAD IS IN — and it is no longer the same answer on both
 * doors, which is why this is a function and not two lines inlined twice.
 *
 * THE AGENCY DOOR'S THREAD IS A BOUNDED PANE, `TicketConversationPanel`'s own
 * `CardContent` (`web/components/tickets/ticket-detail-body.tsx`), marked
 * `[data-thread-scroll]`. It used to be `[data-slot="screen-shell-body"]`
 * instead — right while that element WAS the thread's own scroller (kit
 * v1.2.28, `ScreenShell` drew the window `h-dvh overflow-hidden`), wrong from
 * R89 round 28 on: `screen-shell-body` became the WHOLE ticket page's one
 * scroll region, so landing on the newest reply on open scrolled the entire
 * page to the bottom — composer visible, title and stages gone (T3841, 21 Sep
 * 2026). `[data-thread-scroll]` names the actual bounded box (R91's own
 * "chat thread" exception) so this only ever moves the transcript, never the
 * page around it.
 *
 * THE PORTAL DOOR STILL SCROLLS THE DOCUMENT. `portal-shell.tsx` lays out with
 * `min-h-[100svh]` and lets the page scroll, and the reasoning is still true
 * there: the thread IS the page, a nested scroller would trap a thumb on a
 * phone, and scrolling the document to its end puts the sticky bottom nav
 * back in its natural place under the composer. It carries no
 * `[data-thread-scroll]` of its own, so the query below finds nothing and
 * every caller below falls to the `document` branch, unchanged.
 *
 * So the box is asked for rather than assumed, and both doors get the same
 * behaviour out of whichever one they have. `null` means the document, which is
 * also what the login screen, onboarding and the error boundary have. */
