"use client"

// FilterBar — the app's binding to the DESIGN KIT's own filter row.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS A REWRITE AND NOT A RESKIN ───────────────────────────────────
//
// Until now this file drew a filter row of its OWN: a wrapping strip of compact
// dropdown triggers, one per facet, each opening a popover, with a "Clear all"
// on the end. The kit ships
// `shared/ui/components/filter-bar/filter-bar.tsx` — `FilterBar`,
// `SearchableFacet` and `RangeFacet`, the SAME THREE NAMES — and nothing in
// `web/`, `web-portal/` or `shared/web/` imported a line of it. So every other
// control in this app converges with the designer's build by construction, and
// this one could not, because we were not drawing her component at all. This
// file is now an ADAPTER: it decides nothing about how a filter LOOKS, and the
// three files that used to (`filter-bar` + `range-facet` + `searchable-facet`,
// 618 lines) are one file of wiring.
//
// ── THE POPOVER IS GONE — CLIENT RULING, 2026-09-02 ──────────────────────────
//
// Until that night the "+ filter"/count slot opened a floating, portaled
// Popover holding every facet's own control, stacked one per line. The client,
// against a confirmed mockup: the slot now toggles a SECOND ROW open directly
// under the WHOLE toolbar — not a popover, not an overlay, an actual sibling
// line. Nothing about the facet controls THEMSELVES changed to do this: every
// facet was already rendered by mapping `facets` once, in one place
// (`RangeFacet`/`CompactFacet`, below), so the panel already showed every
// facet's own field at once. And nothing here inserts an "Apply" step: a pick
// calls `onChange` directly, which is what the client asked to keep — "the
// moment I select sth on a dropdown its applied", and, the same day, "remember
// we dont want apply buton".
//
// ── THE PANEL'S GEOMETRY, IN THREE PASSES. READ ALL THREE ────────────────────
//
// PASS ONE — A FLEX SIBLING INSIDE THE PILL, AND THE BLOB. The first cut made
// the panel a genuine flex child of the toolbar's own `rounded-pill` TRACK
// (this component's root was a `<>` fragment for exactly that). It solved
// WIDTH — the panel's `w-full` finally meant the whole pill once nothing
// capped it — and broke HEIGHT: the panel is several facets deep, `flex-wrap`
// folded it onto a second line INSIDE the pill's own box, and a `rounded-pill`
// (999px) box that tall draws a stadium wide enough to read as a giant oval
// with the controls scattered around it. Caught live on a screenshot; the
// client's words were "lol what is this shit".
//
// PASS TWO — `position: absolute`, AND THE OVERLAY. The fix was to take the
// panel out of normal flow entirely (`absolute inset-x-0 top-full` against a
// `relative` track), so its height could never reach the pill's box model no
// matter how many facets a screen adds. That held the pill's shape and cost
// the other half of the behaviour: an open panel FLOATED over the collection
// instead of moving it, which the client then ruled on — verbatim, 2026-09-02:
// "the expanded toolbar shoudl not be an overlay, but literaly expand the
// space".
//
// PASS THREE — THE COLUMN, WHICH IS NEITHER OF THE TWO. Both earlier passes
// took the same thing for granted: that the panel's only possible parent is
// the pill track. It is not. A column wrapping a host's toolbar in a plain
// `flex-col`, whose children are (a) the pill track, unchanged and still
// fixed-shape, and (b) the panel rendered as its own sibling beneath it, makes
// the panel a NORMAL-FLOW SIBLING of the track rather than a child of it: it
// occupies real space and pushes the collection down (the ruling), and its
// height feeds the COLUMN's box model and never the pill's, because the pill
// is a different box — pass one's bug is structurally impossible now rather
// than merely unlikely. Deleting `absolute`/`top-full` and stopping there is
// pass one again, so `web/test/filter-row-is-the-kits.test.tsx` locks the
// difference: it renders the real `ToolbarRow`, opens the panel, and asserts
// the pill track's own subtree is byte-identical open and closed and never
// contains the panel.
//
// PASS FOUR, SUPERSEDING PASS THREE'S OWN MECHANISM — v1.2.27. Pass three's
// column reached its outlet through a PORTAL: the "Filter" pill has to sit
// INSIDE the track (it is a toolbar control) and the panel has to sit OUTSIDE
// it, and a React element renders into exactly one parent, so a bespoke
// context (`PanelSlot` + `FilterPanelProvider` + `FilterPanelOutlet` +
// `FilterPanelColumn`, ~62 lines) published a DOM node for `createPortal` to
// target — built because neither `ToolbarRow` (screen-bits.tsx) nor the
// kit's own `CollectionFrame` offered a real position to hand a panel node
// to. `CollectionFrame` gained one (`toolbarPanel`) the same release this
// facet work landed in, which is the proof a portal was never the point —
// a POSITION was. `useFilterBar` below returns `{ pill, panel }` as two
// ordinary values instead of rendering both itself, so the CALLER holds both
// pieces already and can hand each to wherever it belongs — `filters` and
// `toolbarPanel`, on `ToolbarRow` or on the kit's `CollectionFrame` directly —
// in one render pass, with no context and no portal. `web/test/filter-row-
// is-the-kits.test.tsx`'s byte-identical assertion above WAS true of the
// track's own subtree at the time and is SUPERSEDED below (pass five) — the
// track stopped carrying its own fill/shape at all, which is a stronger
// property than "unchanged", not a weaker one.
//
// PASS FIVE, SUPERSEDING PASS THREE AND FOUR'S "TWO BOXES" SHAPE — CLIENT
// RULING, 2026-09-03. Verbatim: "what this is doing is creating a new card
// underneath... it kind of creates a second toolbar. This is not the
// behaviour I want. I want it to look together, so merge this with the main
// toolbar so that it's one single background or container, more like expand
// behaviour rather than open-a-new-one behaviour."
//
// Passes three and four solved OVERLAY (the panel is in normal flow and
// pushes the collection down) and left a second fault standing: the track
// and this panel were two `bg-background` boxes — the track `rounded-pill`,
// this panel `rounded-[var(--radius)]` — with a `gap-2` between them. Same
// fill, same tone, visibly separate: precisely "a second toolbar" no matter
// how correctly the overlay question was answered. The fix is NOT pass one
// again (the panel is still never a flex child of the pill, still never feeds
// anything's height into a `rounded-pill` calc) — it is giving the fill and
// the shape to exactly ONE element, the caller's own merged container, and
// having THAT element's shape read off `Boolean(panel)` rather than off any
// box's measured height. `ToolbarRow` (screen-bits.tsx) does this now: one
// `bg-[var(--surface-raised)]` div (fixed off `bg-background` since this pass
// landed — see the same correction below, and check screen-bits.tsx directly
// before trusting a token name in a comment about another file), `rounded-
// pill` with no panel and `rounded-[var(--radius)]` the moment one exists,
// the track and this panel
// both painting nothing of their own. This panel's own div lost its
// `bg-background`/`rounded-[var(--radius)]` for the same reason — see its
// own comment, below. `web/test/filter-row-is-the-kits.test.tsx`'s "the panel
// expands the space" test is rewritten for this pass rather than dropped:
// the pill-inside-the-track regression (pass one) and the floating-overlay
// regression (pass two) are both still asserted against; what changed is
// that the track's OWN box now legitimately carries no fill or radius in
// either state, and the single merged container's radius is asserted to
// switch instead of staying byte-identical.
//
// ── THE TOOLBAR SAYS A COUNT, NEVER THE FILTERS — CLIENT RULING, 2026-09-02 ──
//
// Verbatim: "when activce filters, do not display them in the toolbar. only a
// count niside the filter pill (like in artifact)". So the kit's CHIP HALF —
// one removable chip per active facet, which this adapter used to build out of
// `facets` + `values` — is not rendered at all. `KitFilterBar` is still what
// draws the row, with no `filters` and no `onRemove`: what survives is its
// "+ filter" slot, which is the pill, reading `Filter` or `Filter (3)`.
//
// What went with the chips, deliberately and completely: the `said` ref that
// remembered a picked value's WORDS so a chip could not end up naming a ULID
// after its option left the loaded page (nothing names a value any more, so
// there is nothing to go stale), `rangeSaid` that turned a numeric bound into
// chip text, the per-chip remove control and its `t("Remove filter: {what}")`
// sentence, and the wrapped-and-truncated chip label. A count cannot clip and
// cannot go stale, which is most of what those existed to survive.
//
// ── WHERE "CLEAR FILTERS" WENT, AND WHY THERE IS STILL EXACTLY ONE ───────────
//
// It was the kit's own control at the end of the chip row, and the kit only
// draws it when there ARE chips (`hasChips` in the kit's file), so with the
// chips gone that control cannot appear and passing `onClear` would be dead
// wiring. The two places it could go are beside the pill, or inside the panel.
//
// IT IS INSIDE THE PANEL, with the fields it clears. Three reasons, in order
// of weight. First, the row it used to belong to is gone: beside the pill it
// would be a second toolbar control that appears and disappears with the
// filter state, changing the track's own contents underneath a person — and
// the pill's count already reports that state, so the toolbar would be saying
// the same thing twice in two shapes. Second, clearing is an edit to the
// facets, and the facets are in the panel; a control standing where the thing
// it acts on is visible is the whole of why the kit drew it beside the chips
// in the first place. Third, the client's own reference artifact draws a Clear
// inside the panel. It is also the reading that keeps the app honest about
// "exactly one": the no-results register already offers its own "Clear
// filters" when a narrowed collection comes back empty
// (`collection-frame.tsx`), and a toolbar control would stand beside that one
// permanently, where this one is on screen only while somebody has the panel
// open.
//
// ── THE THREE TOOLBAR PILLS ARE ONE FAMILY — CLIENT RULING, 2026-09-02,
// SUPERSEDED v1.2.27 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Verbatim: "the filter button-pill it's still differnet than the other 2. fix
// and uniform it". MEASURED, not eyeballed, against the two pills standing
// beside it — `SortControl`'s field and `ViewSwitch`, which both draw through
// the kit's `SelectTrigger` and both override it the same way:
//
//                     Filter (kit `CHIP_ADD`)      Sort / View (`SelectTrigger`)
//   height            40 (--control-height-button) 40  — already equal
//   radius            rounded-pill                 rounded-pill — already equal
//   resting fill      --btn-secondary-fill         --btn-secondary-fill — equal
//   inline padding    12 (px-3)                    18 (--space-4h)
//   type step         12 (--text-badge), leading 1 14 (--text-sm), leading 1.45
//   weight            inherited (300)              500 (--font-weight-medium)
//
// So three real differences, every one of them making the pill read SMALLER,
// plus a fourth this file was itself causing: the hover override that used to
// live here forced `--accent` onto the add slot. That was right when the kit
// drew that slot with `bg-transparent` (a 5% wash tinting the page behind it)
// and is wrong now that it is an opaque `--btn-secondary-fill` pill — the wash
// REPLACES the fill rather than tinting it, and measured against the dark
// palette it comes out darker than resting, i.e. the pill dimming on hover
// where the other two light up. The kit already hovers it to
// `--btn-secondary-hover`, the same token the other two use, so the override
// is deleted rather than corrected.
//
// THE UPSTREAM FIX LANDED, v1.2.27: the kit's own `CHIP_ADD` now takes
// `SelectTrigger`'s padding, type step and weight the same way it already took
// its height and its fill, closing the three real deltas measured above. The
// app-side override that used to close them here (`FILTER_PILL_MATCHES_THE_OTHER_TWO`,
// reached through the kit's stable `data-slot="filter-bar-add"` hook) is
// therefore deleted along with its application — restating a class the kit
// already states is three lines free to drift out of step with the very thing
// they claim to match, and `web/test/filter-row-is-the-kits.test.tsx` rot-checks
// that it stays gone.
//
// ── ONE COMPOSITION CANNOT MARK ITS OWN SLOT ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The vendored kit's OWN `CollectionFrame` gives `filters` a wrapping box of
// its own and offers no slot BELOW its toolbar, so the engine's `useKitPanel`
// branch puts the outlet at the top of the frame's BODY instead — directly
// under the toolbar, above the rows, which is where the panel belongs and what
// the ruling asks for. A slot of the frame's own between toolbar and body is
// the upstream fix, logged for the design-kit pipeline.
//
// ── WHAT THE APP'S FACET CONTRACT IS, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED ───────────
//
// Every facet in either front door is `control: "select"`, single-valued, with
// options either declared (a closed door vocabulary — `web/lib/collection-
// filters.ts`) or derived from the loaded rows (`facetOptions`). Nothing sets
// `control: "chips"`, nothing sets `control: "range"`, and nothing sets
// `onSearch`. The async option-provider, its debounce, its request-id race
// guard and the whole chips branch were three code paths no screen reached, so
// they are gone rather than ported. `control: "range"` STAYS, because
// `selectRows` compiles it and the kit draws it.
//
// ── A FACET IS A COMPACT FIELD, NOT AN EXPANDED LIST — CLIENT RULING,
// 2026-09-02, AGAINST HER OWN CONFIRMED ARTIFACT. SUPERSEDED IN PART, v1.2.27 ─
//
// `control: "select"` was drawn by the kit's `SearchableFacet`, which is an
// always-expanded panel: a heading, a search pill, then every option as a
// checkbox row. Two facets of it is a full screen of controls hanging under a
// toolbar, and it is what the client's screenshot caught — a "Search client…"
// box over a scrolling list of every client, where her artifact draws one
// short labelled field reading "Any client". The declared control said
// `select` all along; nothing was drawing one. So on 2026-09-02 this file
// composed one out of the kit's own `Select` — a hand-assembled compact field,
// not a hand-rolled trigger, but still this adapter's own composition rather
// than a kit part with a name.
//
// v1.2.27 CLOSED THE GAP UPSTREAM: the kit shipped `CompactFacet` — "one short
// field, and the same filtered list `SearchableFacet` draws, behind it" (the
// kit's own header, `components/filter-bar/filter-bar.tsx`) — built from the
// SAME `selectTriggerVariants` recipe the sort and view pills stand on, so a
// compact facet beside them cannot drift from them the way `CHIP_ADD` did.
// This file's own hand-assembled `Select` composition is deleted in favour of
// it: `SelectFacet` and its `ANY_VALUE` sentinel are gone, and the facet
// branch below draws `<CompactFacet>` directly. `CompactFacet` already draws
// its own `role="group"` + `FacetLabel` frame — matching `RangeFacet`'s, so
// the two facet kinds still read as one family — so this file no longer wraps
// one of its own around it either.
//
// AND THE FEATURE THE FIRST CUT COST COMES BACK. `CompactFacet` is optionally
// `searchable`: the SAME filtered list `SearchableFacet` draws, now reachable
// from behind a short trigger instead of paying for it with an
// always-expanded panel. Waves' own note ("an agency with 131 clients on
// staging") is exactly the case a plain `Select` could not serve — a Radix
// select scrolls and takes type-ahead but does not search — so `wave-finder.tsx`
// turns `searchable` on for its Company facet. The kit's own guidance
// ("`searchable` defaults to FALSE — a facet over eight words does not need a
// search field, and drawing one there would be a control that never earns its
// keystroke") sets the threshold this adapter measures against: `searchable`
// is on wherever a facet's OWN option count exceeds eight, computed per facet
// rather than guessed at a call site, so a vocabulary that grows past the
// threshold turns its own facet searchable without anybody revisiting it.
//
// ── SINGLE-SELECT, AND WHY IT IS NOT A THEMING DECISION ──────────────────────
//
// The doors take one value per query parameter and validate it positionally
// (R20); a comma list would be a change to six doors, their filter parity on
// the machine surface (R19) and their tests. Both the old `Select` composition
// and the kit's own `CompactFacet` are single-valued by construction — and the
// day a door learns a list, this adapter is still the one place that changes.
//
// CLEARING A FACET IS `null` NOW, NOT A SENTINEL STRING. The old `Select`
// composition needed `ANY_VALUE`, a two-underscore placeholder, because Radix
// reserves the empty string for `SelectItem`'s own placeholder state and
// throws if an item declares it — a workaround for a control that speaks in
// strings only. `CompactFacet`'s own `value`/`onValueChange` speak `string |
// null`, `null` already meaning "off" (its own contract: "`null` is the
// facet turned off"), so there is no reserved string to dodge and nothing to
// convert through a sentinel — only the boundary conversion every facet still
// needs, because the app's OWN convention, shared with every door and every
// other facet in this file, is `""` for off: `null` in, `""` out, both ways,
// where this file calls `CompactFacet`.

  // behind the number." That reference shape is `Badge`'s own counter
  // geometry (`size="counter"`: `h-5 min-w-5 px-2`, `rounded-pill`,
  // `variant="default"` for the mango fill) — the same shape `TabsCount`'s
  // active state and `CollectionFrame`'s heading count already wear
  // (GAPS-RULINGS.md R-4a). `TabsCount` itself does not fit here: its
  // mango-vs-quiet switch is `group-data-[state=active]/tab:` CSS read off a
  // Radix `Tabs`-internal ancestor this filter row has no reason to
  // construct, so an unwrapped `<TabsCount>` would draw only its OFF state.
  // `Badge` needs none of that — it is already a standalone export
  // (`CollectionFrame`'s own heading count is a bare `<Badge count={…} />`)
  // — so this reaches for `Badge` directly rather than restyling a clone of
  // it.
  //
  // What stood between this pill and that badge was `KitFilterBar`'s own
  // "+ filter" button: its `addFilterLabel` prop is typed `string`, rendered
  // as bare text with no slot for a node. `addFilterBadge` (kit v1.2.33) is
  // the fix — an ADDITIVE sibling prop beside `addFilterLabel`, so every
  // other call site of `KitFilterBar` is byte-identical with it omitted.
  // `Badge` already renders nothing at zero (the kit's own zero law), which
  // is why `addFilterLabel` stays the plain, un-numbered "Filter" rather
  // than folding the count into the sentence a second time.
