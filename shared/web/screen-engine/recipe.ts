// =============================================================================
// Screen recipes — the serializable contract for the config-driven SCREEN ENGINE.
//
// A `ScreenRecipe` describes a whole screen as DATA: which module it binds to,
// the fields, the actions, who may see it (gating), and how it's presented. The
// engine (registry/collections/screen-renderer) renders a recipe by COMPOSING
// the library's existing collections + primitives — so screens are served at
// runtime and reconfigured without a code deploy.
//
// This file is pure (types + URL/gating helpers, no React) so the LIBRARY owns
// the contract and the consuming app just imports it. The engine renders recipes
// and speaks the URL grammar; it does NOT fetch data, call APIs, store recipes,
// or own the router — those are the host app's job.
// =============================================================================
