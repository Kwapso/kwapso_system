   * anywhere but on the footer … this would open a slide-in with all the
   * activity"; 2026-09-07: "kill all old activity tabs"), no recipe declares

   * front doors, where `@/` resolves to two different folders. So the door
   * comes IN, exactly as the panel used to, and for the same constraint. The
   * kit says the same thing from its own side: `activityAction` "supplies the
   * PLACE, the TYPE STEP, the LEADING and the INK. It does not supply the
   * control" — a kit component must not own a string or a navigation, and
   * neither may an engine that is shared by two products.
   *
   * The PORTAL passes nothing and gets nothing: it renders no record activity
   * at all (`PORTAL_ACTIVITY_EXEMPT` — the door is not on the portal
   * gateway's surface), and an omitted node leaves that column's eyebrow

            sit here are both settled upstream.

            IT USED TO BE RESTATED, NOT IMPORTED. `shared/ui/components/dialog/
            dialog.tsx` built the identical expression into its own
            module-private `SCRIM` and did not export it, so this layer mixed
            its own charcoal by hand — the fourth of five call sites doing
            exactly that. Kit v1.2.69 gave the value a NAME (`--scrim` /
            `--scrim-drawer`, bridged as `bg-scrim` / `bg-scrim-drawer`) for
            that reason, and tokens.css's own §3 note records the fifth
            consumer (`edge-panel.tsx`) as what forced it. So this reads the
            kit's name instead of re-deriving the kit's value, which is also
            what the kit's palette law asks for: `--kw-charcoal` is the RAW
            ramp, and §8.3 keeps the ramp to tokens.css.

            AND THE HAND-MIX WAS A LIVE TRAP, not only off-vocabulary.
            Tailwind compiles an arbitrary `color-mix` into a PAIR — the
            un-mixed colour, then an `@supports (color: color-mix(in lab, red,
            red))` block carrying the real value — so a browser without
            `color-mix` got FULLY OPAQUE CHARCOAL where a 36% dim was asked
            for: a black screen over the record rather than a graceful
            degradation. tokens.css states the token as `rgba(26, 25, 24, .36)`
            precisely so no call site can emit that pair, and this was one of
            the sites it was measured against.

            A literal `bg-black/50` sat here before the hand-mix — un-tokenised
            (R32) and visibly cooler/darker than every other overlay's scrim
            side by side. Kept at this layer's own z-50, not the kit modal's
            z-60: only the colour is meant to match, not the stacking. */}

  // the same table in the same order, and hands the result to the kit's own
  // `RecordDetailTab.icon` slot — the pass-through the kit added for exactly

  // NO MARK ON A RECORD TITLE — CLIENT RULING, 2026-09-01, VERBATIM: "for now

  //
  // This engine used to build an `<Avatar>` here whenever the recipe declared a
  // picture column, and hand it to `RecordDetail`'s `mark`. Two recipes feed it
  // a real picture (`web/lib/screens.ts`: the team's logo on `team.detail`, a
  // member's photo on `members.detail`), so the app's own landing screen and
  // every member page kept drawing one for days after the ruling — because the
  // ruling was implemented in the BESPOKE path only, where
  // `web/components/records/record-chrome.tsx` marks its `mark`/`leading` props "NO
  // LONGER READ BY THIS COMPONENT" and hands the kit nothing. Same ruling, same
  // outcome, both paths.
  //
  // `ScreenHeader.avatar` / `avatarShape` stay on the recipe type for exactly
  // the reason record-chrome keeps its two: the recipes that declare them are
  // in another file, the ruling says "for now", and removing the fields would
  // force an edit at every declaring site to delete something already inert.
  // Nothing in this engine reads them any more — see their own doc comments.
  //
  // The row/tile/picker marks this ruling never reached are untouched:
  // `recipe.leading` still fills a list row's leading slot (R35), and
  // `recipe.image` still feeds the gallery display. It is TITLES that carry no
  // picture.

      /* THE RECORD'S HISTORY, ON THE FOOTER AND NOWHERE ELSE — client ruling,

         but on the footer, on top of the dates. On the right column, on Latest
         Activity, I would like some view or expand or whatever, and this would
         open a slide-in with all the activity."

         THIS PATH HAD NEITHER HALF OF THAT, AND THE GAP WAS INVISIBLE. The
         thirteen bespoke details have drawn the kit's ink footer since
         2026-08-31 (web/components/records/record-chrome.tsx §"the footer"); this
         engine has always rendered `RecordDetail` with no `audit` and no
         `activity`, so a recipe-driven record (the team's own landing screen,
         a member, an invite, the four agency-internal kinds) showed no footer
         summary at all. While those recipes still carried an Activity TAB
         nobody noticed: the history was one click away. The tab went on
         2026-09-06 and the same screens were left with no route to their
         history whatsoever, which is the half of R14 that is about a person
         rather than a cursor.

         THE ROWS ARE THE ONES THE HOST ALREADY SHAPED. `sets.activity` is fed
         by every detail branch in web/components/deep-link/module-content.tsx
         (`shapeMemberDetail`, `shapeTeamDetail`, `shapeInviteDetail`, and the
         internal shapers) and was being carried and drawn by nothing after the
         tab left. No new read, no new prop, no second fetch — `feedItems` is
         the same mapping the `activity` block uses, and `RecordDetail` takes
         the newest few because CH27.8 says the footer is a summary.

         `activityLabel` IS PASSED SO IT CAN BE TRANSLATED. Left off, the
         column's heading falls through to `RecordDetail`'s own hardcoded
         English, which the translation walk cannot see (R28 never opens
         `shared/ui/`). The same sentence, said once, in the reader's language.

         AND `activityAction` IS THE DOOR — the app's `<ActivityRail>`, handed
         in by the host (see the prop's own note above for why it comes in
         rather than being built here). Omitted — the portal, and any host that
         has not wired one — the row is byte-identical to what it was. */

      /* THE SAME TITLE TREATMENT THE BESPOKE DETAILS WEAR — R52, added
         2026-09-06. `RECORD_TITLE_TREATMENT` (shared/web/record-heading.tsx)
         is the h1/44 step and the 80% title/actions split as ONE string, and
         `web/components/records/record-chrome.tsx` applies exactly this same constant
         to the thirteen hand-composed detail screens.

         WITHOUT IT THIS PATH DREW A DIFFERENT SCREEN FROM THE SAME MODEL.
         Both constants used to be private to record-chrome.tsx, so nothing
         here applied either: `RecordDetail` fell through to the kit's own
         `titleSize = "h3"` default and set every recipe record's name at 24px
         where the bespoke path set it at 44px — five screens, `team.detail`
         (the app's own landing screen) among them, disagreeing with thirteen
         for no reason anybody chose. Nobody could see it in review either,
         because the difference is a DEFAULT on one path and a class on the
         other, and neither file mentions the other.

         IT LANDS ON THE SAME ELEMENT FROM A DIFFERENT ROOT. `RecordChrome`
         (the kit template the bespoke path goes through) puts its className on
         a wrapper ABOVE `[data-slot=record-detail]`; this puts it ON that node.
         Both selectors inside the constant are descendant selectors under
         `[data-slot=title]` / `[data-slot=title-heading]`, which are inside
         `RecordDetail` either way.

         `cn` rather than a template string so tailwind-merge sees `w-full` and
         the arbitrary-variant classes as the separate groups they are. */

/** A whole-screen confirm recipe (`type: "confirm"`), rendered as its own

 *
 *  WHY THIS IS NOT `shared/web/use-confirm.tsx`, the app's canonical confirm.
 *  That hook OWNS the dialog's open state (`ask()` opens it, a successful `run`
 *  closes it) and takes a `run: () => Promise<boolean>` so a refusal can leave
 *  the dialog standing beside its error toast. Neither fits here: this dialog's
 *  openness IS the recipe being on screen — the URL put it there and
 *  `onIntent({ kind: "close" })` takes it away — and the engine's one action
 *  seam is `onAction(id, ctx): void`, deliberately fire-and-forget, so there is
 *  no promise to await and no refusal to hear about. Calling a hook from a
 *  layer whose lifetime the host controls would give the same dialog two owners.
 *
 *  So it MATCHES that hook instead, clause by clause: red through the
 *  component's own `variant` prop (see `confirmVariant`), Cancel disabled while
 *  the action is away, and the go-ahead button replaced by a spinner and
 *  "Working…" the moment it is pressed. That last one is the bug, not the
 *  polish: this dialog does not close itself on press (it is `open` outright,
 *  not Radix-managed), so before the latch below a second click fired the same
 *  write a second time. */
