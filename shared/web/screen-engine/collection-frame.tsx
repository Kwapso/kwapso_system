// CollectionFrame — the shared "chrome" every collection wears. You hand it the
// FULL row array plus a function that renders one page of rows; it applies the
// Glide-style collection config for you:
//   • title           — an optional header
//   • filter / sort    — EXECUTED here (via selectRows) from the config's rules
//   • searchable       — a debounced SearchInput that filters the named columns
//   • userFilter       — a FilterBar of `filterFacets` (the design kit's own
//                        filter row: a chip per facet that is on, and the facet
//                        controls behind its "+ filter" slot)
//   • showCount        — a LIVE "Showing X of Y" that reacts to search + facets
//   • limit            — caps the TOTAL rows (e.g. "only ever show 50")
//   • itemsPerPage     — paginates the (filtered) rows, with a Prev/Next pager
// The data math lives in lib/collection (selectRows) so it stays unit-tested;
// one component so List, Card, Table, etc. all behave identically — no repeat.
//
// SERVER-SIDE seam: pass `serverSide` + `onQueryChange` and the frame stops
// filtering in memory — it emits the (debounced) query + facets and renders
// whatever `data` it's handed, so an app can refetch (?q= / FTS5) later.

 *
 * So the host publishes what it already has — the label it puts on that button,
 * its glyph, and its handler — and the frame reads it where it needs it. A
 * context rather than a prop because the frame is reached through the screen
 * engine, several layers below the host, and threading one optional action
 * through every recipe path would be the same decision written eleven times.
 * It is the arrangement R16's count arbitration already uses for the same

    // gives the WHOLE `search` node one flex slot (`basis-full` below `sm`),
    // so a caption placed beside the input inside that one slot fights the

                  (client ruling, 2026-09-01 — the toolbar spec Aurora
                  approved that night): they ride in the SAME row as
                  search, wrapping only when the viewport is genuinely too
                  narrow, never a designed second tier. This file used to
                  render `filterBar` once, after both branches below, as a
                  full-width sibling row — exactly the shape the client's
                  screenshot of the Apps screen caught: search+sort on one
                  line, a stranded filter chip under it — and this file's own
                  `headerLayout` doc claimed "inline" already put "title,
                  search, and filters together on one wrapping row", which
                  the code never actually did. `filterBar` is wrapped in its
                  own non-growing flex box before it joins either row — the
                  adapter's own outer `<div>` (`filter-bar.tsx`) is `w-full`
                  by design (its chip row is meant to claim a whole line when
                  it IS the line), and a bare `w-full` child inside this flex
                  row would still claim the rest of it and push whatever
                  comes after it (sort, in "inline") onto a line of its own —
                  the same two-row shape one level down. The kit's OWN
                  toolbar (`shared/ui/components/collection-frame/
                  collection-frame.tsx`) wraps its own `filters` slot the
                  identical way, for the identical reason.
                  `headerLayout` still decides where SORT rides — "inline"
                  keeps it beside search+filters on this one row; "stacked"
                  (default) keeps it on its own row below, exactly as before
                  this fix — that split is a title/sort decision this bug is
                  not about, and it stays untouched.
                  `filterPanel` (v1.2.27's `useFilterBar` split) is the OTHER
                  half of `filter-bar.tsx`'s open panel, which is normal-flow
                  now (client ruling, 2 Sep 2026: it expands the space rather
                  than floating over it) — rendered as this column's own last
                  child rather than either layout's inner row, so it lands
                  under the whole desktop header in both — under "stacked"
                  that means below the sort row rather than over it.
                  `hidden sm:flex`: a flex column so `filterPanel` stacks

        // asked, and only the genuinely-empty half offers the create action:
        // pointing at "New ticket" when a filter is hiding twelve of them would
        // be worse than the grey line it replaces.

        // "collectionScreen") rather than the hand-rolled dashed box this used
        // to be — the same register the record screens' empty/error states
        // already draw through. `filtered` picks empty vs no-results for it;

        // — "Clear filters", the exact handler the filter bar's own control
        // runs — rather than the dead end of a sentence with nothing to press.
        // ONLY when a FACET is set: `SearchInput` owns its displayed text
        // itself (`defaultValue`, uncontrolled), so a button that reset the
        // remembered `query` too would tell the reader the box was cleared
        // while the letters they typed stayed on screen. A search-only
        // narrowing keeps the plain sentence, same as before this change.
        //
        // NO ICON HERE ANY MORE — `config.emptyIcon` (a per-recipe glyph) has
        // no seam into `ShapeStateBody`: the composition's own law is "it
        // never draws a mark of its own", which is the kit's considered
        // reading of ch27.21's "no empty-box drawing, no mascot … type and one
        // button carry it". Dropping the icon is that law, not a shim I could
        // not find; a recipe's `emptyIcon` is simply unread from here now.
        //
        // GENUINELY EMPTY draws through `CollectionEmptyState` now (same
        // register `useKitPanel` draws, see its own doc) rather than
        // `ShapeStateBody` — a bold title, the two-routes sentence, and up to
        // two buttons, never the icon-only mango this used to stop at.
