// TabsView — the config-driven tab strip. ENGINE-OWNED, KIT-DRAWN.
//
// The OLD library's TabsView took a `TabsConfig` (tabs as data, with icons,
// counts and visibility rules) and 21 call sites plus the screen engine feed
// it that way. The kit's own TabsView takes an `items` array instead, so this
// file keeps the old CONTRACT and renders it entirely through the kit's
// `Tabs` / `TabsList` / `TabsTrigger` / `TabsContent` — behaviour is the
// app's, every pixel is the kit's.
//
// THE FOLDER SHAPE IS GONE, v1.2.28. CLIENT RULING, 2026-09-02, verbatim:
// "the whole concept of folders as tabs gets killed. All the current folders
// as tabs we have will become line tabs. Completely kill and remove folder
// tabs… I don't want any dead body around… the only tabs that we will have
// are the line tabs because folders will only be used for the breadcrumbs."
// The kit's own `TabsVariant` is a one-member union now (`"line"`,
// `components/tabs/tabs.tsx`) — `folder` moved house to the breadcrumb
// silhouette (`components/breadcrumbs/breadcrumb-folders.tsx`) and did not
// come here with it, and the kit no longer accepts a `variant` prop on
// `TabsList`/`TabsTrigger` at all (there is nothing left to differ from the
// root). `TabsConfig.variant` follows suit below: one value, `"line"`, kept
// as a field for the same reason the kit still types a one-member union
// rather than dropping it — a call site that tries to write anything else
// fails to compile instead of drifting quietly, and `web/test/rules.test.ts`
// keeps a rot-check that nobody writes it explicitly at all any more, since
// there is exactly one value and one place it is decided.
//
// AND EVERY TAB NOW CARRIES AN ICON, THE SAME RULE THE LINE STRIP ALWAYS HAD.
// Client ruling, 2026-09-02, verbatim: "yes, they should have icons. They
// should be exactly like the line tabs. We will only have one variation of
// tabs with icons, exactly as they are already lined up." `tabIcon` below
// used to refuse an icon outright for a folder strip, on the owner's own
// ruling (kept in full beneath it, marked SUPERSEDED rather than deleted,
// same discipline shared/spine.ts uses for an overturned argument) — that
// branch is gone along with the shape it was drawn for: every tab resolves
// the one vocabulary now, the same path a line tab always used.
//
// Two further deliberate translations, both the kit's rulings rather than
// ours:
//  · `variant: "pill"` no longer exists (kit tabs were `line` | `folder`
//    before this; the review ruled pill was a segmented control wearing a
//    tab's name). A config asking for "pill" is refused the same way "folder"
//    now is — see `TabsConfig.variant` below.
//  · Counts and tags are QUIET TEXT, never badges — ch14: "counts are quiet,
//    never badges". The old `badgeVariant` colour is therefore not drawn.
//
// Icons: a TabItem carries an icon NAME as serialisable data, resolved against
// the kit and nothing else. It used to resolve against the kit FIRST and the
// full lucide set second, because the kit drew 96 glyphs and the app needed
// more; the kit draws 1,383 now, so the second half is deleted rather than
// left as a net. It was not a harmless net: when the art became Iconoir on
// 2026-08-27 that fallback silently kept thirty-seven names rendering LUCIDE,
// beside Iconoir art, on the same strip, with nothing going red. A name the
// kit cannot draw now renders nothing here and fails the census in
// web/test/icon-vocabulary.test.ts, which is the loud version of the same
// safety. (The original bug the fallback fixed — "info" and "user" drawing
// nothing on a tab while the heading beside it drew fine — stays fixed: both
// resolve through the one shared alias table in ./icon-names.)

 * (record-chrome.tsx) to the other half of the app: a main/collection
 * screen's tab strip used to keep scrolling away with the rest of the page,
 * the exact gap a detail screen's tabs had already been fixed for.
 *
 * AND THE STRIP IS NOW THE ONLY THING THAT PINS — client ruling, 2026-09-03,
 * verbatim: "when I scroll down, the whole compressed title is useless, so
 * remove that. When I scroll down, what is at the top should be only the
 * tabs, if there are tabs, on the same line as the whole eyebrow." The
 * condensed stand-in title that used to take this slot (`condensed-title.tsx`,
 * `CondensedTitleBar`) is deleted outright, and so is the eyebrow row it and
 * the full main-screen heading both drew. `top-0` rather than the
 * `--collection-tabs-top` clearance it read until now: that custom property
 * existed for ONE reason — to measure the condensed bar's real, wrapping
 * height and hold the strip clear of it — and with nothing above the strip
 * any more there is no clearance left to compute. A screen with NO tabs
 * pins nothing at all, which falls out of `renderFolderTabs` returning
 * `null`, not out of a second rule.
 *
 * IF SOMETHING EVER PINS ABOVE THIS STRIP AGAIN, it cannot hand the offset
 * down as a class: `SectionWithCreate`'s `folderTabs` slot and `PagedFind`'s
 * `tabs` sit several layers below a screen's heading and are a plain SIBLING
 * of it in every `*-screen.tsx` file, so the nearest shared ancestor is the
 * document root — which is why the deleted mechanism published to
 * `document.documentElement` (the same reason `shared/web/scale-section.tsx`
 * still does) and measured with a `ResizeObserver` rather than trusting a
 * token, since a translated word can change a bar's line count. That is the
 * part of the old bar's reasoning worth keeping; the bar itself is not.
 *
 * Unlike a record's own strip, this one is never nested inside a padded
 * card it has to escape — `SectionWithCreate`'s `folderTabs` slot and
 * `PagedFind`'s `tabs` both render it as a plain sibling, directly in the
 * page's own flow, ABOVE any card — so this needs none of `STICKY_TABS`'s
 * `-mx`/`px` cancel-and-restore arithmetic, only `position: sticky` and
 * `top: 0`.
 *
 * `pb-[var(--tab-content-gap)]` — THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TABS AND WHAT THEY
 * LABEL, client ruling, 2026-09-03, verbatim: "there needs to be space
 * between the tabs and the start of the container … make sure that you
 * don't hard-code page by page, but rather you change the rule and you
 * apply it everywhere," then, same session, scrolled: "make sure to
 * maintain the space between tabs and content on all screens, even when I
 * scroll down."
 *
 * THIS WAS `mb-[var(--tab-content-gap)]` — A MARGIN — AND A MARGIN BETWEEN
 * TWO SIBLINGS IS NEVER PAINTED. It reserves space in static layout, which is
 * why it looked right at rest, but the moment this strip pins
 * (`position: sticky`, right below), the content below keeps scrolling and
 * carries that reserved space away with it: the margin belongs to flow, the
 * strip does not, so past the first scroll tick the panel's own text scrolls
 * up flush against the tab strip's bottom edge with no gap at all — exactly
 * the failure the second ruling above names. The kit hit the identical bug on
 * its own sticky strip (`RecordDetail`, CHANGELOG v1.2.29 "the tab-to-content
 * gap, made one rule instead of three numbers") and fixed it the same way:
 * the gap is PADDING on the sticky element's OWN box, not a margin on
 * whatever comes after it. Padding is inside the box that is sticky and
 * painted (`bg-background` just below), so it is reserved and repainted at
 * every scroll position the strip is pinned at, never carried away by a
 * scrolling sibling. Still `--tab-content-gap` (declared once in
 * `web/app/globals.css`, the same property `--record-tab-gap` in
 * record-chrome.tsx resolves to, `design-scale.test.ts`'s own "one seam, both
 * strips read it" rot-check) — only the CSS property changed, margin to
 * padding, not the value or where it is declared.
 *
 * `[&>[role=tablist]]:self-start` — THE SAME FIX `STICKY_TABS` NEEDED —
 * `[role=tablist]` is a flex child of `<Tabs>` (`flex flex-col`, tabs.tsx, no
 * `items-start`), so with nothing of its own saying otherwise it stretches to
 * the full cross-axis width of whatever it sits in — a main screen with no
 * page-width cap at all (R29) and as few as two tabs (Apps' Active/Inactive),
 * which left a large, blank, unstyled rectangle immediately after the last
 * tab. `self-start` opts it back out of the column's default stretch, sizing
 * to its own tabs the same way `max-w-full` + `overflow-x-auto` already
 * assumed it did.
 *
 * `sticky`/`top`/`z-10`/`bg-background` LAND ON `<Tabs>` ITSELF, NOT ON
 * `[role=tablist]` — measured live, not guessed: `<Tabs>` here has exactly
 * one child (the tablist — this strip never hands `TabsView` a `renderPanel`,
 * "A COLLECTION'S OWN TAB STRIP, AND NOTHING ELSE," this file's own type doc
 * for `FolderTabStrip`), and is therefore exactly as tall as it is. A
 * `position: sticky` element's stuck RANGE is bounded by its own containing
 * block, which for a flex child is the flex container itself; `<Tabs>` being
 * no taller than the tablist it holds leaves that range at zero, so the
 * browser never has room to hold it in place, no matter how correct the
 * computed `top` is. `SectionWithCreate`'s and `PagedFind`'s own wrapping
 * `<div>` — the ACTUAL sibling of the tab strip and the collection rows
 * beneath it — is tall enough (it spans the whole scrollable section), and
 * `<Tabs>` is its direct child, so the sticky declaration lands one level up,
 * on `<Tabs>`, giving the browser that ancestor's real height to stick
 * within. */
/* THE STRIP PAINTS THE CARD'S OWN SURFACE, NOT THE PAGE GROUND — client
   screenshot, dark mode, 2026-09-03: "fix the toolbar in dark mode", a
   collection screen whose tab strip drew a near-black band across a card that
   is a full step lighter. This read `bg-background`, which was indistinguishable
   from `--surface-raised` in light (both `--kw-off-beige`) and is a genuinely
   different colour in dark since today's spine work split them
   (`--kw-unlit-page` #141310 vs `--kw-unlit-raised` #26241F). The strip sits
   ON the card, and its whole job while pinned is to occlude the rows scrolling
   under it — so it has to be the card's own surface or it reads as a hole
   punched in one. Third instance of this exact token confusion today (the
   assistant panel and the toolbar/collection containers were the first two);

/** CLIENT RULING, 1 Sep 2026 — three fixes to the LINE strip, app-side
 * overrides on the kit's `Tabs` (vendored, pinned, CLAUDE.md R39 — reached
 * through `[&_[data-slot=…]]:` the same pattern `web/components/shell/auth-card.tsx`
 * documents, never a kit hand-edit). Unconditional now that line is the only
 * strip this file ever draws (it applied only to the line strip already, so
 * v1.2.28's retirement of folder changes nothing about the rule itself).
 *
 * 1. THE UNDERLINE'S THICKNESS, SETTLED AT THREE STEPS. The kit draws the
 *    active tab's mark at `0.125rem` (2px) — both where it is drawn TWICE, the
 *    trigger's own inset shadow (`tabs.tsx` `TRIGGER_SELECTED.line`, painted
 *    before the strip has measured) and the travelling indicator once it has
 *    (`INDICATOR_SKIN.line`) — so both are forced together or the mark would
 *    visibly change thickness the instant the indicator mounts. The client
 *    first asked for "visibly heavier" with no exact figure; `0.1875rem`
 *    (3px), a 50% step, was rejected the same night as still not enough —
 *    "even thicker, like in the screenshot I gave you," pointing at a
 *    visibly bold, heavy underline. `0.3125rem` (5px) followed as the next
 *    real step (2.5x the kit's own 2px), and was itself called "too much" the
 *    same evening. The mark is now BACK at `0.1875rem` (3px) — the same value
 *    rejected the first time, kept this time because the third correction
 *    came with a second, independent change (below) rather than a fourth
 *    guess at the same knob.
 * 2. THE LABEL MATCHES THE MARK. The kit already draws both in `--foreground`
 *    (`TRIGGER_SELECTED.line`'s text, `TRIGGER_SELECTED_WITH_INDICATOR.line`'s
 *    text, and `INDICATOR_SKIN.line`'s fill all read the one token), so this
 *    line is a no-op today — pinned here anyway, forcing the label to the
 *    SAME token the mark is forced to two lines up, so the two can never drift
 *    apart again on a future kit pull the way the thickness above already has.
 * 3. THE UNDERLINE'S ENDS STAY SQUARE. Rounded ends (via `--radius-bar`, the
 *    kit's second radius exception — the indicator span carrying
 *    `rounded-[var(--radius-bar)]` directly, the trigger's own inset shadow
 *    reached indirectly by rounding the ACTIVE trigger's bottom corners so the
 *    shadow it casts curves with them) shipped and was reverted the same
 *    night: "very wrong, dont know what this upwards thing at the edges is.
 *    revert to straight line." Both draw paths are back at flat corners — the
 *    indicator carries no `rounded-*` class and the trigger's bottom corners
 *    are unrounded again, so the inset shadow is a hard-cornered bar, matching
 *    a resting tab. `--radius-bar` is unused again app-side; RADIUS_EXCEPTION
 *    in `shared/rules/registry.ts` never carried an entry for it (R31 admits
 *    any `rounded-[var(--radius…)]` bracket on the token alone), so there is
 *    nothing to clean up there.
 * All three are scoped to `data-state=active` only; a resting tab is untouched. */

/** CLIENT RULING, 1 Sep 2026 (screenshot + "this was on the pdf I fed you long
 * ago") — "apart from colour, also play with the weight of the fonts": on
 * the tab strip the active tab should read visibly HEAVIER than its
 * neighbours, not merely a different colour.
 *
 * It reads like a two-line fix and is really a one-line one, because the
 * "active is heavier" half was never missing. The kit's own vendored
 * `tabs.tsx` already forces the ACTIVE trigger to
 * `font-[var(--font-weight-medium)]` (500) (`TRIGGER_SELECTED.line`,
 * `TRIGGER_SELECTED_WITH_INDICATOR.line`) — that part shipped with the kit
 * and needs no override here.
 *
 * The missing half is the RESTING side. `TRIGGER_SKIN.line` sets no
 * font-weight at all, so a resting tab inherits the page's ordinary, unset
 * weight — which computes to the CSS default, `400`. And this system's Saans
 * face ships exactly two weights, 300 and 500 (tokens.css's own `@font-face`
 * block, and its comment: "the weight numbers are not assumptions, each
 * file's OS/2 usWeightClass was read off the binary"). `400` is not one of
 * them, and the CSS font-matching algorithm's own rule for a desired weight in
 * [400, 500] is to check weights ABOVE it first, up to and including 500 — so
 * an unset `400` request silently resolves to the SAME `500` (Medium) face the
 * active tab explicitly asks for. Both states were already painting the
 * identical Medium face; only the ink differed, exactly as reported. There is
 * nothing to un-pick on the active side, only a resting weight to actually
 * state (the kit never states one).
 *
 * Forced to `var(--font-weight-normal)` (300, this font's only lighter face)
 * so a resting tab visibly drops to Light rather than quietly riding along at
 * Medium — the same two named weights the kit's own active-tab rule already
 * reaches for, so the pairing is Light/Medium everywhere a tab strip renders,
 * never a third, invented step. App-side, not a kit edit, for the same R39

     has done since her 2026-09-02/09-03 rulings: `TRIGGER_SKIN` carries
     `enabled:hover:font-[var(--font-weight-medium)]`, weight as the only
     hover signal, colour untouched.

     It never reached these tabs. The resting rule above is `!important`,
     because it had to beat an unset weight that was silently resolving to
     the Medium face — and `!important` beats the kit's ordinary hover
     declaration too. So every strip drawn through this view had a hover
     state that could not fire, on every screen, while the kit's own demo
     showed it working. That is why she is asking for a thing that was
     already ruled twice.

     Restored rather than reimplemented: the same token the kit reaches for
     (`--font-weight-medium`), so the pairing stays the two named faces
     Light/Medium and no third step is invented. It wins on SPECIFICITY, not
     on order — `[data-slot][data-state]:hover` is three compound conditions
     against the resting rule's two, and both being `!important` the more
     specific one applies. `:hover` is a pointer signal only; the focus ring
     and the selected state remain the signals a touch or keyboard reader
     gets, exactly as the kit's own comment sets out. */

  // strip whose tabs are built from the team's own dropdown values, or (since
  // the nav memory landed) a tab remembered a few minutes ago on a record whose
  // tabs have changed underneath it. So the strip falls back to its FIRST tab
  // rather than to nothing — the same "degrade to the top" every other part of
  // that memory does.
  //
  // The caller is deliberately NOT told. `onValueChange` on the strip that
  // navigates (team-section-nav) MOVES you, and a screen the viewer may not read
  // must not be answered by yanking them somewhere else; every other strip in
  // the app reads this state for nothing but this prop, so a stale value costs
  // nothing while the tab it names is missing, and is correct again the moment

                // height plus a MINIMUM width plus padding, so it sizes to
