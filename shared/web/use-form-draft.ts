// Form-draft persistence (CACHING.md §11). The data cache keeps FETCHED data warm
// across navigation; this keeps UNSAVED form input from being lost. A half-filled
// form whose screen unmounts (you navigated elsewhere in the same tab) would
// otherwise reset to empty on return — the input lived only in component state.
//
// We persist each form's values to sessionStorage (survives navigation AND reload
// within the tab session; gone when the tab closes), keyed by a stable draft id the
// caller supplies (e.g. "brand:new:<teamId>" or "brand:edit:<recordId>").
//
// Lifetime: a draft is CLEARED on submit (the record now exists) and on an explicit
// dismiss (Esc / backdrop / the close button) — dismissing a form discards it. It is
// PRESERVED when the form simply unmounts from navigation — that's the case we're
// protecting. Also cleared for everyone on sign-out (clearAllFormDrafts).
//
// A LIVE PATCH WHILE THE FORM IS OPEN NEVER TOUCHES THE DRAFT. `initial` is read
// on the inactive→active edge and at no other time (see `initialRef` below), so
// when a colleague saves the same record two seconds before you and the row-level
// patch (`patchRow`, the R1/R15 seam) hands the host a new `initial`, your values
// stay yours, nothing prompts, and your save is what lands — whole-record, last
// save wins, in the order the saves happened. The owner's ruling, 2026-09-07: "I
// would just assume everything happens sequentially … I propagate the latest
// change, and that is what should be reflected." web/test/last-save-wins.test.tsx
// holds it through a real dialog over a real cached read, because an innocent
// `useEffect(() => setValues(initial), [initial])` in any one form would undo it
// silently and stay green.

/**
 * A saved draft, MERGED OVER the form's current shape — never in place of it.
 *
 * It used to return the stored object whole, and that is a silent bug generator:
 * the day a form gains a field, anybody holding a draft written before it gets
 * `undefined` for that field, with no error and nothing on screen to say so. It
 * cost a real feature — the step form grew a "Where it goes" picker, the picker
 * rendered its PLACEHOLDER (which is what a Select shows for an undefined
 * value), so it looked set and carried nothing, and the fork it exists to draw
 * silently did not happen.
 *
 * Merging fixes the class rather than the instance: a field the draft has wins,
 * a field it has never heard of keeps the shape's own value.
