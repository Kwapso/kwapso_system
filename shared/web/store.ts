"use client"

// A tiny cache-first data layer. It does two jobs that, together, make the app
// feel instant AND stay live:
//   • useCached(key, fetcher) returns the cached value IMMEDIATELY when we have
//     it (and refetches quietly in the background — "stale-while-revalidate"),
//     so screens after the first paint with no spinner.
//   • invalidate(key) drops an entry and tells anyone showing it to refetch —
//     this is what a live "X changed" ping calls, so data updates on its own.
// No dependency, ~one Map + a subscriber set. Reusable across every screen.

// ── THE CACHE IS BOUNDED, AND IT HAS A MAXIMUM AGE ───────────────────────────
// This was a plain `Map` that only ever grew. Nothing evicted, nothing expired,
// and nothing cleared it when the person or the team changed — so the power user
// CACHING.md is written for, one tab open for a working day, accumulated every
// list they had ever opened (up to LIST_HARD_CAP rows each) plus every page
// `loadMore` had ever appended, for as long as the tab lived. On a big tenant
// that is a browser that gets slower all morning and dies after lunch, and no
// screen was doing anything wrong to cause it.
//
// Three bounds, because there are three ways this fills up:
//   • KEYS    — how many collections are remembered at once,
//   • ROWS    — the number that actually costs memory (a key holding 5,000
//               appended rows is worth 100 holding fifty),
//   • AGE     — the ceiling on staleness that does not depend on a live ping
//               arriving. Realtime patches the rows it knows about; a screen
//               left open through a deploy, a permission change or a dropped
//               socket needs a floor under freshness that is ours, not the
//               socket's.
//
// EVICTION NEVER TAKES A KEY SOMEBODY IS LOOKING AT. A subscribed key is on
// screen, and dropping it would blank a list to make room for one nobody is
// reading. So the sweep skips subscribed keys and takes the least recently used
// of the rest — which is exactly right, because the unsubscribed ones are the
// ones the day's navigation left behind.
