// THE FIELD, IN THE READER'S LANGUAGE — one seam, every form, both front doors.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. A field's words are declared where the field is declared:
//
//   const nameField = { ...defaultFieldConfig, label: "Team name", required: true }
//
// …at MODULE scope, because a config is data and every form in this app writes it
// once beside the form rather than rebuilding it on each render. `t` is a hook
// (`useT`), so it cannot be called there — which is exactly why not one of the
// ~140 field labels in this app was ever wrapped, and why the library `Field`
// (which renders `config.label` verbatim, correctly: it renders what it is given)
// put every one of them on screen in English in all 28 other languages. The
// catalogue had them. The screens asked for none of them.
//
// SO THE TRANSLATION HAPPENS ON THE WAY TO THE SCREEN, not at the declaration.
// That is the same ruling `translateRecipe` makes for the screen recipes
// (web/lib/screens.ts) and for the same three reasons: the English stays where a
// developer typed it, because ENGLISH IS THE KEY (shared/i18n.ts) and that is
// what the extractor reads and what the catalogue is keyed by; the config stays
// data, so a test and a team override still read the English; and it is ONE
// function instead of a hundred and forty call sites, so the form somebody
// writes next month is translated the day it is written without anybody
// remembering to do anything.
//
// WHY A COMPONENT RATHER THAN A `translateFieldConfig(cfg, t)` HELPER. A helper
// would have to be CALLED, at every `<Field config={…}>` in the app, by somebody
// who remembered — which is the defect, restated. A wrapper moves the decision
// from "remember to translate" to "import Field", and importing Field is not
// something a person writing a form can forget to do. It is also why the props
// are the library's own, unchanged: a call site swaps ONE import line and does
// not otherwise move, so the adoption diff is reviewable by somebody who does
// not know this file exists.
//
// AND THE IMPORT IS THE ENFORCED PART. `web/test/wrapped-strings.test.ts` (R33)
// refuses a direct import of the library `Field` from either front door, so the
// seam cannot be walked around by accident — which is what makes it sound to
// treat a `label:` on a field config as already-translated rather than as an
// unwrapped string.
//
// NOT A FORK OF THE LIBRARY. It renders the library's `Field` and adds nothing
// to it: no styling, no layout, no behaviour. The library is right to render the
// words it is handed; deciding WHICH words is the host's job, and this is where
// the host does it. (UI-GAPS #25 records the one part that genuinely is the
// library's: `validateField` composes its own English error messages.)
