// MOVED FROM THE OLD LIBRARY when shared/ui became the vendored design kit
// (Kwapso/kwapso-ui-ux). This is a rich-text EDITOR — contentEditable, sanitised
// HTML in and out — which is BEHAVIOUR, so it lives app-side. The kit ships a
// component also called Notes (controls/notes), and it is a different thing: a
// read-only stack of remark rows. Same word, two components; this one keeps
// the editor's contract for the 14 form dialogs that write through it, and its
// toolbar toggles are the kit's own Toggle, so it draws in the new system.
"use client"

// Notes — a lightweight notes / rich-text editor with a small toolbar:
// bold, italic, highlight, bullet list, numbered list, and a separator. Emits
// HTML via onChange. Good for notes & descriptions; swap in a full editor
// (e.g. Tiptap) later if you need more. Highlight wraps the selection in a
// <mark> styled from tokens, so it re-themes with everything else.
// The seeded `defaultValue` is SANITIZED before it's placed in the editor
// (allow-list of formatting tags, every attribute stripped) so stored content
// can never smuggle in executable HTML — see ./logic.
//
// ── THE TOOLBAR SHOWS/HIDES, 2026-08-31 ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Client-reported: "on the rich text component, can we show/hide the
// toolbar? or, inside the text composer, add a button to show/hide it?
// takes too much space!" This editor sits on the Scope field of the App
// form and on description fields across several other forms — one more
// 40px-tall row of six controls above every one of them, on screens where
// FormShell's own action bar is already fighting for vertical room (see the
// three-row-grid note in shared/web/form-shell.tsx).
//
// Two ways to answer "takes too much space": remove the toolbar, or make it
// optional. Removing it would take away real capability — bold, lists,
// highlight — from every one of the 14 forms that write through this editor,
// to fix a problem that is only ever felt while the toolbar is open. A
// collapse toggle keeps the capability and gives back the space the rest of
// the time, which is the better default of the two, so that is what this
// builds: a small chevron button that shows/hides the row of Toggles below
// it, COLLAPSED by default — the complaint was about space, so the state a
// person lands on should be the one that saves it.
//
// PER-MOUNT STATE, not persisted. There is no existing per-viewer preference
// store this component could reach into: `web/lib/nav-memory.ts` is
// app-side, keyed to `web/`'s own page registry, and this file lives in
// `shared/web/` for both front doors. Building a second, generic
// localStorage-backed preference seam to remember one boolean is more
// plumbing than a single toggle earns — "too much code is a defect" — so
// this resets to collapsed on every mount, the same as every other piece of
// this editor's UI state today.
//
// ── THE TOGGLE MOVES INSIDE THE BOX, 2026-08-31 ──────────────────────────────
//
// Client-reported, on the same screenshot the sheet/field fixes came off of:
// "put it in the top left corner of the text box, using a representative
// icon — also the formatting options should be like a toolbar at top but
// visually inside of the text composer." Three complaints in one, all about
// the SAME seam not reading as one control: the toggle sat on its OWN LINE
// above the box, named itself with the word "Formatting" beside a bare
// chevron, and the row of Toggles it revealed floated in the gap between
// that line and the box's own top border — a second free-standing element,
// not part of the composer it edits.
//
// So the border moves UP a level, off the contentEditable `div` and onto the
// wrapper that already holds both pieces — the shape `input.tsx`'s own note
// calls "the field hairline", now drawn around toolbar-plus-text as one box
// instead of around the text alone. The strip inside it is ALWAYS there
// (never a separate line above the border), holding one icon-only `Toggle` —
// `TextAa`, the kit's own "Aa" glyph, the one entry in its 1,383 icons that
// says "text formatting" rather than "Bold" or "Italic" specifically, which
// is why it replaces the word "Formatting" AND the bare chevron the client
// named as the two things to drop. `pressed={showToolbar}` on the SAME
// `Toggle` component the format row already uses IS the disclosure's open/
// shut state — an inverse fill when the row is showing, needing no second
// chevron glyph to say so. Expanding grows the strip to hold the format row
// alongside it, still the one docked band `--hairline-under` (never a
// `border`) separates from the text below — "a thin toolbar strip inside the
// same bordered box", read back verbatim.

// ── THE LABEL ABOVE IT WAS POINTING AT NOTHING, 2026-09-07 ───────────────────
//
// Every one of the 16 places this editor is used sits inside a `Field`, and
// every one of those `Field`s was already passing an `htmlFor`. It reached the
// kit's `Label` as a `for="…"` attribute and then stopped: `<label for>` binds
// to a LABELABLE element — input, textarea, select, button, meter, output,
// progress — and this control's editable node is a `div`. So a sighted person
// read "About" above the box and a screen-reader user arrived at an edit box
// with no name at all. Sixteen times, on both front doors, since the day the
// editor was written. The gap list records that there is no app-side
// workaround, and it is right: wrapping this in another `<div id>` changes
// nothing, because the failure is in what a `for` attribute is allowed to
// point at, not in whether an id exists.
//
// So the name arrives the only way it can on a `div`, and all three halves are
// needed together:
//
//   · `role="textbox"` + `aria-multiline="true"` — a bare contentEditable has
//     no role a screen reader can trust across browsers, and without the
//     multiline flag the ones that do recognise it announce a single-line
//     field, so Enter is reported as "submits" rather than "new paragraph".
//   · `aria-label` / `aria-labelledby` — the accessible NAME. ARIA is what a
//     `div` has instead of a `<label>`, and it is why every call site now hands
//     over the words its `Field` is already showing (`t(aboutField.label)`)
//     rather than inventing a second sentence that could drift from the one on
//     screen. Where the words are a heading rather than a field label
//     (meeting-detail's Notes section) it is `aria-labelledby` at that heading,
//     which is the same binding pointed the other way.
//   · `id` — so the `htmlFor` the call sites were ALREADY writing lands on the
//     real editable node. It is what makes `aria-describedby` (the field's help
//     and error line, which the kit `Field` clones down here) resolve, and it
//     is the difference between a decorative prop and a wired one.
//
// AND `disabled`, asked for in the same breath by the same list, for a reason
// that is not about screen readers at all: every OTHER control on these forms
// takes `disabled={busy}`, so while a save is in flight the title, the dates
// and the pickers all go quiet and the notes body alone stayed editable. Typing
// into it during those few hundred milliseconds edited a value that had already
// been posted — the keystrokes land in React state that the in-flight request
// will never carry, and the dialog closes on success, so they are simply lost
// with no error and nothing to recover. `contentEditable={!disabled}` is what
// actually stops the typing (a `disabled` attribute means nothing on a `div`);
// `aria-disabled` is what says so out loud; and the toolbar's own Toggles go
// down with it, because a Bold button that still fires while the field cannot
// be edited is a control lying about its own state.
