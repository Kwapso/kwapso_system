// HOW BIG THE APP IS — three cards, shown not described, and one number
// behind them.
//
// PICTURE CARDS, NOT BUTTONS. This section drew a plain row of buttons for a
// while, on the reasoning that a root font size has no picture worth
// drawing — but the client asked for the same visual treatment `SpineSection`
// already gives Sidebar, which overrides that reasoning outright. The cards
// below are `SpineSection`'s own shape: `AppearanceOptionGroup` +
// `compositions/screens/settings.tsx`'s own `ScalePicture`, a sibling of
// `SpinePicture` drawn for exactly this and never wired up outside the kit's
// own demo until now. This is a RENDER-ONLY change — see below, every piece
// of `chosen`/`saving`/`choose()` is untouched.
//
// OPTIMISTIC, THEN PERSISTED, exactly as the language switcher is. A card
// presses, the size resizes instantly and the save follows; if the save
// fails the size snaps back and says so. The preference lives on the
// person's own row, so it follows them between devices rather than living
// in one browser (UI-RULEBOOK S4), and it is the ONLY way to make this app
// bigger, because the viewport is locked against pinch-zoom (S5).
//
// It sets one CSS variable and nothing else. Every size token in the theme is in
// `rem` and every spacing class is a Tailwind `rem` step, so text and spacing
// move together from one number — which is what the owner asked for, and what
// the iPhone's own setting does.

     "Regular"; this app's own middle step has always been stored as
