// LIGHT, DARK OR THE MACHINE'S OWN — three cards, shown not described, the
// same visual treatment `SpineSection` and `ScaleSection` give their own
// choices. This REPLACES `AppearanceSection`'s plain `<ModeToggle />` on the
// Settings page only — the profile menu keeps the plain segmented control,
// because that context wants the compact toggle, not a three-card grid.
//
// THE CARDS ARE THE KIT'S OWN. `AppearanceOptionGroup` and `ThemePicture` are
// `compositions/screens/settings.tsx`'s own sub-primitives, lifted standalone
// exactly as `SpineSection` lifts `AppearanceOptionGroup` and `SpinePicture`
// — see that file's own header for the fuller reasoning.
//
// DEVICE-LOCAL, NOT ON THE PERSON'S ROW. `AppearanceSection`'s own header
// said it plainly: "It is remembered on this device." So unlike
// `SpineSection` and `ScaleSection` there is no `value`/`save` pair here —
// this component owns its own state, seeded from `localStorage` and applied
// straight to the document, using exactly the mechanism `ModeToggle` itself
// documents as its public contract: the `data-theme` attribute on
// `document.documentElement`, values `"light"` / `"dark"` (system removes
// the attribute entirely), `documentElement.style.colorScheme` set
// alongside it, and the `"theme"` `localStorage` key. Applying that
// mechanism directly here — rather than steering a hidden `<ModeToggle
// mode={...} />` through its controlled props — does not fork it: the file's
// own comments state these exact tokens as the contract `tokens.css` §6/§7
// depend on, so anything that keeps to them is a legal second writer, not a
// second mechanism.
//
// SSR-GUARDED THE SAME WAY `ModeToggle` GUARDS ITSELF. Its own
// `getServerSnapshot` answers "system" for the server render and the
// hydrating first paint, and only reads storage afterwards. This component
// does the same: `chosen` starts at `"system"`, and the real stored value is
// read in a `useEffect` — after mount, never during render — so there is
// nothing for React to flag as a hydration mismatch.
