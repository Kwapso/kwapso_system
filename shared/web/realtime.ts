"use client"

// The live channel client. A browser opens up to TWO sockets to the realtime
// switchboard, each calling `onEvent` for every "X changed" ping:
//   • the active TEAM's channel  (useRealtime(teamId)) — team data
//   • your OWN user channel       (useUserRealtime(userId)) — identity data +
//     a forced sign-out, open even before you join a team
// Reconnects with backoff; closes on unmount or when the id changes. The cookie
// rides the handshake, so the server gates it the same way the API does. Pass a
// null id to stay disconnected. `onReconnect` fires after a DROPPED link is
// re-established (not the first connect) so the host can resync what it missed.

/** WHEN THE CURRENT UNBROKEN TEAM CONNECTION BEGAN — the one fact that lets the
 * cache stop re-asking for things it is already being told about.
 *
 * The whole caching model is "read once, then let the socket keep it fresh"
 * (CACHING.md), and the socket does exactly that. But `useCached` revalidated on
 * EVERY mount regardless, so moving between two screens re-fetched collections
 * the live layer had been guarding the entire time — the reason a screen the app
 * already had in memory still waited on the network. The owner's question was
 * the right one: if the durable object tells us about every change, why ask
 * again?
 *
 * The honest answer is "you may skip it, but only for as long as you have not
 * missed a ping." So the promise is deliberately narrow and time-bounded:
 *
 *   • It is set at OPEN and re-set at every RE-open. A reconnect means there was
 *     a gap, and a ping raised during that gap reached nobody — so everything
 *     cached BEFORE the reconnect is suspect again, and only what was written
 *     after it is covered.
 *   • It is cleared on close and on unmount, so a disconnected tab revalidates
 *     normally, as it did before any of this.
 *   • It says nothing about WHICH resources are covered. A socket carries a
 *     `sub=` list and only hears what it names, so the store pairs this with a
 *     host-registered predicate (`registerLiveCoverage` in store.ts) that knows
 *     which cache keys the listener registry actually moves. Time alone is not
 *     enough; a key nothing listens for must still be re-read.
 *
 * MAX_CACHE_AGE_MS still applies on top of all of it, so nothing is painted
 * indefinitely on the strength of a socket that believes it is well. */

/** THE SAME FACT, FOR A PERSON RATHER THAN FOR THE CACHE.
 *
 * `teamConnectedAt` has always known whether this tab is being told about
 * changes. Until now the only thing that ever asked was `store.ts`, deciding
 * whether it could paint from cache — so the app knew it had gone deaf and
 * never said so. A screen that has quietly stopped updating looks exactly like
 * a screen where nothing is happening, which is the live layer's worst failure
 * shape and the one nobody reports as a bug.
 *
 * So the fact becomes subscribable, the same way `running-jobs` publishes
 * whether an act is in flight: one module-level value, one listener set, and a
 * `useSyncExternalStore` hook so the FIRST render already knows rather than
 * flashing the wrong state through an effect.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: distinguish "connecting for the first
 * time" from "dropped, retrying". Both mean the same thing to the person
 * reading the screen — you are not being told about changes right now — and a
 * three-state indicator that says "connecting" for the 200 ms of a healthy
 * page load would be a flicker on every navigation, reporting a problem that
 * is not one. The cache makes the same simplification for the same reason.
 *
 * The USER channel is not in it: it carries identity events and knows nothing
 * about a collection, so its uptime cannot vouch for what is on screen — the
 * same line `teamConnectedAt` itself draws two dozen lines up. */
