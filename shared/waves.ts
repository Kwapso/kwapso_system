// A WAVE — what a client BOUGHT: a package of sprints.
//
// The owner's own example is the whole definition: "Alex sells Hogo a package —
// he maps their processes, builds two automations, they test it, he trains them.
// Three weeks later he sells a second, identical package." That is TWO waves,
// and they are told apart by their NAME and their DATES, never by a kind.
//
// THREE RULINGS ARE BUILT INTO THIS SHAPE, and each of them is a decision that
// was made once and must not be re-made by whoever writes the next screen:
//
//   • THERE IS NO PRICE ON A WAVE, and nothing here reaches the internal rate
//     card or the account rate card. The owner ruled the money out of the first
//     version four separate times — "leave the whole internal_rates and
//     account_rates out of V1… This is a fix decision" — which is why the `waves`
//     table has no price column for a field here to mirror. R24 forbids an
//     internal number reaching the client's side at all, so the safe shape is
//     the one that cannot carry one.
//
//   • THE DATES ARE DERIVED FROM THE SPRINTS AND STORED. `startsOn` is the
//     earliest start of the live sprints in the wave and `endsOn` the latest
//     end, recalculated whenever a sprint is added, moved or removed — never
//     computed per row on a read, because a list of waves would then be a
//     sub-query per row for a number that changes a handful of times a year.
//
//   • BOTH DATES ARE NULLABLE, and that is a real state rather than a gap: a
//     wave is sold before anybody plans the sprints inside it, so a wave with no
//     sprints has no dates and is perfectly ordinary.
//
// The shapes live here rather than beside the SQL for the same reason every
// other record's do: the workers produce them and both front doors read them, so
// one master copy is the only way the two halves cannot drift.
