// WHERE A DROPDOWN VALUE ACTUALLY LIVES — the map that makes a rename a rename.
//
// THE FAULT THIS EXISTS TO CLOSE. A record stores its dropdown value as the WORD:
// `help.help_type` holds the string `'Request'` on 107 tickets. `selectable_data`
// holds the same word once, with the emoji beside it. Nothing joins them but the
// spelling.
//
// So HALF of "change it once, change it everywhere" already worked and half was
// broken, and the halves are easy to mistake for each other:
//
//   • the MARK is a real lookup. It exists only on the dropdown row and is read
//     by the word, so changing an emoji already reached every record instantly.
//   • the WORD is the JOIN KEY. Renaming it moved the dropdown row and left every
//     record behind — 107 tickets still saying "Request" while the vocabulary had
//     moved on to "Ask", their tab gone, their mark gone, and a new tab reading
//     "Ask 0" beside them.
//
// The alternative was to store the dropdown row's ID on every record and look the
// word up. That is the tidier data model and it is not worth what it costs here:
// the word is what the door filters by, what the CSV export carries, what the
// importer matches, and what four MCP tools take as an argument (R19/R22/R27 all
// name `helpType` as a WORD). Every one of those contracts would move to buy a
// user-visible result this map already buys.
//
// WHAT EACH GROUP IS. Three answers, and every group must give one — the check
// beside this file reads the seed and fails on a group that names none, so a new
// vocabulary cannot be added without saying where its words are kept:
//
//   • a `columns` entry — a real vocabulary. The words are stored on records, so
//     a rename REWRITES them, in the same script that renames the row.
//   • `"labels"` — the CODE owns the states (a ticket runs new → resolved as an
//     enum the server validates). The dropdown row supplies only the display word
//     and the mark, which is already a lookup, so a rename reaches every screen
//     with nothing to rewrite.
//   • `"unused"` — the group backs nothing at all. Five of the seventeen do: they
//     are legacy Glide vocabularies whose module never came, plus one retired by
//     a migration. They are recorded rather than deleted so the next person to
//     find them knows they were looked at, and so the check can tell "nothing
//     stores this" from "nobody has written the entry yet".

  // ticket arrives as one kind and is recategorised into another. Nothing may
  // UPDATE it — that is the whole of its value — and this rewrite is not an
  // exception to that, it is the same rule read carefully.
  //
  // A rename changes a value's SPELLING, never a ticket's identity. Carry only
  // `help_type` and renaming "Request" to "Ask" would leave every historical
  // request claiming it arrived as a "Request" and is now an "Ask" — a
  // recategorisation nobody performed, manufactured by an edit on the Dropdown
  // values screen, and the exact number the chart exists to report. It would
  // also leave the column holding a word the vocabulary no longer contains, so
  // the row would have no mark and no tab, which is the original fault at the
