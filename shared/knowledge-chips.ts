// WHICH DOORS ONE CONVERSATION USES — the source chips, as data.
//
// THE OWNER'S ASK, 1 Sep 2026: five or six chips above the assistant's input,
// all ON by default, untick to narrow. Control when he wants it, and a
// diagnostic when an answer smells wrong — re-ask with one chip on and see which
// door lied.
//
// AND THE HONEST LIMIT, said here because it belongs beside the feature rather
// than in a message nobody keeps: THE CHIPS ARE A STEERING WHEEL, NOT CURATION.
// They narrow WHICH DOORS a conversation reads from. They cannot stop a junk
// source outranking a real one inside a ticked door — that is what the fold
// (`knowledge-google.ts`'s FOLD_TO_THE_APP_S_OWN_RECORD) is for. Both matter and
// they are different layers.
//
// ── THE SECOND HALF, BUILT 4 SEP 2026 ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE OWNER'S ASK WAS TWO THINGS AND ONLY ONE WAS BUILT: "choose which data
// sources it should use OR WHICH TOOLS IT SHOULD CALL". A chip narrowed the
// CORPUS — the indexed copy of a folder or a mailbox, read through
// `ask_knowledge` — and narrowed nothing else. So the owner unticked Gmail,
// asked for the latest message in his primary inbox, and the assistant searched
// his live mail through `google_mail_search` and answered from it. The control
// said one thing and the app did another, which is the one failure a control
// cannot survive: a person who unticks Mail and reads an answer out of their
// mail is right to stop trusting every other switch in the product too.
//
// SO A CHIP ALSO NAMES THE LIVE GOOGLE SERVICES IT SPEAKS FOR, and a service
// whose chip is unticked is REFUSED AT THE DOOR for that turn — not merely left
// out of the prompt. Left out is a hope about what a model does with a
// catalogue; refused is a fact it cannot talk its way past, and it also says WHY
// in words the assistant can repeat ("Gmail is unticked for this
// conversation"), which "the tool was never offered" cannot.
//
// THE WRITE TOOLS FOLLOW THE SAME CHIP. Decided here rather than left to the
// reader: somebody who unticks Gmail does not expect mail SENT on their behalf
// in that conversation, and "it only stopped me READING your mail" is not a
// sentence anybody would accept afterwards. The chip is the only control in
// front of the input box, so it means the service, not the verb. The cost of
// being wrong in this direction is one tick to put it back; the cost in the
// other direction is a message in somebody else's inbox.
//
// AND `query_records` IS STILL NOT NARROWED — see `injectSources` in
// workers/data-ops/src/lib/agent.ts. That is a question about the app's live
// rows with its own permission at its own door, and silently shrinking it would
// make a COUNT WRONG rather than a search narrower. The Google doors are the
// opposite case: they read material a person believes they have just switched
// off.
//
// ONE DEFINITION, TWO SIDES. The screen draws these, the retrieval door narrows
// by them, and the machine surfaces expose the same word — so the grouping lives
// here, in `shared/`, and not in any of the three. The kinds are STRINGS rather
// than an import of `KNOWLEDGE_KINDS`: that list belongs to the content worker
// and `shared/` may not depend on a worker. The two are held together by a check
// instead (`workers/content/test/knowledge-coverage.test.ts`), which asserts
// every kind the sweep writes sits in EXACTLY ONE chip — so a kind added
// tomorrow cannot be silently unreachable from the screen, and cannot be
// reachable from two chips that disagree.
//
// NO LABELS HERE. A chip's words are the caller's, translated at the point they
// are drawn (R28/R33) — a sentence in `shared/` that no front door said would be
// an orphan in the catalogue.

/** One chip: the key that travels on the wire, the KINDS of indexed material it
 * covers, and the LIVE GOOGLE SERVICES it speaks for.
 *
 * Two lists because there are two halves to one idea. `kinds` is the corpus —
 * the sweep's own copy, searched through `ask_knowledge`. `services` is the live
 * door — somebody's actual mailbox, Drive, Chat or calendar, read this second
 * through the Google tools. A person who unticks "Gmail" means both, and before
 * 4 Sep 2026 it meant only the first.
 *
 * `services` are STRINGS for the same reason `kinds` are: this file may not
 * import a worker's list, and the two are held together by a check instead
 * (`workers/data-ops/test/source-chip-gate.test.ts`), which asserts the chips
 * name EXACTLY the four services `GOOGLE_SERVICES` declares — so a fifth service
 * cannot arrive ungated. */
