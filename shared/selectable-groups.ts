// THE DROPDOWN GROUPS THE CODE ITSELF NAMES.
//
// Most groups in `selectable_data` are a team's own business — they type them on
// the Dropdown values screen and nothing in the code knows they exist. These four
// are different: a worker pick-or-creates into them (the way a meeting purpose's
// department is pick-or-created into "Department"), or the legacy migration lands
// a set of rows in them. So the string has to be said in ONE place, or the
// screen that offers a value and the door that writes one drift into two groups
// with the same meaning and different names — which is the exact failure the
// module exists to prevent, committed by the module itself.
//
// A group is not a row: the table holds (type, value) pairs, so a group EXISTS
// once it has a value. That is why the two migrated ones ship with a starting
// vocabulary (DEFAULT_SELECTABLE in workers/tenancy/src/team-schema.ts) and the
// two module vocabularies do not — those fill themselves from the first value
// anybody writes, or from the rows the legacy import brings.
