// THE FIVE DEPARTMENTS a piece of our own admin belongs to — and the ONE thing
// each of them changes about the form.
//
// They are not an enum. The five names are seeded as ordinary values in the
// `Department` dropdown group (SELECTABLE_GROUPS.department, the same group a
// meeting purpose already pick-or-creates into), so a team adds or retires one on
// the Dropdown values screen without a deploy — the owner's answer to c1. What
// lives HERE is the part a dropdown row cannot carry: the mark and the colour the
// agency already chose for each of the five in the app they are leaving, and the
// SECOND QUESTION each one asks.
//
// The names and marks are read off the legacy data (glide/data/
// agency.departments.json, the `departments` table) rather than invented: Sales
// paper-airplane, Admin folder, Production code-bracket, Marketing star,
// Business rocket-launch. The legacy set had eight rows; three of them (System,
// Operations, Support) carried no colour and no icon, which is what "the five"
// means.
//
// THE COLOURS ARE THE CHART SERIES, NOT THE LEGACY HEXES. Each of the five
// arrived carrying a hex the old app had chosen (#F4C600, #6738E8, #B1E847,
// #f584e3, #C497FE) and none of the five was one of kwapso's own colours, so a
// department dot was the one mark on screen that did not belong to this app's
// palette — and five literals in a shared file is exactly the shape UI-RULEBOOK
// C10 refuses, because a theme change cannot reach them. A department is a MARK,
// and C6 says a mark comes from the chart series, so the five now resolve
// through `--chart-1` to `--chart-5`: the same five colours the pulse charts and
// every other categorical mark in the app already draw from. The order is the
// legacy order, so a department keeps the same dot from one release to the next.
//
// A department a team invents itself is a first-class value with no mark and no
// second question — `departmentMark` answers null and `departmentAsks` answers
// "nothing else", which is the honest reading of a word the code has never met.
