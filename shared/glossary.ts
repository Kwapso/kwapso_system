  // THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO `user` ENTRY, AND ADDING ONE WOULD BREAK THE BUILD.
  // A user is an IDENTITY (one row in the global `users` table); a Member is that
  // identity on a team. The first is engineering vocabulary the screens must never
  // say — R34 bans "user"/"users" in favour of "member" (GLOSSARY_SYNONYMS), and a
  // glossary term may not be a banned word, so this omission is enforced rather
  // than merely intended. DATA-MODEL.md § `users` states the three-way distinction
  // (user / member / person) in full; this comment exists so the next reader does
  // not "fix" the gap.
  //
  // DELETE THIS COMMENT WHEN: the two front doors legitimately say "user" to a
  // person — which today they do zero times out of 1,955 catalogued sentences,
  // and R34 is what keeps it that way. If that ban is ever lifted, this note is
  // wrong and the entry it forbids may be the right thing to add.
  //
  // NOTE ON `person`: it is NOT a banned word and must not become one. It is the
  // word inside this very definition, and it is the right word for the people who
  // are not members — the contact who raised a ticket, the name on an account.

  // ONE VERB FOR SWITCHING A RECORD OFF (R6, decided 2026-08-19). The word
  // "retired" used to sit inside this definition, and three screens had taken it
  // out again as a button of its own — a rate card and a staff profile both said
  // Retire / Restore for the very thing this entry names, and staff-panel.tsx
  // put Retire and Archive on one screen for two records that behave alike. Both
  // doors write an `active` flag and both rows stay on screen greyed, which is
  // this word, not Archive's. So the word is gone from the definition too: a
  // term the app is not allowed to say should not survive as prose here.

  // THE WORD THE SCREENS NOW SAY TOO (her ruling, 2026-09-09): "the filter
  // client is the company, so it's the account. Rename client to account
  // everywhere we said client. This was a mistake." The dictionary was already
  // right — the column is `account_id`, the type is `Account`, the door is
  // /api/tenancy/accounts — and the INTERFACE was the half saying Client for
  // this same record. So the facets, the columns, the pickers and the
  // possessives moved onto this word; nothing about the data model did.
  //
  // WHAT DID NOT MOVE, and must not be "finished" later: "client" is still the
  // right word for the RELATIONSHIP and for the PERSON in it — a portal login
  // who raises a ticket, replies, is emailed, or may never read the agency's
  // own notes. R34's registry note refuses to ban the word for exactly that

  // THE FLAG NEVER PRE-SELECTED ANYTHING. `selectable_data.is_default` has
  // exactly one behavioural read in the whole app — `setSelectableActive`
  // (workers/tenancy/src/lib/selectable.ts) refuses to switch the row off while
  // it is set. No picker, no dialog and no resolver has ever read it to choose
  // a value for somebody, so "Default" promised a behaviour the app does not
  // have, on 100% of the shipped vocabulary: every seeded row and every
  // migration back-fill writes 1, and only the two create doors write 0.
  //
  // WHY NOT "BUILT-IN", which was the first suggestion. It says where the row
  // CAME FROM, and that is only true today — "Protect it" is offered on every
  // value a person can edit, so the first team to protect a word of their own
  // would be reading a badge that lies about their own row. The word has to
  // name what the flag DOES, because that is the half that is always true.
  // "Locked" over-claims for the same kind of reason: a protected value can
  // still be renamed, and the protection comes off in one click.
  //
  // THE COLUMN AND THE API FIELD KEEP THEIR NAME. `is_default` / `isDefault`
  // are a migration and a door change for zero benefit, and the same ruling
  // CLAUDE.md records for `help`/Tickets applies: the human-facing word moves,

  // WHAT THE ASSISTANT COSTS, IN ONE WORD (R6, decided 2026-08-19). The app said
  // "assistant requests" and "assistant allowance" two lines apart in the same
  // paragraph, "assistant credits" in the header badge, and "AI quota" in the
  // prompt handed to an outside tool — four names for one number, and no entry
  // for any of them. Underneath there are genuinely TWO POTS (a free daily count
  // in `agent_usage`, a balance an admin tops up in `agent_credits`), but they
  // hold the SAME unit, and `AgentQuota.remaining` already adds them together to
  // answer the only question a person asks: can I ask it something? So the UNIT
  // gets the word, and the two pots are said as plain adjectives on that one word
  // ("free credits left today", "an admin can add more") rather than earning a
  // second term somebody has to keep apart. The usage view is the one screen that
  // splits them, because that is the screen whose whole job is the split.

  compartment: { term: "Compartment", def: "The slice of the knowledge base a question is answered from, one account's world, or the agency's own." },
  citation: { term: "Citation", def: "The source an answer came from. Every answer names its own; an answer with no source isn't one." },

  // ONE WORD FOR WHAT SORT OF THING A RECORD IS (R6, decided 2026-08-19). A
  // ticket said Type, a sprint and a story said Kind, a deliverable said Kind
  // and a brand asset said Category — four words for one field, on screens a
  // person walks between in a morning. The dropdown groups behind three of the
  // four were already seeded "Ticket type" / "Sprint type" / "Story type", so
  // the app's own data had settled this before its copy did. The word is Type.
  //
  // WHAT DID NOT CHANGE, and why: the GROUP STRINGS ("Sprint type", "Deliverable
  // kind", "Brand asset category") are values in `selectable_data.type` in every
  // team database, and renaming one orphans its rows from the values filed under
  // it. Same ruling as CLAUDE.md's `help`/Tickets: the human-facing word moves,
  // the identifier stays. ("Kind of work" was kept for the same reason — a rate
  // was priced per CATEGORY OF LABOUR, a different thing from a record's type —
  // and the phrase left the app with the rate card on 10 Sep 2026.)

  // PROCESS MAPS, VERSIONS AND THE MONEY (SCOPE ch.02 — ported, never invented).
  // The chain is App → Process → Step, and it is what every savings figure is
  // drilled through. `app` is the one word this build shares with the work-engine
  // lane (.plans/BUILD-1 §9 ports it too); the definition below is that lane's,
  // word for word, so a merge keeps one line rather than choosing between two.
  process: { term: "Process", def: "A way of working inside an app, the steps someone takes to get one job done." },
  // A MODULE IS THE APP'S OWN DIVISION, AND IT IS NOT A PROCESS. The two sit on
  // different trees and the difference is the whole reason both exist: an
  // ACCOUNT has processes (how the client's business works, versioned, the thing
  // every saving is drilled through), while an APP has modules (how the software
  // we built is divided — Settings, Documents, Tasks). A ticket is filed against
  // a module because a ticket is about a screen; a saving is measured on a
  // process because a saving is about a job of work.
  //
  // THE WORD WAS FREE, which is why we could take the one the team already says.
  // `module` has meant "a permission module" in this codebase since the base was
  // built — but only ever in CODE. It appeared zero times in the app's
  // user-visible sentences (the Roles screen settled on "access right" on 19 Aug
  // 2026), so no screen has to change and no reader meets the word twice.

  step: { term: "Step", def: "One part of a process. It carries how long it takes and how often it runs." },
  processVersion: { term: "Version", def: "A process as it was at one moment. Version 1 is how they worked before us; each later one is what we changed it to." },
  baseline: { term: "Baseline", def: "Version 1 of a process, how the work was done before we touched anything. Every saving is measured from it." },
  savings: { term: "Saving", def: "Time a step no longer takes: the baseline minus the latest version, times how often it runs." },
  regression: { term: "Regression", def: "A step that now takes longer than the baseline. We show it, and we say why." },
  agreedEstimate: { term: "Agreed estimate", def: "A time we agreed with you rather than measured. The estimates are agreed; the subtraction is arithmetic." },
  // THE HEADLINE NUMBER OF THE WHOLE PRODUCT, and until 19 Aug 2026 it had no
  // entry — a tab on two screens, a section of the client portal and two machine
  // tools, all naming a concept the dictionary had never defined. It is the same
  // arithmetic `saving` describes, summed and shown: a saving is one step getting
  // faster, impact is what all of them come to.
  impact: { term: "Impact", def: "What the work has given back, summed: the hours a client no longer spends, and what those hours are worth." },
  // THREE MONEY WORDS STOOD HERE and all three left on 10 Sep 2026, in two
  // rulings an hour apart. INTERNAL RATE ("what an hour of our own work costs
  // us") and MARGIN ("what is left of revenue after our own time and tool
  // costs") went with the internal-rates feature; RATE CARD ("what an account is
  // charged per hour, by kind of work") went with the client's second ruling,
  // "the whole account rates also killed it". A glossary entry for a concept no
  // screen says any more is a dictionary of a product that used to exist.
  //
  // THE MONEY WORDS THAT SURVIVE are below and beside: `impact` (what the work
  // gave back, and what those hours are worth), `toolCost` (what an app costs US
  // to run) and `priceVisibility` (the switch). None of them is a card.

  priceVisibility: { term: "Price visibility", def: "The switch on an account that decides whether they see what they bought. Impact is shown either way." },
  // WHAT WE HAND OVER on an app. ONE word now, not two: the KIND entry that used
  // to sit here was the very fault it was written to prevent — it worried that
  // "somebody writes 'category' on one screen and 'type' on the next", and by
  // then a brand asset already said Category and a ticket already said Type. So
  // the concept moved up to `recordType`, and the deliverable keeps its own noun.
  deliverable: { term: "Deliverable", def: "Something we handed over on an app: a handover doc, an API reference, a recorded walkthrough, an SOP." },
  // A GLOSSARY DECISION, MADE ON PURPOSE (Law R6). "The client can see this one"
  // had no word, and the two obvious coinages — "published", "shared" — are both
  // synonyms for something. The app already owns this sentence once, on an
  // account: `priceVisibility` is "the switch that decides whether they see X".
  // This is the same sentence about a deliverable, so it is the same noun, and
  // the two read as one idea rather than two inventions.
  clientVisibility: { term: "Client visibility", def: "The switch on a deliverable that decides whether the client sees it in their portal. Off until you turn it on." },

  // THE AGENCY'S OWN HOUSEKEEPING — the words for the three modules that describe
  // how we run ourselves. Every definition here says, or implies, the same thing
  // the code says at every door: this is ours, and a client never sees it.

  // GOOGLE, CONNECTED ONE PERSON AT A TIME. Every word here carries the same
