   icons/<Name>.svg  ->  icons/icons.generated.tsx  +  icons/index.ts

     node foundations/icons/generate-icons.mjs
     node foundations/icons/generate-icons.mjs --check   (verify only, writes nothing)

   THE SWAP PROCEDURE, which is the reason this script exists:
     1. drop the real <Name>.svg files over the placeholders
     2. run this script
     3. done — no component, no call site, no export name changes

   The generator reads each file's own viewBox, so incoming art may be drawn
   on any grid (28.35 kwapso, 24 lucide, 256 Phosphor) without touching code.

   THE FOLDER IS THE SET. There is no separate required-names list and no
   alias table: every `.svg` file in this folder becomes one named export,
   spelled exactly as its filename. That is the whole contract — a name on
   phosphor.dev resolves the moment the matching <Name>.svg lands here.

   Client ruling, verbatim, overturning the earlier "never rename or drop an
   export" rule for this folder specifically (docs/RULES.md §9.1 records it):
   "I validate the icon mapping, so make sure to make the switch. Any
   previous icon that's on the repo or wherever, kill it. They are wrong.
   The only icons that we are using are these icons from Phosphor. If in the
   future you were to need more icons, we would also take them from
   Phosphor" — 2026-09-03.

   Guards, all fatal:
     · an .svg file whose name is not a valid JS identifier
     · a hardcoded colour in the art (icons take currentColor, or they cannot
       work in both themes)
     · a missing or malformed viewBox
