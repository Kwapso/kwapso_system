/* ============================================================================
   SettingsRoute — the workspace's own switches. Appearance, notifications,
   integrations and the working week.

   ASSEMBLED FROM ONE SHAPE, NOT DESIGNED
     · FormScreen — grouped fields, one commit, the page surface (shape 5).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 26.05 (Settings — not a special case),
   which is the chapter that draws THIS screen; 27.20 (password and security)
   which states the Settings composition's own anatomy; and 27.14 for the
   onboarding step that offers the same three choices.

     ch26.05, verbatim: "Settings has no layout pattern of its own. It's a
       plain page-title header followed by the same underline tab strip used
       on every detail page's sub-tabs (section 4) — five tabs (Appearance,
       Members, Roles, Notifications, Integrations) instead of a record's
       tabs, that's the only difference."

     WHICH CHAPTER'S WORDS THE APPEARANCE PANEL TAKES, AND WHY IT MATTERS.
     26.05 and 27.14 offer the same three choices in DIFFERENT words, and
     both sets are the artifact's. 26.05 draws "Compact / 13px root, tight
     rows.", "Regular / 15px root, the default in both doors.", "Large / 17px
     root, roomy rows." and heads the group "Scale". 27.14 draws the short
     form — "Text size", "13px", "Tight rows." — which is the ONBOARDING
     step's, and `screens/onboarding.tsx` carries it. This screen is 26.05's,
     so it takes 26.05's, verbatim. Neither set is paraphrased and neither is
     mixed with the other.

     ch27.20, verbatim: "Where a member changes their password and sees where
       they are signed in. It is the Settings composition with a sixth tab —
       no vault imagery, no shield icons, no security score."

     The tab row the same chapter draws, in its own order: Appearance,
     Members, Roles, Notifications, Integrations, Security.

     ch27.14 on how a choice is offered, verbatim: "Choices are shown, not
       described … a small picture of the thing, its name, one line, and the
       ring on the one that is picked — never a list of words."

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · SETTINGS IS NOT A SPECIAL PLACE. No vault imagery, no shield, no score.
     It is the same form shell every other form in the app renders through.
   · EACH GROUP IS A GROUP, NOT A CARD. `FormScreen`'s sections are fieldsets
     with an eyebrow and a hairline. ch27.2 forbids cards inside a form.
   · A SWITCH SAYS WHAT IT DOES. Every toggle carries a description line, so
     nothing on this page is a bare word with a control beside it.
   · THE ASSISTANT IS NOT MODAL. Where the assistant has changed one of these
     controls, the application marks that control with a dot and a sentence —
     never a ring, never a lock. `assistantChanged` is the slot for it, and it
     is drawn as the field's own help line rather than as new furniture.

   WHAT NO SHAPE OFFERED — SYS1-5 still open, SYS1-6 CLOSED HERE (2026-08-26)
     · THE TAB ROW. ch27.20's Settings composition carries six tabs above the
       body. `FormScreen` has no tab slot, and `CollectionScreen` — the only
       shape that has one — cannot take a form as its body. This route
       therefore renders ONE tab's worth of settings as groups, and the tab
       row is the application's own navigation until a shape carries it.
     · THE VISUAL OPTION CARD IS BUILT NOW — `AppearanceOptionGroup`, below,
       drawn to 26.05's "How an option panel is built" with override 33's 1px
       ring, and exported so `onboarding.tsx` renders 27.14's step 2 from the
       same block. The Background (spine) group — mango default by override
       56, and THREE options again since the client's ruling of 2026-09-03
       ("you know, i changed my mind. i want to go back to the 3 options
       (sorry)") reversed the 2026-09-02 cut of D3's three to Mango and Quiet
       — ships beside Theme and Scale, which p16 drew and this screen
       previously omitted entirely. Renamed from "Sidebar" to "Background" on
       client instruction once the fill it picks stopped being confined to
       the rail and started painting the whole screen; that renaming stands
       and is untouched by the spine-count reversal.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. `FormScreen` builds the submit handler during its render.

   THE SMALL PICTURES — THE KIT'S OWN ANATOMY, VALUE FOR VALUE.
   26.05 draws every picture as ONE 58px band at radius 24: a 54px rail
   column on the left, then two bars — 8px at 66% over 6px at 88%, 8px
   apart, inside 13px of padding. The THEME pictures are PINNED, and the
   coverage chapter licenses exactly this — "the small pictures of light
   and dark inside the Appearance step": a picture OF a palette cannot
   re-theme with the palette without lying about the choice it depicts.
   The kit's own hexes ship — #FFFEF9 / #F7F2EB / rgba(26,25,24,.30/.12)
   for light, #141310 / #1C1B18 / rgba(255,254,249,.42/.18) for dark, and
   the split System picture's 50/50 gradient with its grey rail #8e8b84
   and grey bars rgba(128,126,120,.55/.30). The SPINE and SCALE pictures
   are NOT pinned, because the kit's own markup draws them from tokens
   (`var(--card)`, `var(--inv)`, `var(--sheet)`, `var(--hair)`) — a spine

/** The spine pictures: the rail column in each of its fills, rows beside it.
    Token-drawn, as the kit's own markup draws them.

    IT STAMPS `data-spine` AND READS `--spine-fill`, RATHER THAN NAMING A
    TOKEN PER SPINE. The 2026-09-02 cut from three spines to two proved why:
    the OLD version of this component switched on the name and reached for
    `--spine-ink-fill` / `--spine-paper-fill` directly, which meant editing it
    in three places just to follow a token rename. Stamping the attribute the
    real screen stamps (`ScreenShell` puts `data-spine` on the screen root)
    makes the picture resolve through tokens.css §7b itself — the SAME
    cascade the real rail paints from — so it is correct by construction and
    cannot drift from the thing it depicts. THE 2026-09-03 REVERSAL PROVES IT
    THE OTHER WAY: going from two spines back to three touched this file not
    at all, beyond the type one line down.

    The ground is `--surface-page`, the paper the real rail stands on (in
    light it is the kit's drawn #FFFEF9; in dark, `--card` would render the
    ink or paper rail invisible on itself). The bars are the foreground at
    the kit's .30 and .12, and stay outside the rail, so the spine rebind
    reaches the column and nothing else. */

    font size and nothing else: type and spacing move together because

/* ============================================================================
   AppearancePreview — one live picture of the app itself, not a swatch.

   WHY THIS EXISTS. The client, 2026-09-14, choosing between four Settings ·
   Appearance layouts a lane put in front of her, picked the preview-led one —
   a single live preview beside compact controls, replacing twelve small
   option pictures — and ruled on what was wrong with the picture Background
   had: "Represent in the preview better the background (currently it's the
   old coloured navbar only)." The picture available for that job was
   `SpinePicture`, a 44px `THUMB_RAIL` swatch — never meant to carry the
   argument `screen-shell.tsx`'s own reshape makes: "THE GROUND IS THE SPINE,
   AND ONLY THE CONTENT FLOATS" — three looks for the whole app, not just the
   rail. This draws that hierarchy, small, so the three read as different at
   a glance for the reason they are different in the real app:

       spine GROUND        the whole frame           (`AppearancePreview`'s root)
       ├─ RAIL              lies on it, paints nothing
       └─ floating CARD     the one raised thing, off-beige in both palettes
          └─ soft PANEL     the collection/record body, one rung quieter
             └─ off-beige ROW  one title, one meta line, at the chosen scale

   Same four rungs `screen-shell.tsx`'s own diagram draws for the real
   screen. Ink is the strong edge (light ground/card contrast 17.386, the
   client's own reason for keeping three spines: "in light i can choose to
   have a 'dark' background"); paper and mango are the thin case
   `--shadow-lifted` exists to carry — so the shadow is drawn here too, not
   dropped as a simplification, because a preview that fakes the strong edges
   and skips the thin ones would misrepresent exactly the two spines a
   reviewer most needs to trust it on.

   PINNED HEX, NOT LIVE TOKENS — `ThemePicture`'s own fork, for the same
   reason. Dark-mode tokens bind at `:root[data-theme="dark"]` (tokens.css
   §6): a scoped descendant has no selector that says "be dark" while the
   document stays light, so a live preview of a THEME cannot ride the
   cascade the way `SpinePicture` rides spine tokens (bound on
   `[data-spine="…"]`, any element — no document-level attribute needed).
   Every hex below is transcribed, not re-derived: `tokens.css`'s own
   `--kw-*` values, and `screen-shell.tsx`'s own measured ground/card table
   from its reshape note.

       ground   ink   light #1A1918  dark #1C1B18
                paper light #F7F2EB  dark #2F2D28
                mango light #FED069  dark #FED069   (mango does not move)
       card           light #FFFEF9  dark #26241F   (spine-independent)
       panel          light #F7F2EB  dark #1C1B18   (spine-independent)
       ink-on-ground  ink   #FFFEF9  both palettes  (`--spine-ink` for ink is
                                     unconditionally off-beige, tokens.css §7b)
                      paper light #1A1918  dark #FFFEF9  (`var(--foreground)`)
                      mango #1A1918  both  (`--ink-on-accent`; D3's "always
                                     black text" on mango)

   `theme` TAKES `"light" | "dark"` ONLY, ALREADY RESOLVED — never `"system"`.
   A picture has no clock and no `matchMedia` of its own; the caller (wherever
   the person's stored preference is read, the same place `ModeToggle` itself
   resolves it) answers "what does system mean right now" once, before this
   renders. `AppearanceOption`'s own "system" tone stays `ThemePicture`'s job,
   on the small option card beside this preview.

   SCALE MOVES THE ROW'S TYPE ONLY — the same two sizes `ScalePicture` draws
   (title, meta), read larger here because this frame has the room. Nothing
   about how MUCH the row shows changes with scale, for the identical reason
   `ScalePicture`'s own header states: the mechanism this depicts sets one
   root font size and adds no row.

   THE VISUAL OPTION CARD — 26.05's "How an option panel is built", verbatim:
   "A choice that changes how the app looks is never a row of pills and never
   a dropdown. It is one card per option: a small picture of the thing
   itself, the option's name, one line of prose, and a mango In use badge on
   the one that is set. Selection is the 2px charcoal ring around the card —
   no tick, no radio. Three options per group, in a row that wraps."
   · THE RING IS 1PX, NOT 2 — override 33, the client's own "the line is too
     thick": the same `--hairline-ink` every selection ring in the kit takes,
     and `flowchart.tsx`'s node holds the precedent for the exact class.
   · THE BADGE IS MANGO — `variant="default"`, stated, because a bare
     <Badge> was ruled QUIET and this chip is the kit's drawn mango "In
     use". Override 17 makes it legal: marks, not actions.
   · EXPORTED for `onboarding.tsx`. 27.14, verbatim: "The appearance step
     uses the same visual option cards as Settings · Appearance … a small
     picture of the thing, its name, one line, and the ring on the one that

/* p16's Background group. CLIENT RULING, 2026-09-03: BACK TO THREE, verbatim
   "you know, i changed my mind. i want to go back to the 3 options (sorry)."
   This reverses the 2026-09-02 cut of D3's three (Ink, Paper, Mango) to two
   (Mango and Quiet); override 56 still makes MANGO the default, unaffected
   by either ruling.

   INK IS NOT A THIRD TASTE OPTION BESIDE TWO — IT IS THE WHOLE REASON THREE
   CAME BACK. Her words, on why: "my goal is that in light i can choose to
   have a 'dark' background option." Appearance (above, on this same screen)
   decides whether the app reads light or dark; this group decides the
   colour behind everything; Ink is what lets a workspace on the LIGHT theme
   still show a DARK window. That is a real capability, not a mood, and the
   description below says so in plain words instead of naming a token.

   RENAMED FROM "Sidebar" TO "Background", CLIENT INSTRUCTION (verbatim: "on
   settings, we need to rename that last section — it's no longer the sidebar
   but the ground/background you choose the word"), AND THIS RENAMING STANDS
   — it is untouched by the spine-count reversal. The fill this group picks
   paints the ground behind the whole screen — the rail, the space around
   the floating content card, everything behind the app — so a caption that
   said "sidebar", or "spine", would be describing a scope the choice no
   longer has.

   THE COPY IS REWRITTEN HERE, NOT REVERTED. The pre-cut three described
   FILLS — "Charcoal spine, mango active row.", "Soft-paper spine, the quiet
   one." — token language dressed as a caption, banned once "Sidebar" became
   "Background" and doubly wrong for Ink now: this is a group of THREE
   colours again, not two, so a returning reader cannot lean on "the other
   one" to fill in what a name does not say. Each line below states what
   living with the choice is like — no token names, no "spine" (the field is
   labelled Background and that is the word the reader has) — kept to Mango's
   own two-clause length and the room's plain, sentence-case voice; a bright
   colour, a light calm one, and a dark one that does not ask you to change
   your theme to get it. */

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   SettingsSecurity — ch27.20's Security TAB, the body only.

   MISSING UNTIL 2026-08-26. The client deleted `password-security` as a
   SCREEN because "it is the Settings composition with a sixth tab — no vault
   imagery, no shield icons, no security score" — and after the deletion the
   tab's CONTENT existed nowhere. This is that content, transcribed from
   27.20's own markup: the Password panel and "Where you are signed in", two
   soft-paper panels on the body pane, exactly as the other five tabs draw
   theirs. The tab ROW stays the application's navigation (SYS1-5).

     ch27.20's own cards, verbatim where they rule:
       "The password is optional, and says so … Save stays disabled in quiet
        ink until both fields carry something."
       "Consequences before the button — the line above Save says what
        happens: every other device is signed out."
       "Sessions are named, not counted — device, browser, city and last use,
        one row each, with the current one marked by a neutral pill and a
        forest dot rather than being hidden."
       "Revoke is poppy text, and is logged … never a filled red button in a
        list … Sign out everywhere sits last, alone."
       "Two-factor is out of scope for now — no 2FA row is drawn."

   THE DESTRUCTIVE WORDS take override 19's underlined `text` variant in
   override 43's `--destructive-ink` — the AA-passing poppy step — never a
   filled red button.

 *  1. default        — the two panels.
 *  2. hover          — the controls' own.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *  4. active/pressed — the controls' own.
 *  5. disabled       — `disabled` closes both panels; Save is ALSO closed on
 *                      its own condition — "disabled in quiet ink until both
 *                      fields carry something" — which is the chapter's own
 *                      arming, stated by the consequence line beside it.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply here; a tab in flight is 27.6's body
 *                      swap, owned by the route.
 *  7. empty          — cannot occur. A member always has at least the one
 *                      session they are reading this screen over.
 *  8. error          — does not apply. A refused save is the caller's to
 *                      report beside its own field.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply.
 * 10. read-only      — no handlers: the sessions still read at full strength
 *                      and no dead control is drawn (ch24.6).
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  · below `sm` the password fields stack and each session row keeps its
 *    action reachable — "sessions become cards, Revoke stays reachable" is
 *    the chapter's narrow caption, and the row wraps rather than clipping.
 *  · `sm` up: the two password fields sit side by side at the artifact's
 *    720 cap; sessions are one row each with the action at the end.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling. Every inset is logical.
