   BrandRoute — the brand, for reference. NOTHING ON THIS SCREEN IS EDITABLE.

   THE CLIENT'S RULING, VERBATIM (2026-08-23, override 26)
       "you cannot edit those colors from the app!!! the brand screen is for
        reference, so any time we have access to branding (in case i am doing
        a design, f.e.)"

   So it is neither of the two things C14 offered. It is not a form of token
   names (C14-1, what was built) and it is not a swatch picker (C14-2, which
   would have cost a primitive that does not exist). It is a REFERENCE
   SURFACE: it shows the brand — the marks, the colours, the type — so anyone
   who needs a value can look one up, and it offers no way to change any of
   it. There is no field, no save, no cancel, no form element of any kind on
   this route.

   EVERYTHING SHOWN IS READ FROM THE TOKENS, LIVE
   Every swatch is filled with `var(--token)` and every value beside it is
   read off the document with `getComputedStyle` at render, and re-read when
   the theme, the scale or the direction changes. Nothing is transcribed.
   That is the whole point: a reference sheet that carried its own copy of the
   palette would keep agreeing with itself after `tokens.css` changed
   underneath it, and somebody would design against a colour the system had
   stopped rendering months earlier. It CANNOT drift, because there is no
   second copy to drift from.

   IT IS A MAIN SCREEN, AND SINCE THIS SWEEP IT SAYS SO IN CODE
   `SHELL.md`, the merged law: "a main screen is in the navbar; a detail
   screen has breadcrumbs." This sheet is reached from Settings and its
   eyebrow says so, which is the same standing `system/roles.tsx` has — and
   roles is a main screen. It has no breadcrumb, no record, no identity chip
   row, no number pill and no charcoal footer, so it fails every part of the
   detail screen's test; `SHELL.md` records the footer on "zero main screens"
   and this screen wants none.

   What that fixed, and it is the same list `shapes/collection-screen.tsx`
   works through for the same reason:

     · THE OFF-BEIGE BODY PANE. This file used to return a bare `div` and put
       its four blocks straight into the document, so the page, the screen
       card, the rail and the body pane were all missing and the cards in the
       marks block stood on whatever the document happened to be. The four
       levels are drawn once, in `screen-shell.tsx`, and reached through
       `MainScreen`.
     · NO MANGO, AND THAT IS ALREADY LEGAL. Override 26 leaves this screen
       nothing to press, so no `onCreate` is passed and `MainScreen` draws no
       `+` at all — which is the same silence `SHELL.md` grants Archive,
       Activity log and Link sent. It is not a disabled button (ch24.6).
     · NO FIGURES AND NO TABS. A reference sheet has no count to strip across
       the top and no subsets to cut itself into, and `MainScreen` draws
       neither when neither is passed.

   THE HEADING MOVES UP A LEVEL AND THE LINE UNDER IT DOES NOT. The kit is
   exact about what the header band carries — "a header that carries eyebrow,
   title and actions" — so the eyebrow and the title go to `MainScreen` and
   the sentence under them stays in the body, where it already was, drawn by
   the same `Text` as before. It is the FIRST thing in the body rather than a
   fourth thing in the band, because there is no band slot for it and
   inventing one would be furniture the kit does not draw.

   THE FOUR BLOCK HEADINGS STEP DOWN TO `h3`, AND THAT IS THE MOVE'S OWN
   CONSEQUENCE. This file used to draw its page heading itself, as `h1`, with
   the blocks under it at `h2`. `MainScreen` draws the heading now and `Title`
   renders it at `h2`, so blocks left at `h2` would be the page heading's
   SIBLINGS and the sheet would have no outline. Only the element moves —
   `size="h4"` is untouched, so nothing on the screen changes shape.

   THE THREE REGISTERS ARE THIS FILE'S WORDS, HANDED DOWN. `MainScreen` takes
   `loadingBody` / `emptyBody` / `errorBody` precisely so a screen that owns
   its own wording is not forced into the collection's. The sentence under the
   heading swaps away with the rest of the body, which is ch27 law 4 read
   straight — a state is a body swap, and the header band, the rail and the
   pane all stay drawn and stay put.

   IT SHOWS BOTH PALETTES AT ONCE. A brand has a light value and a dark one,
   and a designer looking one up needs whichever the artwork is going on — not
   whichever the reader's own theme happens to be. Each row therefore carries
   the live value for the theme on screen, and the row's fill is the token, so
   flipping the theme flips both together and the sheet stays honest.

   WHAT WAS DELETED, SO IT IS NOT QUIETLY RESTORED
   `BrandValues`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`, `submitLabel`, `onCancel`,
   `cancelLabel`, `submitting`, `disabled`, `fieldLabels`, `fieldHelp`,
   `fieldErrors` and the `FormScreen` shape. SYS1-7 — "the kit has no swatch
   picker and no colour field" — is closed by this ruling rather than by a new
   primitive: the kit needed no colour control, because nobody was ever going
   to pick a colour here.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 27.2 for the page's own bones — an eyebrow
   and a heading over grouped blocks — and ruling 35 for what may be done with
   a picture on it.

     Ruling 35, verbatim: "Photography sits under type, never behind it. A
       header image is a contained card at the top of a page. No text is ever
       placed on it, and no scrim is used to make text survive it."

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · NO COLOUR IS INVENTED HERE, AND NONE IS TRANSCRIBED. This file names
     TOKENS. It writes no hex, and the strings it prints are whatever the
     document currently resolves them to.
   · THE MARK SLOTS TAKE NODES. `lightMark` and `darkMark` are rendered where
     the application puts them; this route ships no artwork.
   · NO CONTROL THAT CHANGES ANYTHING. The only pressable thing the route can
     draw is the error register's retry, because a sheet that failed to load
     still has to offer the one next step (chapter 21).
   · Every user-facing string is a prop. No px, no hex, no `border`.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. The token reader is a hook and a `MutationObserver`.

 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — four blocks: the marks, the colours, the type, and the
 *                      facts a client is shown.
 *  2. hover          — NONE. Nothing on this screen is a target, which is the
 *                      ruling drawn rather than written.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here, and mostly not reachable: the only focusable
 *                      thing the route can draw is the error register's
 *                      retry. tokens.css §8 rings it.
 *  4. active/pressed — the same one control, and only when the sheet failed.
 *  5. disabled       — DOES NOT APPLY, and that is the point. A disabled
 *                      field says "you could change this, but not now"; this
 *                      screen says "this is not changed here at all", and the
 *                      honest drawing of that is no field, not a grey one.
 *  6. loading        — `state="loading"`: the BODY unfills and nothing else
 *                      moves (ch27 law 4) — the rail, the header band and the
 *                      body pane all stay drawn. The swatches wait with it,
 *                      because a swatch reading an unresolved token would
 *                      flash the wrong colour.
 *  7. empty          — `state="empty"`, same mechanism: a reader who may see
 *                      no brand at all.
 *  8. error          — `state="error"`, same mechanism: the sheet failed to
 *                      load, with the retry. Never a per-field error: there
 *                      are no fields.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. Nothing here is chosen.
 * 10. read-only      — THE WHOLE SCREEN, at all times, by ruling. There is no
 *                      prop that turns editing on.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile   — one column throughout: the marks stack, the colour rows stack,
 *             the type ladder stacks, and the facts keep `DescriptionList`'s
 *             two columns at every width because that is the kit's own grid.
 *             Nothing scrolls horizontally: a swatch row truncates its token
 *             name rather than widening the page.
 *  tablet   — the colour rows go to two columns.
 *  desktop  — three. The type ladder stays one column at every width, because
 *             a ladder read across columns is not a ladder.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling.
