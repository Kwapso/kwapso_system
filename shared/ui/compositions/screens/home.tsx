/* ============================================================================
   HomeRoute — `/home`, the system door's ONE landing screen. Figures, then
   the work.

   THERE USED TO BE TWO OF THESE
   Two agents independently built the same screen: `dashboard.tsx` at `/` and
   this file at `/home`. Client ruling G, 2026-08-22, verbatim: "landing for
   the system is always home." This file survived, `dashboard.tsx` is gone,
   and `/` is a redirect declared as `SYSTEM_ROOT_REDIRECT` in the barrel.
   What `dashboard.tsx` had and this file did not was merged in first — the
   fifth analytical tile, `onFigureSelect`, and `figuresVisible`; each is
   marked "from dashboard.tsx (ruling G)" where it lands. See GAPS-RULINGS.md.

   ASSEMBLED FROM TWO SHAPES, NOT DESIGNED
     · StatStrip          — the headline numbers (shape 3)
     · CollectionScreen   — heading, tabs, toolbar, rows, pager (shape 2)
   The strip is handed to the collection's own `figures` slot rather than
   stacked above it, because ch27.1 fixes the region order — figures, folder
   tabs, then the panel with toolbar, rows and pager inside it — and law 1
   forbids a screen inventing a second spine to hold them apart.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 27.1 (main page) and 27.11 (dashboard).

     ch27.1, the region order, verbatim:
       "Figures, folder tabs, then the collection panel — toolbar, rows, pager
        inside it. A collection may drop the figure strip; it may not reorder
        what remains, and filters never sit above the tabs."

     ch27.11 on what a figure is for, verbatim:
       "A figure or a card is a link to the collection that produced it,
        filtered the same way. A dashboard that cannot be opened into its
        records is a poster."

     ch27.1 on the figures themselves, verbatim: "Three or four counts a
       person would act on. The strip is not an analytics surface — a fifth
       number belongs on the dashboard."

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · IT DRAWS NOTHING. Every element on this page comes out of a shape. This
     file supplies content, wiring and words, and writes no layout of its own
     beyond the one wrapper the shapes are handed to each other through.
   · THE SYSTEM DOOR IS `comfortable`. Commission §9: "The system app is
     dense, wide, and used all day by staff."
   · FIVE FIGURES, AND THE FIFTH IS THE QUESTION. From dashboard.tsx, ruling
     G. ch27.1 caps the strip at four "and a fifth number belongs on the
     dashboard" — this screen IS the dashboard now, so `maxFigures={5}` and
     the fifth tile is 27.11's "one chart that answers a stated question",
     two columns wide, its label the question. Nowhere else gets five.
   · NEVER MORE THAN THREE SERIES. The one three-series spark plots build,
     support and overrun, which is the ceiling: `--chart-4` and `--chart-5`
     repeat 1 and 2 today, so a fourth would draw two indistinguishable pairs.
   · EVERY NUMBER IS A LINK (27.11). From dashboard.tsx, ruling G. Each
     default tile carries an `onSelect` built from `onFigureSelect`, because
     "a dashboard that cannot be opened into its records is a poster".
   · ONE MANGO ON THE PAGE. The primary create is last in the action row and
     nothing else on the screen is filled. No tile takes `tone="brand"`.
   · A FIGURE THE READER MAY NOT SEE RENDERS NOTHING (ch24.6). From
     dashboard.tsx, ruling G: `figuresVisible={false}` draws no strip at all,
     never a greyed one.
   · EVERY STRING IS A PROP. Headings, tab labels, column headers, action
     labels and the empty-state words all default here and all override.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. Both shapes it composes are client components.
