/* ============================================================================
   OnboardingRoute — what a member meets the first time they open the system
   door, after an invite. Three steps, then the app. Never a tour.

   ASSEMBLED FROM TWO SHAPES, NOT DESIGNED
     · StepperHero — the step rail that names all three from the start (shape 4)
     · FormScreen  — the step's fields and the one footer (shape 5)
   Nothing else. The rail is a sibling of the form, not a second spine: it is
   the same page, and ch27 law 1 only forbids a screen splitting itself into
   two panes with their own navigation.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 27.14 (onboarding).

     ch27.14 on the surface, verbatim: "Onboarding takes the whole window with
       the kwapso mark at the top — it is not a dialog over a dimmed app,
       because there is nothing behind it worth looking at yet. It appears
       once, after an invite is accepted, and never again."

     ch27.14 on the three steps, verbatim: "Who you are (name, photo,
       timezone), how it should look (theme, spine, scale), what you work on
       (the accounts or apps you own). Three is the ceiling. The step rail
       names all three from the start, so nobody is walked blind."

     ch27.14 on what it must never be, verbatim: "The system never points at
       its own interface. No spotlight, no coach marks, no 'next tip'."

     ch27.14 on the footer, verbatim: "Back and Next stay at the bottom in the
       same order as everywhere else: retreat left, commit right."

     ch27.14 on the last screen, verbatim: "It says what is waiting — tickets
       assigned, apps openable, people on the account — and ends with one
       mango Start that lands on the member's first real screen. Never a
       dashboard of zeroes."

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · THREE STEPS, AND THE COUNT IS STATED. The rail is drawn from the first
     frame with all three named. A step may be skipped; none is hidden.
   · EVERY VALUE HAS A DEFAULT AND NOTHING IS MARKED INCOMPLETE. ch27.14 says
     so in those words, so no step passes `missing` and no field is required.
   · ONE MANGO, AND IT MOVES FORWARD. `FormScreen`'s commit is the only filled
     control on the page; Skip is the cancel variant beside it.
   · NO TOUR FURNITURE. No spotlight, no bubble, no progress percentage. The
     rail is the whole orientation.
   · THE STEPS' CONTENT IS THE APPLICATION'S. This file ships the three the
     kit names and the fields it names inside them, and every string is a prop.

   WHAT NO SHAPE OFFERED — logged as SYS1-2 and SYS1-3 in GAPS-SYSTEM1.md
     · `StepperHero` couples the drawing to the door, and its three doors
       expect seven, three and four stages. ch27.14's rail is a THREE-step
       numbered rail; `door="delivery"` draws the numbered rail but expects
       four, so the shape warns in development. The drawing was kept and the
       warning logged, because `door="portal"` would draw stage pills and put
       the client vocabulary on a system screen, which ruling 04 forbids.
     · The appearance step's "visual option cards" ARE a primitive now —
       `AppearanceOptionGroup`, built in `settings.tsx` to 26.05's "How an
       option panel is built" and imported here, because 27.14 says this step
       "uses the same visual option cards as Settings · Appearance". The
       badge reads "Picked" (27.14's word) where Settings reads "In use".
       This step also offers the SIDEBAR group — ink / paper / mango — which
       p27 draws between Theme and Text size and this file previously
       omitted; client ruling D3 offers all three and override 56 defaults
       mango.


   IT IS ON NEITHER OF THE TWO SCREEN MODELS, AND THAT IS THE CHAPTER'S CALL
   `SHELL.md` has exactly two screens and one test between them: "a main
   screen is in the navbar; a detail screen has breadcrumbs." This screen is in neither
   place, and 27.14 says why in its own words: "Onboarding takes the whole
   window with the kwapso mark at the top — it is not a dialog over a dimmed
   app, because there is nothing behind it worth looking at yet." A WHOLE-
   WINDOW REPLACEMENT is the one family `SHELL.md` keeps outside the two: it
   draws no rail, because the rail is the application's navigation and the
   member has not reached the application yet, and there is no parent
   collection for it to keep lit.

   IT IS NOT THE SAME CASE AS 27.30 AND 27.38, though all three are wizards
   and 27.38 groups them by their RAIL AND BUTTON ORDER, which is
   `StepperHero` and not the shell. The two chapters say opposite things:
   "the whole CONTENT AREA with the rail and header intact" (27.30, 27.38) is
   `ScreenShell`, and both of those screens are now on `MainScreen`; "the
   whole WINDOW with a mark at the top" (27.14) is the auth family's shell,
   which is what this file draws. `screens/onboarding.tsx` sets out all three
   quotations at length.

   So this screen keeps its own shell and is NOT migrated onto `MainScreen` or
   `DetailScreen`. Recorded here rather than left silent, because the next
   reader sweeping for the four levels will otherwise "fix" it.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. Both shapes it composes are client components.

 *  6. loading        — `state="loading"`: the rail stays, the body unfills.
 *  7. empty          — does not apply. Every step has fields, and a step with
 *                      nothing to answer would not be one of the three.
 *  8. error          — `state="error"`: the block failure inside the form.
 *  9. selected       — the current step in the rail, and the ringed card in
 *                      each option group.
 * 10. read-only      — does not apply to onboarding.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — the form is one column below the form
 *  breakpoint and two above it, which `Form`'s own grid owns. The rail folds
 *  its tail rather than restacking, which `StatusStepper` owns.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling.
