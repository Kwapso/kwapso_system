   CompanyHubScreen — CH27.43, "Company hub · A record detail whose subject is
   a company".

   COMPOSED, NOT DRAWN
     · Image        — the header image, at 3 / 1 (override 27). A contained
                      card at the box radius, with nothing written on it
                      (ruling 35).
     · DetailScreen — the kit's second screen: `ScreenShell`'s four levels
                      with the three things a record puts in them, and
                      `RecordChrome` (shape 1, which IS 27.8) under it. The
                      title is in the header band; the identity row, the line
                      tabs, the one opaque panel and the footer are on the
                      body pane.
     · StatStrip    — the four figures, in the hero slot.
     · Avatar       — the logo. A company is a THING, so the square mark at 48.
     · List         — the modules and the people.
     · the ink footer — `RecordChrome`'s, through `DetailScreen`. "Latest" is its left column and the
                      key/value pairs its right; this file supplies content and
                      composes no feed of its own.
   Not one fill, radius, type step or ring is written in this file.

   DESIGN SOURCE — KWAPSO-SPEC.md CH27, composition 27.43.

     The strapline, verbatim:
       "One page per account: the image, the logo, the figures, the modules,
        the people, the history. It is the record detail anatomy from 27.8
        with a company at the top of it — because 'how is Padelbase doing' is
        a question the agency asks constantly and the kit could not answer."

     The image's own caption, verbatim:
       "Header image · a contained card, never a bleed"

     "The image is a card, and the type is below it", verbatim:
       "A contained band with 24px corners at the top of the page, and nothing
        written on it. Every word — logo, name, figures — sits on the paper
        underneath, so the page reads whatever photograph the client gave us."

     "The logo is a record mark", verbatim:
       "A company is a thing, so it takes the square mark at 48px (ruling 30).
        A supplied logo is placed inside that square, never floated free and
        never allowed to set its own shape."

     "Four figures, and one is money", verbatim:
       "Modules, open records, retainer used, people. Retainer is the figure
        the conversation is actually about, so it is never the one that gets
        cut on a narrow screen."

     "It is 27.8, with a company in it", verbatim:
       "Same identity row, same figures row, same panels, same log. Nothing
        about the subject being a company changes the composition — only what
        the panels hold."

     "Doors differ", verbatim:
       "The client sees this page as their own home: same anatomy, their logo,
        their image, and the retainer figure replaced by what is in flight.
        Internal notes and the people panel are not shown."

     Narrow, verbatim: "Narrow: image, then everything in one column".

     Ruling 35, verbatim: "Photography sits under type, never behind it. A
       header image is a contained card with 24px corners at the top of a
       page. No text is ever placed on it, and no scrim is used to make text
       survive it."

   THE TAB WORDS ARE THE APPLICATION'S TO CHOOSE. THE KIT SHIPS NONE.
   This is the whole of N4(a), and it is a correction of the design side's
   behaviour rather than a design decision. The client, verbatim and
   exasperated: "n4 none of those! we are not going so in detail here, that's
   part of the dev team! you have nothing to do here defining words, we are
   only working on the design. focus!"

   They are right, and the question should never have been put to them. What
   a company page calls its sections is a product's information architecture
   — it depends on what the two apps actually keep behind each tab, which is
   the dev team's knowledge and not the kit's. Naming them was not design
   work. FOUR candidate sets were drawn and one was picked BY THE DESIGN LEAD
   (override 35: Overview / Activity / Files); the client then said the whole
   question was out of scope, so override 35 is REVERTED and the default is
   gone rather than swapped for a fifth invention.

   WHAT THAT MEANS IN THE CODE
   `tabOverview`, `tabActivity` and `tabFiles` still exist on
   `CompanyHubLabels` — the props stay, and they stay required-in-the-shape —
   but they DEFAULT TO THE EMPTY STRING. Their key names are three SLOTS the
   kit holds open, not three words the kit proposes. An application fills the
   slots with its own vocabulary. Hand this screen none and it draws NO STRIP
   at all: `RecordDetail` says "absent or empty, no strip is drawn", and no
   strip is also what 27.43's own drawing has, so the wordless default is the
   chapter's own picture rather than a hole where a decision should be.

   IT IS NOT A BLANK SCREEN. The panels, the figures, the identity row, the
   image and the footer all draw with no caller at all. Only the words nobody
   is entitled to choose are missing.

   · (c) THE HEADER IMAGE IS 3 / 1. Override 27, ruled by the client, and it
     stands untouched. See `imageRatio`.
   · (b) THE PORTAL'S THIRD FIGURE IS "WITH US NOW". Override 36, and the
     CLIENT ANSWERED IT explicitly before calling the question out of scope.
     A ruling given is a ruling: it stands and is not reverted with (a). It
     lives on `portal/company.tsx`, not here.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · THE IMAGE IS A CONTAINED CARD, NEVER A BLEED, AND CARRIES NO WORD.
     `Image` is rendered in `DetailScreen`'s `banner` — first thing inside the
     OFF-BEIGE BODY PANE, above the identity row and above every word on the
     page, which is what ruling 35 asks for. Not as a background, not
     full-bleed, and not in the hero slot (which sits under the title and would put the type on top
     of the picture's band rather than the picture above the type). It has no
     children slot in this file, no overlay, no scrim and no gradient: there
     is no prop on this screen that could put a word on the photograph.
   · THE LOGO IS A SQUARE MARK AT 48. `Avatar shape="square" size="lg"`,
     ruling 30 exactly. A supplied logo goes INSIDE it as `AvatarImage`; there
     is no way to hand this screen a free-floating logo.
   · FOUR FIGURES, AND THE RETAINER IS NEVER THE ONE CUT. `StatStrip` caps at
     four, all four survive a 380 viewport by STACKING rather than dropping,
     and a call site that hides the retainer figure warns in development.
     `retainerFigure` names which one is the money.
   · IT IS 27.8. The identity row, the tabs, the panels and the footer are
     `RecordChrome`'s. This file adds exactly one region — the image — and the
     chapter's own narrow rule is "image, then everything in one column",
     which is what that ordering produces at every width.
   · NOTHING IS CENTRED. 27.37 is the only centred composition in the kit.
   · Every user-facing string is a prop. No px, no hex, no `border`, no
     gradient, no blur.

   THE DIVERGENCE THAT WAS LOGGED HERE IS CLOSED (DEF-1, 2026-08-23)
   CH27.8's charcoal two-column footer card is what `RecordDetail` region 4
   draws now. "Latest" moved out of the panel into the footer's left column
   and the key/value pairs are its right. THE HUB DRAWS NO NOTE FIELD: 27.43
   gives a company no internal log to append to, and the hub is a page the
   client may be shown through the portal door. Said here rather than left to
   an absent prop.

   NARROW (380px) — THE CHAPTER NAMES A SPECIFIC RULE AND IT IS OBEYED
   "Image, then everything in one column."
     · The image keeps its ratio and its 24 corners and stays contained: it
       spans the column, never the viewport, and nothing is written on it. At
       380 the ruled 3 / 1 is a ~113px band, which is a header; the 16/9 it
       replaced was ~200px, more than half a phone screen of picture before
       the company's own name.
     · Everything below it is already one column — 27.8: "the reading column
       stays single" — so nothing restacks.
     · ALL FOUR FIGURES SURVIVE. `StatGrid`'s auto-fit drops to one column at
       380, which STACKS the four rather than cutting any, so the retainer —
       the figure the conversation is about — is on the screen at every width
       by construction, not by a media query someone has to remember. A caller
       that sets `visible: false` on the retainer is warned in development.
     · The modules and people rows put their trailing value beside the name
       and truncate the name, so no row wraps to three lines.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. The tab handler and the row handlers are built during this
   module's own render.

 *  2. hover          — the rows', the tabs' and the buttons'. The IMAGE does
 *                      not hover, does not zoom and does not dim: ruling 35
 *                      puts photography under type, and a picture that moved
 *                      under the pointer would break that with motion instead
 *                      of colour.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *  4. active/pressed — the controls' own.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. A reader who may not act is passed
 *                      `actionsVisible={false}` and sees no action rather
 *                      than a grey one (CH24.6).
 *  6. loading        — `state="loading"` unfills the panel and keeps the
 *                      image, the logo, the name and the figures drawn. The
 *                      IMAGE has its own `imageLoading`, because a photograph
 *                      arrives on its own schedule and the box must hold its
 *                      shape while it does.
 *  7. empty          — `state="empty"`: an account with nothing on it yet.
 *  8. error          — `state="error"` for the panel; `imageError` for the
 *                      picture alone, which says so in the box rather than
 *                      collapsing the page's top.
 *  9. selected       — the active tab, owned by the shape.
 * 10. read-only      — the normal case. Nothing on this page is a field.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  · 380 — image, then everything in one column. All four figures stack and
 *    none is cut, so the retainer is always on the screen.
 *  · tablet / desktop — the figures spread across the strip and the panels
 *    keep their single reading column.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling. Nothing here names a side.
