   NotFoundScreen — composition 27.23.

   THE ONE SENTENCE
   "A URL for a record that has been deleted, moved, or never existed. Unlike a
   denial (27.7) there is nothing to ask for, so the screen's job is to say
   what it can about the number and hand back a route."

   DESIGN SOURCE — "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 27.23, verbatim:

     IT NAMES THE NUMBER EVERY TIME
       "The record number is stated in the chip and in the sentence. 'Not
        found' without a number is unanswerable — the reader cannot tell
        whether they mistyped, followed a stale link, or lost something real."

     THREE CASES, ONE COMPOSITION
       "Deleted, moved, or never existed. Same card, same two paper buttons;
        only the sentence changes, and only the moved case earns a mango
        because there is somewhere to go."

     THE OTHER TWO CASES
       "Moved: '4182 now lives in Collection B', with a mango button that
        opens it there — the one time this screen carries a mango.
        Never existed: 'There is no record 9999 in Collection' — no date, no
        actor, no apology, and the same two paper buttons."

     IT IS NOT A DENIAL
       "A denial (27.7) says who can grant access; this says what happened.
        Never soften one into the other — telling someone a record does not
        exist when they simply cannot see it is a lie the log will
        contradict."

     THE FRAME STAYS DRAWN
       "Rail, header and the collection's actions remain, because the
        collection is fine — one record inside it is not. Only a whole-page
        failure or a dead session (27.19) may replace the frame."

     NO 404, NO CODE, NO CARTOON
       "The words say it. No status number, no illustration, no 'oops'. The
        tone is the same as a deletion dialog: plain, specific, unembarrassed."

     DOORS DIFFER
       "In the portal a record that has left the client's workspace reads
        'this isn't in your workspace' with a route back to their own
        overview — it never names another client and never says who deleted
        it."

   WHICH FRAME STAYS: THE COLLECTION'S, SO THIS IS A MAIN SCREEN IN A STATE
   THE FRAME STAYS DRAWN, quoted above, is the whole answer: it names the
   frame's parts —
   rail, header, and the COLLECTION's actions. `SHELL.md`'s test settles which
   of the two screens owns those: "a main screen is in the navbar; a detail
   screen has breadcrumbs", and every one of this screen's own defaults is a
   main screen's — the eyebrow reads `Group · 24 records` (scope, then count),
   the heading is the collection's name, and the two controls are the
   collection's Export and its create. There is no breadcrumb here, no
   identity chip row, no record number pill and no charcoal footer, because
   the record this URL asked for does not exist to have any of them.

   So this is not a screen of its own: it is `MainScreen` with its BODY
   swapped, which is ch27 law 4 exactly — a state swaps the body and nothing
   else moves. The register rides `emptyBody`, and the rail, the header band,
   the eyebrow's real count and both controls are drawn straight through it.
   That is also why this file passes `state="empty"` rather than
   `state="error"`: ruling 06's block failure is a collection that could not
   be listed, and this collection listed perfectly.

   THE STEP-DOWN WAS REMOVED, 2026-08-24, AGAINST THE RENDERED PAGE
   This screen used to step the header's create DOWN to a paper glyph on the
   `moved` variant, reading 27.23's "the one time this screen carries a
   mango" as a ration of one across the whole screen. p31 draws `Export` and
   a **mango** `+` on 27.23's header, and 27.22's rule card states the family
   rule in words: *"The page-level mango + stays in the header where it
   always is."* 27.23's sentence is about the BODY — `moved` is the only one
   of the three cases whose register offers a way on, and the other two end
   in two paper buttons. So the header's `+` is mango in all three cases and
   the `registerHasMango` test is gone. NF-1 in GAPS-KIT-F.md.

   HOW THIS IS KEPT DISTINCT FROM 27.21, 27.22 AND 27.7
     · The subject is ONE RECORD, named by its number, in a chip and again in
       the sentence. No other register in the family states a record number.
     · The collection's own count stays REAL in the eyebrow — the collection
       is fine. 27.21's zeros would be wrong; 27.22's facet chips would be
       wrong; there is nothing switched on here.
     · There is nothing to ask for, so there is no grantor, no Request and no
       reference — those belong to 27.7 and must never appear here.
     · Mango appears in exactly ONE of the three cases: `moved`.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · NO STATUS CODE, ANYWHERE. There is no "404" string in this file and no
     prop that could carry one.
   · THE NUMBER IS SAID TWICE — chip and sentence — and both come from one
     `record` prop, so they cannot drift.
   · MANGO ONLY WHEN `case="moved"`. In `deleted` and `missing` both controls
     are paper, which is the artifact's "same two paper buttons".
   · EVERY STRING IS A PROP with a default; the three sentences are three
     separate props so a locale can order actor, number and date its own way.
   · No CSS `border`, no px, no literal colour, no illustration.
   · Focus is one global rule. Dark is a token flip.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. The two routes out carry handlers.
