/* ============================================================================
   PortalHome — the client's landing screen: what we are waiting on them for,
   how their deliverables are progressing, and what the work has saved them.
   The savings figure CANNOT be rendered without the arithmetic behind it.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" — and the honest first sentence is that the kit
   does not draw this screen. Chapter 27's closing paragraph names it as owed,
   verbatim: "Still owed, and named so it cannot be forgotten: the process
   map's editing state, a citation format for assistant answers, the rule for
   showing a calculation's inputs, a portal home of its own, and the saved
   switch between calendar and table — the portal's differences live inside
   each composition."

   So this file is assembled from the rules the kit DOES state about the
   portal, each quoted where it is used:

     ch27.41, doors differ, verbatim: "Clients never see this. The portal
       equivalent is 'waiting on you', which lists the three things it needs
       from them with no queue mechanics at all."

     ch27.34, doors differ, verbatim: "The portal notifies on three things
       only: kwapso replied, a deliverable is ready to review, and we are
       waiting on you. No assignments, no mentions, no automations."

     ch27.11, doors differ, verbatim: "The portal's dashboard shows only that
       client's own numbers, drops Retainer used unless their contract has
       one, and never shows team, owner or capacity figures. Three stages, so
       its chart has three series."

     ch27.11 on stating a period, verbatim: "Every other number in the system
       is stated with the period it belongs to … and never moves while you
       look at it."

     ruling 05/06 on where the flourish is allowed, verbatim: "The mango
       ambient field stays, scoped to auth, splash and portal home."

     chapter 4 on a savings figure that goes the wrong way, verbatim: "A
       negative bar — the portal keeps its axis because savings can regress —
       is poppy at each mode's value."

     ch24.6 on rights, verbatim: "Permissions HIDE actions rather than
       disabling them, so a client never sees a button they can't press."

   IT IS A MAIN SCREEN, AND SINCE 2026-08-23 IT SAYS SO IN CODE
   The client's test: "a main screen is in the navbar; a detail screen has
   breadcrumbs." The portal's landing screen is the portal's navbar, so it is
   a main screen and it now renders `MainScreen` — which is `ScreenShell`'s
   four levels. Before this it returned a bare `div` with a measure on it: no
   page, no screen card, no rail and no OFF-BEIGE BODY PANE, which is the
   level `SHELL.md` says the whole rebuild turned on.

   IT KEEPS THE PANEL, AND THE FIRST PASS AT THIS GOT IT WRONG. The reasoning
   for dropping it was that a landing screen is not a collection, so level 4 —
   "the collection / the record body" — is not there. Measured, that was
   false: `ProgressDashboard` draws the deliveries band as a
   `Card variant="raised"`, and `card.tsx` says a raised card "only reads as
   raised when it sits inside a `--surface-panel` band". `--card` and
   `--surface-page` are the same hex in light, `#FFFEF9`, so the band measured
   1.000 against the pane and was not an object at all. `SHELL.md`'s nesting
   is body pane → soft-paper PANEL → cards, and the bands are the cards. The
   panel is drawn; no toolbar and no tab come with it, because none is
   passed, which is right — ch27.41 says this list takes "no queue mechanics
   at all", and it has no subsets to cut.

   THE FIELD MOVED, AND IT IS RECORDED RATHER THAN QUIET. Ruling 05/06 allows
   the mango flourish here. It used to lie behind the whole screen because the
   screen was one transparent column; it now lies on the SCREEN CARD, under
   the rail and the header band, because the body pane above it is opaque and
   a field behind an opaque pane is a field nobody sees. `ScreenShell` takes
   it as a node so the ruling's scoping stays at the three call sites that
   have it.

   THE FIGURE AND ITS ARITHMETIC ARE ONE OBJECT
   Commission §9 item 10: the savings figure "must always render its
   explanation beside it". RULING D7-3 = 3A (2026-08-24) then said what that
   explanation IS — the arithmetic, always open, never a sentence and never a
   link. A prop that can be omitted is not good enough for either, so the
   guarantee is built three ways at once and none of them can be routed
   around:

     1. THERE IS NO `figure` PROP. `PortalHome` takes one `savings` object or
        none at all. The number and the sum are fields of the SAME object, and
        `inputs` is not optional in the type — leaving it out is a compile
        error at the call site, not a runtime surprise.
     2. THERE IS NO CODE PATH THAT EMITS THE NUMBER ALONE. `PortalSavingsFigure`
        builds exactly one tile, and the tile is only built after the
        arithmetic has been checked. There is no `hideInputs`, no `compact`,
        no slot override, and no branch that skips it.
     3. EMPTY INPUTS DELETE THE FIGURE, NOT THE SUM. A caller reaching this
        from untyped JavaScript with `inputs: []`, or with rows whose labels
        and values are all blank, gets `null` for the whole block and a
        development warning. The number is what disappears, because a number
        nobody can check is worse than no number at all.

   PH-2 IS CLOSED. It was logged in GAPS-SHAPES2.md because "the kit owes the
   rule for showing a calculation's inputs", so the shape of the explanation
   had to stay the caller's own node. The rule now exists and the shape is
   `PortalSavingsInput[]`.

   THE PORTAL'S LARGER TYPE IS THE ROOT SCALE, NOT A SIZE PER COMPONENT
   Commission §9 calls the portal "narrow, calm, larger type"; GAPS-COL3 SCR-3
   left the last of those three open. The position taken here, and the reason,
   is in this file's header rather than buried: `density="calm"` sets the
   MEASURE and the heading step, and the type ladder is moved by the app
   setting `data-scale="large"` on `<html>`. tokens.css §1 already ships three
   root sizes for exactly this, manifest.json already records that "the portal
   deliberately sits one step above the system app", and a shape that bumped
   its own steps would fork the ladder for one door — every component would
   need the same fork, dark would stop being a token flip, and the reader's
   own text-size control would fight it. Recorded as PH-1 in GAPS-SHAPES2.md.

   ============================================================================
   RULING D7-4, 2026-08-24 — THE PORTAL'S HOME, AND THE REGION ORDER REVERSES
   ============================================================================
   The client, on `verify/decide-2.html` §D7 proposal 4: "your proposal i like
   it." The proposal is ruling G's frame with the portal's own contents and
   four named differences, and all four are built here.

   FIRST, THE CORRECTION THE DRAWING ITSELF CARRIES. Ruling G settled which
   FILE is the system's home; it did not settle a layout. The layout is
   CH27.1's, which predates it and states the region order for a main screen,
   verbatim: "Figures, folder tabs, then the collection panel — toolbar, rows,
   pager inside it. A collection may drop the figure strip; it may not reorder
   what remains, and filters never sit above the tabs."

   THE FOUR DIFFERENCES, EACH ONE STRUCTURAL RATHER THAN ADVISED:
     1. TWO FIGURES, NOT FIVE. "A client has no ticket queue to count." The
        strip is `savings` plus `figure`, and `figure` is SINGULAR — there is
        no array to grow and no third slot.
     2. NO FOLDER TABS. "The middle region is optional in CH27.1 and the
        portal has no folders." There is no `tabs` prop; the region is an
        absence, not a flag.
     3. THE SAVINGS FIGURE CARRIES ITS EXPLANATION INSIDE THE TILE, "because
        PH-5 makes them inseparable and that is not negotiable here" — and
        since ruling D7-3 the explanation is the arithmetic.
     4. WAITING-ON-YOU FIRST, THEN DELIVERED. "The portal's list is a to-do,
        not a queue." One list, and the two arrays are joined by the component
        in that order.

   WHAT THIS REVERSES, SAID PLAINLY. This file's own law used to read: "THE
   REGION ORDER IS NOT THE CALL SITE'S. Waiting, then deliveries, then the
   savings. A figure above a thing the client is blocked on tells them we are
   pleased with ourselves while they wait." That reasoning was sound and it is
   overruled: the client saw the figure-first drawing and took it. What
   survives of it is the half that was never about order — the order is still
   not the call site's, it is just a different order. GAPS-SHAPES2 PH-3 is
   updated rather than quietly left standing.

   THE HOME DROPS A REGION; IT DOES NOT DELETE ONE. `ProgressDashboard` stays
   on this shape as region 4 because `/impact` needs it, and CH27.1's rule is
   that a screen may DROP a region rather than that every screen carries the
   same ones. The home passes no `deliveries`: its deliverables are the
   strip's count and the list's delivered rows, which is what the drawing
   draws.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · NO QUEUE MECHANICS ON "WAITING ON YOU" (ch27.41). Structural: this shape
     offers no sort, no facets, no pager and no tabs for that list. They are
     not defaulted off; they are absent.
   · THE REGION ORDER IS NOT THE CALL SITE'S. Figures, then the list, then the
     progress bands. A call site chooses which regions it HAS and never where
     they sit — CH27.1's own rule.
   · A REGION THE READER MAY NOT SEE RENDERS NOTHING. `visible={false}` on the
     deliveries and the savings is `ProgressDashboard`'s and `StatGrid`'s own
     rule (ch24.6) and is not reimplemented here.
   · NEVER MORE THAN THREE SERIES anywhere near this screen — `--chart-4` and
     `--chart-5` repeat 1 and 2. This shape plots nothing at all, which is the
     safest way to obey it; a spark belongs to `StatStrip`, which cuts to
     three and says so.
   · Focus is one global rule. No ring, no radius, no fill written here.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. The rows carry select handlers built during this module's
   own render.

   RULING D7-3 = 3A, 2026-08-24 — THE RULE FOR SHOWING A CALCULATION'S INPUTS
   ============================================================================
   CH27's closing paragraph owed "the rule for showing a calculation's
   inputs", and `verify/open.html` §C21 named the screen it blocked and the
   exact question, verbatim: "PH-5 already makes the figure and its
   explanation inseparable, so the number never appears alone — but the RULE
   for showing the inputs behind it is the part the artifact owes. Owed: does
   the client see the arithmetic, a sentence, or a link."

   The client answered `3A`, which `verify/decide-2.html` §D7 drew as "the
   arithmetic, always open": "The inputs sit under the figure permanently, as
   label / value pairs over a rule. Nothing is hidden and nothing has to be
   pressed." Its drawing, transcribed:

       Saved this quarter
       €18,400
       Hours removed            460 h
       Blended rate             €45 / h
       Licences retired         €2,700
       ────────────────────────────────
       Q3, to 24 Aug            €18,400

   THE ARITHMETIC IS NOW WHAT SATISFIES THE GUARANTEE, AND THAT IS A REAL
   CHANGE, NOT A RESTATEMENT. `inputs` is REQUIRED and `explanation` is now
   OPTIONAL — the exact reverse of what this file shipped yesterday. The
   reason is that 3B was the sentence and 3B is the REJECTED option: if prose
   still satisfied the requirement and the numbers were optional, a caller
   could ship 3B and the ruling would buy nothing. So the thing that cannot be
   left out is the thing the client ruled for. The guarantee itself is
   untouched in strength and is arguably stronger: an empty `inputs` deletes
   the FIGURE, exactly as an empty explanation used to, because a number
   nobody can check is worse than no number at all.

   `explanation` SURVIVES AS AN OPTIONAL SENTENCE, drawn between the figure
   and the arithmetic where `StatGrid` already puts the support line. 3A's
   drawing carries none, so nothing in the kit renders one by default; a
   caller with something to say that is not an input may still say it.

   THE TOTAL ROW IS THE PERIOD AND THE FIGURE, NOT A NEW PROP. The drawing's
   last line is "Q3, to 24 Aug · €18,400", which is `period` and `figure`,
   both of which already exist. It is drawn under the rule whenever there is
   a `period` — and ch27.11 requires one on every number in the system, so in
   practice always. With no period there is no rule either: a rule under
   nothing is a rule under nothing.

   WHAT THE DRAWING SAYS IT IS MADE OF, AND THE ONE PLACE THIS DEPARTS
   3A's own "Made of" line: "`StatGrid`'s tile with `DescriptionList` in place
   of the sparkline slot; the rule is `--hair-strong`, the figures are
   `tabular-nums` per ruling R2. No new component." All four are honoured —
   the pairs are a real `DescriptionList` in `StatItem.chart`, which is the
   sparkline slot, and no component is added. The one adjustment: the
   drawing pushes every value to the tile's INLINE END and `DescriptionList`
   left-aligns its value inside a `1fr` column. Rather than grow the
   component a per-item alignment it has never needed, the label track is
   `max-content` and each value node carries `block text-end` — so the figures
   line up at the edge the drawing lines them up at, and `DescriptionList` is
   unmodified.

 *  2. hover          — the row wash, owned by `List`, and only where a row
 *                      opens something.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *  4. active/pressed — not drawn for a row: pressing one navigates, and the
 *                      acknowledgement is the destination (GAPS-COL3 LST-4).
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. A client who may not act is passed no
 *                      action, which is ch24.6's rule and not a grey button.
 *  6. loading        — each band unfilled at its own row heights, the heading
 *                      and the band labels kept (ch27.6). Never a spinner.
 *  7. empty          — the screen: "Nothing is waiting on you". A band on its
 *                      own can be empty while the others are not, which is
 *                      law 4 applied inside a panel.
 *  8. error          — ruling 06's block failure, with the retry.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. Nothing here is a choice.
 * 10. read-only      — the normal case. Nothing on this screen is editable.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — one column at every width, which is the point
 *  of the calm door: there is no second spine to collapse (ch27 law 1). The
 *  bands wrap their own contents, the savings tile fills its row, and the
 *  measure is `density`'s.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling. Logical properties throughout.
