/* ============================================================================
   Rail — THE NAVBAR. Shape 0c, the third region of the shell.

   WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL
   `ScreenShell` has taken a `rail` node since the day the four levels were
   built, and NOTHING IN THE DELIVERY DREW ONE. No `components/` folder, no
   `compositions/` file, and not one route supplied a value — every route
   threads `rail` straight through to the shell and every route left it
   undefined. Forty screens rendered with no navigation in them.

   That is worse than a missing component, because the client's own test for
   the two screen types is:

       "a main screen is IN THE NAVBAR; a detail screen has breadcrumbs."

   The navbar was the half of that test the delivery could not draw. A mini
   app assembled one out of `Button` and `Avatar` an hour before this file was
   written, purely so it could exist; that stopgap is superseded by this and
   `mini-app/rail.tsx` now imports from here.

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   CLIENT FEEDBACK, ROUND 1, 2026-08-24 — TWO CHANGES, BOTH IN THIS FILE
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Verbatim, both about this component:

     (1) "on sidebar, where there's the person name, i want only the first
          name, not full name. Also, no role. remove the role"
     (2) "on the sidebar, 'sections' have no icons, but pages do (the
          opposite as now)"

   (1) THE FIRST NAME IS A SEPARATE PROP AND IS NEVER DERIVED. `RailMember`
   gains `givenName`, and the chip draws `givenName ?? name`. THIS FILE DOES
   NOT SPLIT THE NAME, and that is a correctness decision, not fastidiousness:
   splitting on whitespace takes "María" out of "María José", "van" out of
   "van der Berg", the FAMILY name out of any register written family-first,
   and half a mononym out of a mononym. The kit ships `Languages`, an RTL
   audit in every component header and three RTL locales named in the repo
   (Arabic, Urdu, Persian) — a component that guesses at a name would be wrong
   in production on day one. The APPLICATION holds the person record and knows
   which field is the given name; the component cannot infer it and does not
   try. A call site that passes no `givenName` gets the full name, unchanged
   and uncut, which is the only safe fallback.

   AND THE FULL NAME SURVIVES FOR ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY. A screen reader that
   announced "María" where the record says "María José García" would be worse
   off than a sighted reader, which is a loss and not a simplification. So
   when the two differ the visible given name is `aria-hidden` and the FULL
   name is carried in an `sr-only` span: the eye reads the first name, the
   accessible name of the chip is the whole one, and neither is said twice.
   When they are the same the chip renders one span and nothing is hidden.
   Collapsed, the tooltip has always carried `member.name` and still does.

   `role` STOPS RENDERING. The prop is kept — it is typed, it is documented as
   removed, and it draws nothing anywhere — because the kit is vendored into
   two applications this repo cannot see and a deleted field is a build break
   for a change that is purely visual. Every call site in this repo has had it
   removed. See `RailMember.role`.

   AND THE CHIP'S GEOMETRY WAS RE-LOOKED AT, NOT JUST SHORTENED. Two lines of
   14/500 over 13/300 measured ~37.8 tall, which is TALLER than the 32 avatar
   beside them — so the TEXT was setting the chip's height and the avatar was
   floating in ~5.8 of slack. One line measures ~19.6, so THE AVATAR NOW SETS
   THE HEIGHT and the `--space-1` padding around it becomes real: 4 + 32 + 4 =
   40, a 999 pill whose radius (20) is the avatar's (16) plus its own padding,
   which is the concentric chip the kit draws everywhere else. Nothing had to
   be added to hold it up; the two-line chip was the one that was loose. The
   flex COLUMN that stacked the name over the role is gone with the role —
   a one-item column is a box that only reads as a mistake later.

   (2) THE ICONS SWAP SIDES, AND THE ARTIFACT AGREES WITH THE CLIENT. Checked
   rather than taken on trust, in three places:

     · 26.02's own sidebar specimen draws an icon on EVERY destination —
       `<svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="14" height="14">`, five of them, one
       per row, `opacity:.65` when idle and full when lit — and NO icon on a
       group heading. What sits beside a group label there is a `0 0 12 8`
       9x6 TRIANGLE at `opacity:.5`, rotated -90° on the closed group: that
       is the COLLAPSE CHEVRON, which the same chapter names twice ("Grouped
       sections with a collapse chevron per group"; "Group collapse (chevron,
       left) is separate and persists per user"). It is a control, not a
       glyph.
     · The System template — the source of the client's own reference
       screenshot, with Today / Meetings / Tasks / Apps / Sprints / Tickets /
       Backlog / Accounts / Audits / Capacity / Settings under MY WORK, BUILD,
       COMPANY, SYSTEM — draws `<path d="{{ item.icon }}">` on every
       destination and the same 9x6 chevron on every heading.
     · Chapter 27's assembled miniatures draw neither: bare labels under bare
       uppercase headings, because they are miniatures.

   So the build had it exactly backwards, and the reason is visible on screen:
   `icon` had no default so no destination drew one, while the heading's
   chevron rendered in the repo's PLACEHOLDER artwork — a rounded square with
   dots, not a triangle — and therefore read as an icon. The client was
   pointing at the chevron.

   WHAT WAS DONE WITH THE CHEVRON, AND IT IS A JUDGEMENT. It could not simply
   be deleted: it is the group's only collapse affordance and the chapter
   states the feature twice. It could not stay where it was: it is the thing
   the client asked to remove. So IT MOVED TO THE TRAILING EDGE OF THE
   HEADING, hugging the label rather than pinned to the column's far side, so
   the heading now BEGINS with bare uppercase type — which is what the
   client's reference reads as — and the disclosure survives, with its
   `aria-expanded` and its rotation, in the position a disclosure conventionally
   takes when the label leads. The only thing lost is the chapter's word
   "left", which this file could never honour literally anyway: every inset in
   here is logical because the rail runs in RTL. Logged in the register; if
   the client wants the chevron gone outright, that is one line and it costs
   the group collapse.

   WHAT AN ENTRY WITH NO ICON DOES IS NOW A REAL QUESTION, AND THE RULE IS
   PER-RAIL, NOT PER-ENTRY. If ANY destination in the rail carries an icon,
   EVERY destination reserves a `--icon-button` slot — empty where there is no
   glyph — so one icon-less entry cannot pull its label 24px left of its
   neighbours. If NO destination carries one, no slot is drawn at all and the
   labels sit flush, which is what chapter 27's miniatures draw and what a
   rail whose application has not chosen a vocabulary should look like. The
   alternative — always reserve — indents every label in an icon-less rail
   past an empty column, which is a defect on 40 screens to protect a case
   that cannot arise there.

   NO GLYPH IS INVENTED FOR A NAMED DESTINATION. That refusal stands and this
   change does not touch it: what moved is the LAYOUT. `icon` still has NO
   DEFAULT on `RailItem`. The one register that gained glyphs is
   `PLACEHOLDER_GROUPS`, whose WORDS are already the kit's placeholders — see
   the note there.

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   THE CLIENT RULED ON BOTH OF THIS FILE'S OPEN QUESTIONS, 2026-08-24
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Shown `verify/decide.html`, the client answered:

     D1 = A, WITH A CONDITION. Verbatim: "d1- a. but also variations depending
     on light/dark and the settings of the navbar. see screenshots for
     reference." So the active row STAYS MANGO, per 26.02 and register row 53
     — override 17's two-mango count is accepted and closed. The condition is
     that the row varies with the palette and with the spine, which it now
     does, through `--spine-active-*`.

     D3 = ALL THREE SPINES. Verbatim: "d3 offer teh threee! but on mango
     backgorund always baclk text!" Built, as tokens (tokens.css §7b). The
     second half is A LAW, not a preference: any mango ground carries charcoal
     type. `--ink-on-accent` was already right; the mango spine's QUIET ink is
     charcoal too, because the artifact states no second ink on a mango ground
     anywhere (155 mango grounds, 155 of them `color: #1A1918`) and the
     derived `--ink-on-accent-secondary` (#5E5030) is an olive-brown the
     client's own screenshots contradict.

     D5 = C, and it closes the question D3 left open. Verbatim: "d5 c" —
     THE QUIET TIER IS MADE BY WEIGHT AND SIZE, NOT BY COLOUR. So no second
     ink is derived for the mango ground, `--ink-on-accent-secondary` is never
     reached for in this file, and the hierarchy comes off the type scale.

     IT IS APPLIED ON ALL THREE SPINES, WITH NO BRANCH, AND THAT IS THE POINT.
     C is a ruling about HOW hierarchy is made, not about mango, and a rail
     whose quiet tier worked one way on one ground and another way on the
     other two would be two components wearing one name. So the weight and
     size distinction is unconditional — and the colour distinction is NOT
     removed from the grounds that have one, because 27.1 draws it: its idle
     rows are `color: var(--fg2)` and its group headings `var(--fg3)`, on 28
     rails. `--spine-ink-quiet` keeps doing that job on ink and paper, and on
     mango it resolves to charcoal so it contributes nothing and weight and
     size carry the whole hierarchy. One mechanism, one code path, and the
     ground decides how much of it is visible.

     THE STEPS ARE THE KIT'S AND THE ARTIFACT ALREADY DREW THEM. 27.1's own
     rail makes the lit/quiet distinction by WEIGHT: its active entry is
     `font-weight: 500` and every idle entry carries none. This file had put
     500 on EVERY row and spent the whole distinction on colour. Corrected:

         lit destination     --text-sm      14 · --font-weight-medium  500
         quiet destination   --text-sm      14 · the body weight       300
         group heading       --text-micro   11 · medium, uppercase, 0.08em
         a count             --text-caption 13 · the body weight
         member's name       --text-sm      14 · medium
         their role          --text-caption 13 · the body weight
                             ↑ REMOVED by the client, 2026-08-24. The step is
                               left on the record because the ruling that set
                               it (D5 = C) is unchanged and the row is what a
                               reader will look for when they ask where the
                               second line went.

     Nothing there is new: 11 is the eyebrow step `Title` already draws its
     own eyebrow at, so the smallest thing in the rail is at the size the
     system already ships for that role and not below it.

   THIS REVERSES THIS FILE'S OWN REASONING ABOUT THE ROW'S SHAPE, AND SAYS SO.
   Until today the row was a PILL, and the argument written here was "three
   drawings to one, plus a stated law": 26.01's "All controls: 999px radius,
   no exceptions", plus 27.1 and chapter 15 both drawing an inset pill in
   situ, against 26.02's specimen alone. THE CLIENT'S SCREENSHOTS ARE A FOURTH
   DRAWING AND THEY AGREE WITH THE CHAPTER — the active row spans the rail's
   column edge to edge, square, with no inset. 26.02's dev note said so in
   words the whole time: "Active state is always a full-bleed mango row —
   never a left border, never just bold text." A row that stops short of the
   column's edges is not full-bleed, and the pill was reading 26.01's law
   about CONTROLS onto a row that the chapter had already exempted by name.
   Built full-bleed and square. The in-situ pill is gone, not kept beside it.

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   THE MANGO SPINE IS PALETTE-INDEPENDENT BY DESIGN, AND THAT IS A DECISION
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Written down because an audit on 2026-08-24 read the mango spine's raw
   `--kw-charcoal` / `--kw-off-beige` values as an accident — somebody having
   reached for a brand constant where a palette token belonged. They are not
   an accident, and the alternative is worse in a way that is easy to check.

   26.02: "mango is unchanged in both palettes." The ground is #FED069 in
   light AND in dark, and #FED069 has a relative luminance of about 0.66 — it
   is a LIGHT ground. **A mango spine in dark mode is a light ground wearing a
   dark palette.** What reads against a surface is decided by the surface, not
   by the theme, so everything standing on the mango spine has to be chosen
   for a light ground in BOTH palettes. It follows that the mango spine's
   contents cannot follow the palette; if the ground does not move, nothing on
   it may move.

   Swapping the constants for their palette-mapped equivalents — the obvious
   move — breaks it immediately: `--surface-inverse` flips to off-beige in
   dark, so the "charcoal fill, off-beige label" active row 26.02 states would
   become an OFF-BEIGE row on mango, measuring 1.44 against its own ground
   with a charcoal label on it. The chip would go the same way through
   `--card`. So the raw constants are the correct reading of the chapter and
   the palette tokens are the trap.

   THE SAME LOGIC IS WHY `markField` PICKS THE CUT FROM THE SPINE AND NOT FROM
   THE MEDIA QUERY, below. One rule, applied twice.

   ONE VALUE GENUINELY BROKE THIS AND IT IS NOT ONE OF THE TWO THAT WERE
   FLAGGED. `--spine-active-hover` on the mango spine points at
   `--btn-inverse-hover`, which DOES flip — #333230 light, #ECE8DF dark —
   because it is the hover for a ground that inverts, and the mango spine's is
   a ground that does not. MEASURED on the default spine in dark: the lit row
   hovers to #ECE8DF and its #FFFEF9 label falls to **1.211**, with the row
   itself at 1.189 against the mango. Light is correct at 12.683. The fix is
   one line in `tokens.css` §7b — pin `--spine-active-hover: #333230` on
   `[data-spine="mango"]`, which is that file's own existing light value and
   introduces no new hex — and `tokens.css` is another agent's file today, so
   it is ROUTED rather than edited here. Until it lands, the default spine's
   lit row has a broken hover in dark and nothing else does.

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   THE RAIL IS A CONTAINER AFTER ALL, AND THE ARTIFACT ALWAYS SAID SO
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   `SHELL.md` used to say the rail LIES ON the screen card and paints nothing.
   That was true of the pixels and false about the ladder: every rail in
   chapter 27 — 28 of them, 22 expanded and 6 collapsed — is drawn
   `background: var(--sheet)`, and the frame behind it is `var(--page)`. The
   rail painted nothing and still looked right only because the build had the
   card soft paper too. With the card corrected to off-beige, an unpainted
   rail is a rail that disappears.

   THE FILL IS THE SHELL'S, NOT THIS FILE'S, and that is the one thing worth
   arguing about here. The spine has to run the column's FULL HEIGHT and reach
   its edges; the column's padding belongs to `ScreenShell`. So the shell
   paints the column and publishes its padding as `--rail-inset`, and the rows
   below bleed back out through it. This file names no colour and no inset: it
   reads `--spine-*` and `--rail-inset` and nothing else.

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   GEOMETRY, AND WHERE THE CHAPTER'S NUMBERS WENT
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   · WIDTH — "Fixed 208px" (26.02). The shell owns it (`RAIL_WIDTH`, 13rem);
     this file writes no width in its expanded form and fills the column.
   · RADIUS — `rounded-pill`, both states. See the reversal above (the
     expanded row was briefly square, then reversed live, repeatedly, by the
     client). The COLLAPSED row has always kept 999: 27.8 and 27.1's tablet
     render both draw the icon rail as a column of circles, "at the same
     circular size as the avatar", and a square inside a 32-wide column is
     not a thing the kit draws anywhere.
   · "FULL-BLEED", RETIRED 2 Sep 2026 — the expanded row used to bleed edge to
     edge of the rail's COLUMN, out through the shell's own padding via
     `--rail-inset`; the client asked for "a bit of blank space on the sides"
     instead, so it now sits inside that padding like every other row (see
     `ROW_EXPANDED`'s own header). The label's own position is unaffected
     either way — it was never on the negative margin, only the row's outer
     box was.
   · COLLAPSED ICON — 26.02 says "the same 36px circular size as the avatar".
     THE AVATAR LADDER HAS NO 36. Ruling 30 states three sizes absolutely and
     they are 24 / 32 / 48. The caption's operative words are "the same size
     as the avatar", so the icon is `--avatar-md` (32) and matches the member
     chip's mark exactly, which is the thing the sentence is actually about.
     The 36 is logged as a value off the ladder.
   · COUNTS — 26.02 says "no item counts", in the caption, flatly. 27.1 draws
     `Collection 24` and chapter 15 draws `Tasks 6`. `count` therefore exists
     as a prop WITH NO DEFAULT and no entry in the placeholder register below
     carries one: a route that wants the kit's in-situ spelling can ask, and
     nothing draws a count by accident.
   · DISABLED — 27.7, verbatim: "The rail shows the door it won't open …
     Blocked items stay visible in disabled ink rather than disappearing."
     So a blocked row keeps its place and takes `--spine-ink-disabled`, and
     it takes NO FILL — `Button`'s one disabled treatment is a fill and an
     ink, and a fill here would make an unreachable row the loudest object in
     a column where nothing else is filled. Logged as this file's one
     departure from the shared disabled skin. On the PAPER spine that token
     is `--btn-disabled-label`, unchanged from before; on ink and mango it is
     the spine's own quiet ink, because the artifact draws no blocked row on
     either ground and a third ink tier there would be invented. Owed.

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   WHY THE ROW WRITES ITS OWN SKIN INSTEAD OF RENDERING A `Button`
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Because a rail entry may be a LINK. GAPS-D PAG-2 records this as a
   system-wide trap: `button.tsx` guards every interactive rule with
   `enabled:`, `:enabled` matches form elements only, and an `<a>` wearing
   `buttonVariants` silently loses its hover with nothing to see in review.
   `pagination` already answered this by copying the geometry and branching on
   the resolved state in JS, and PAG-2's own recommendation is a state branch
   rather than the `enabled:` guard. This file does the same: ONE skin, both
   elements, the three states resolved in JS so no two rules ever race.

   Everything that is not the row is a shipped primitive: `Logotype` /
   `Isotype` for the mark, `Avatar` for the member's face, `Tooltip` for the
   collapsed label, the kit's icons for the chevrons.

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   THE RAIL'S HEAD IS ONE IMAGE AND NO TYPE AT ALL
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Two client instructions, 2026-08-24, verbatim:

       "side by side the word! love it!"      → the full horizontal LOCKUP
       "no tagline on the sidebar, only this" → and nothing else

   So the head is `Logotype` — the glyph and the word as ONE piece of
   artwork — and `wordmark` and `tagline` both default to `null`. The build
   drew a letter in an `Avatar` square, then an `Isotype` beside the name set
   in the interface face, then 26.02's tagline under it. All three are gone.

   ITS SIZE IS ONE RUNG OF THE ICON LADDER, AND THE CLIENT SET IT.
   Verbatim, with a reference screenshot: "the logo on top of sidebar smaller,
   check screenshot for reference". Measured off that reference, the lockup is
   about 48% of the rail's width — ~100px in a 208 column, ~20 tall at the
   4.9986:1 ratio, against the ~41.6 tall it was drawing at the column's full
   width. Roughly half the height. That is a change, not a nudge.

   `MARK_STEP` below is `--icon-20`, the ladder's rung under the 24 the brand
   file's own `sm` uses. 100 IS NOT HARD-CODED ANYWHERE: `brand.tsx` derives
   the width from `--brand-step * --brand-ratio`, so the step is a HEIGHT on
   the kit's own scale and the width falls out of the artwork's measured
   aspect. At the 16px reference root that is 99.97 x 20 — 48.06% of a 208
   rail, which is the reference to two decimal places, arrived at from the
   ladder rather than from the screenshot.

   THE MARK IS SIZED BY HEIGHT, NOT BY `w-full`, AND THAT IS THE FIX'S SHAPE.
   The head used to take the padded column's whole width. A 5:1 lockup pinned
   by its HEIGHT has a width nobody controls, which is why `brand.tsx` is
   width-driven — but pinning `--brand-step` drives the width THROUGH that
   same formula rather than around it, so the component's own mechanism still
   owns the geometry, `max-w-full` still catches any overflow, and the
   rectangle is still final on the first frame so nothing under the head moves
   when the SVG lands.

   THE CLEAR SPACE UNDER IT IS THE POINT, NOT A SIDE EFFECT. The reference
   reads the lockup as a quiet header rather than a banner, and that is the
   PROPORTION of mark to the space below it, not the mark's size alone. The
   rail's own block gap is `--space-6`; against the old 32 mark that was 0.75
   of its height, and against the new 20 it is 1.2. The gap did not move —
   shrinking the mark is what bought the air, which is why the gap is left on
   the rail's rhythm instead of growing a bespoke one.

   COLLAPSED, IT IS THE `Isotype`, AT THE SAME STEP. At the icon rail's width
   the lockup cannot fit — five to one would be a few pixels tall — and the
   isotype is the same artwork's mark half at 0.9999:1, effectively square.
   IT TAKES `MARK_STEP` TOO, so the expanded lockup and the collapsed mark
   stand exactly the same height and read as one mark in two states. It was
   `md` (32) while the lockup was 32-ish; leaving it there would have made the
   collapsed mark TALLER than the expanded one, which is the whole rail
   disagreeing with itself. Note this is deliberately NOT 26.02's "same
   circular size as the avatar" — that sentence is about the destination
   ICONS, which are still `--avatar-md`; the brand mark is not a destination.

   NEITHER IS `decorative`. That prop exists for a mark standing next to the
   product's name in real type, and there is no such type here any more: the
   artwork is the only thing naming the product in this rail, so it keeps its
   accessible name and `label` carries it.

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   THE APPLICATION OWNS THE ROUTE
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The repo ships components, not routing. An entry takes an `href`, a
   handler, or both, and `current` is a plain id the application resolves from
   whatever router it has. Nothing in here reads a location, and the parent
   collection STAYS LIT on a detail screen (`SHELL.md`: "the rail never
   changes between them") because `current` is the collection's id on both
   screens and this component cannot tell which of the two it is inside.

   THE WORDS ARE THE KIT'S. 27.1's in-situ register — Group / Overview /
   Collection / Settings / Member name — is the default because it is what the
   kit draws on the forty screens this default will appear on. 26.02's
   specimen register (Group label / Active item / Sibling item / Another group
   / Item / Collapsed group / Person name / Their role) says the same thing in
   the chapter's own placeholder voice. No product vocabulary is invented for
   a navigation entry anywhere in this file.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. The rail owns two pieces of interaction state — which
   groups are closed, and whether the whole rail is collapsed — and both are
   uncontrolled-with-an-escape-hatch, because 26.02 says both "persist per
   user" and persistence is the application's.

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   THE ACTIVE ROW — mango, ruled, and now spine-aware.

   Client ruling D1 = A: the row is the chapter's mango. Register row 53 is
   answered and the in-situ off-beige pill it recorded as the alternative is
   deleted rather than parked, because a rejected alternative left in the file
   is the next reader's "three drawings to one".

   Every value is a token so the row re-paints with the spine and with the
   palette, which is the client's own condition ("but also variations
   depending on light/dark and the settings of the navbar"). On ink and paper
   that resolves to mango with a charcoal label; on mango it INVERTS, to

   AN IDLE ENTRY, AND D5 = C's COLOUR HALF IS OVERRULED ON THIS ROW, 2026-09-02.

   Until today this was 26.01's ghost — `--spine-ink-quiet`, darkening to
   `--spine-ink` on hover — which is what D5 = C asked for: "THE QUIET TIER IS
   MADE BY WEIGHT AND SIZE, NOT BY COLOUR", with the colour distinction kept
   wherever a ground already had one (ink and paper read `--fg2`-shaped quiet
   ink; only mango had none). That reading is live on screen now, and the
   client's verdict on all six spine × theme combinations she reviewed is
   verbatim: "nav text should ALWAYS be either pure black or pure white — never
   gray — depending on what it sits on."

   THAT IS A NARROWER LAW THAN D5 = C, NOT A DIFFERENT ONE, and this row is
   where the two collide. D5 = C is still right about WEIGHT AND SIZE carrying
   the lit/quiet distinction — `ACTIVE_TREATMENT`'s `font-weight-medium` against
   this row's body weight is untouched — and it is still right that the mango
   spine has no second ink, which `--spine-ink-quiet` already resolves to
   `--ink-on-accent` for and this change does not disturb. What the client is
   removing is the ink AND paper spines' own quiet tier, which used to read
   `--ink-on-inverse-secondary` (light ink spine, #d5d1c9) or `--muted-
   foreground` (dark ink and paper, #bdb9b1 / #5f5d59 in light paper) — three
   real greys an idle row was resting in. So THIS ROW takes `--spine-ink`
   outright, the same full-contrast token the row already darkens TO on hover,
   which makes the hover rule redundant and is why it is gone: charcoal on
   mango and paper-in-light, off-beige on ink and paper-in-dark, unconditionally
   and at rest.

   NOT TOUCHED: the group heading (`text-[var(--spine-ink-quiet)]` two blocks
   down, still `--text-micro` and still quiet — a heading is not a nav item and
   the client's sentence was about "nav text") and the idle count badge, for
   the same reason. `--spine-ink-quiet` ITSELF is unchanged in tokens.css, so
   neither of those moved. Scoped to the one thing the client actually looked
   at: the destination's own label.

   ADDENDUM, SAME DAY — WEIGHT BECOMES A THIRD, EXPLICIT SIGNAL, NOT JUST THE
   BODY'S DEFAULT. `ROW_SHAPE`'s own comment above still says "no weight here
   … a row's resting weight is the body's", and the body's IS `--font-weight-
   light` (300, the only weight below `--font-weight-medium` this face ships —
   see tokens.css §5) — so nothing here contradicts that. What changed is that
   it is now named instead of merely inherited, and a HOVER step is added:
   the client wants three signals reading together (fill, colour, weight), not
   two, and wants hover to preview the ACTIVE weight without previewing the
   active FILL — "the pill is earned by being current, not by being pointed
   at." So an inactive row hovers to `--font-weight-medium`, `ACTIVE_TREATMENT`'s
   own weight two names below, with no `--spine-active-fill` wash added — this
   class carries no `hover:bg-*` and never has. */

   THE LANE ABOVE THE COLLAPSED FACE — SPACE THIS FILE RESERVES FOR A CONTROL
   IT DOES NOT DRAW, AND THAT SENTENCE IS THE WHOLE OBJECTION TO IT. Answered
   rather than dodged, because the alternative is worse and was tried.

   CLIENT, 2026-09-06, VERBATIM: *"when contracted place he button avobe the
   avatra round image"*. The button is `ScreenShell`'s edge handle — the one
   that replaced this file's own foot toggle on the 2026-09-02 approval (see
   `RailProps.collapsible`, still typed, still off, still never to be turned
   on) — and the shell positions it absolutely inside the rail DOCK, which is
   this component's own containing box.

   THE COLLISION, MEASURED BEFORE ANYTHING WAS BUILT. Collapsed, this rail's
   foot gap is the root's `gap-[var(--space-6)]` — 22.5px between the last nav
   row and the face. The handle is `--control-height-button` (37.5) and sits
   `--space-3` (11.25) above the face, so it wants 48.75 of that 22.5 and
   covers 26.25px of the LAST NAV ROW. The nav is a scroller and its last row
   is a real destination sitting at the bottom of its box whenever the register
   is longer than the column — which on a product rail it always is. A
   destination under an opaque mango circle is a destination nobody can press,
   and this file has shipped a visible-but-unpressable control once already.

   WHY THE RESERVATION LIVES HERE AND NOT IN THE SHELL. Three ways were open:

     · PAD THE RAIL COLUMN FROM THE SHELL. The shell can add padding to the
       column, but the column's padding is OUTSIDE this component — everything
       in the rail moves up together, the face included, and the strip that
       opens up is BELOW the face, which is the one place the client did not
       ask for the button. It cannot put air between two of this file's own
       children.
     · REACH INTO THIS FILE FROM THE SHELL with an arbitrary descendant
       variant (`[&_[data-slot=rail-member]]:mt-…`). That works and is the
       worst of the three: the shell would be writing this component's
       internal layout from outside, through a selector that breaks silently
       the day a `data-slot` moves, with no comment on this side to warn the
       next reader why their margin has a value they did not write.
     · PUT IT ON THE `<nav>` AS `mb-…`. One place instead of two, but that
       element already carries the negative `-m-[…]` focus-ring gutter, so a
       `mb-` would REPLACE the bottom half of it (tailwind-merge resolves `mb`
       over `m`) and slice the focus ring off the last row — trading a
       covered row for an invisible focus state. Expressible only by folding
       `--focus-offset` and `--focus-width` into this calc as well, which
       makes a spacing decision unreadable to protect a line width.

   So it is a margin on the FACE, declared and explained on the side that owns
   the layout. It is `--control-height-button + --space-3` — the button's own
   height plus the same gap the shell places it at — and it is ADDITIVE to the
   root's `--space-6`, so what a reader sees above the button is that same
   `--space-6` the collapsed foot always had, with the button sitting in the
   new lane below it. Every term is a token the two files already share; no
   number is written down in either.

   IT IS SCOPED TO THE COLLAPSED STATE ONLY. Expanded, the handle straddles the
   dock's trailing edge beside the chip and is not in this column's flow at
   all, so there is nothing to reserve and nothing is reserved.

   AND A `Rail` MOUNTED WITHOUT A SHELL KEEPS THE LANE. Accepted knowingly: the
   collapsed rail gains 48.75px of air above its face and nothing stands in it.
   The alternative is a prop — `handleLane`, or worse a `hasEdgeHandle` — which
   would make forty call sites responsible for a fact that is true of every one
   of them, and would be the second source of truth for a state this repo has
   twice now reduced to one. `Rail` is documented throughout as the shell's
   navbar; a standalone mount is a specimen page, and a specimen page with
   slightly airy feet is not a defect anyone can see. */

   THE PLACEHOLDER REGISTER — 27.1's, verbatim.

   This is the default the shell falls back to, so it is what forty screens

   two groups called Group, four then three entries, Overview first, Gear

   product's.

   IT NOW CARRIES GLYPHS, AND THAT IS NOT THE INVENTION THE FILE REFUSES.
   The client asked for an icon on every destination and this register is what
   the shell falls back to, so without glyphs here the change would be
   invisible on the forty screens the client actually looks at. The refusal
   that stands is about NAMED destinations — deciding that "Tickets" or
   "Capacity" means a particular mark is the application's vocabulary and the
   kit does not get to set it. THESE WORDS ARE NOT NAMED DESTINATIONS: they
   are the kit's own placeholders, "Collection" five times over, and a
   placeholder word takes a placeholder glyph. Each of the three distinct
   words takes the icon whose NAME in the kit's own set is the same concept —
   a summary for Overview, a library for Collection, Gear for Gear —
   so nothing is coined and nothing is asserted about a real screen. All icon
   ARTWORK in this repo is still placeholder (ICON-LANGUAGE.md: "No glyph has
   been drawn"), so all three render the same rounded square today and what
   the register demonstrates is the ARRANGEMENT, which is what was asked for.

/**
 * The navigation rail — the navbar a main screen is in.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — mark and wordmark, grouped entries with one lit, the
 *                      member chip at the foot. No fill of its own: it lies
 *                      on the screen card's soft paper.
 *  2. hover          — a quiet entry's ink darkens to full (26.01's ghost);
 *                      a lit entry's fill moves to `--spine-active-hover`.
 *                      Collapsed, a tooltip carries the label as well.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      and every entry in here is a real `<a>` or `<button>`.
 *                      The ring follows the control's own radius, so an
 *                      expanded row rings as a pill — square until v1.2.22,
 *                      when `ROW_EXPANDED` became one (this line said "square
 *                      now" for a day after it stopped being true). The nav
 *                      that holds these rows scrolls, and a scroll container
 *                      clips: it keeps a `--focus-offset` + `--focus-width`
 *                      pad so a ring on the first or last row is not sliced.
 *  4. active/pressed — the 1px downward nudge AND NOTHING ELSE. 26.01: "Press
 *                      state is a 1px downward translate, no color flash."
 *                      Never on a blocked row.
 *  5. disabled       — per ENTRY, not per rail. 27.7: a blocked entry stays
 *                      visible in disabled ink and takes no fill, "so the
 *                      workspace doesn't look different to different people".
 *  6. loading        — does not apply. Law 4: "either way the rail, header and
 *                      tabs stay drawn and stay put." The rail is what stays
 *                      put, so it has no loading form and takes no `state`.
 *  7. empty          — `groups={[]}` draws the mark and the chip and no
 *                      entries. A rail with nothing in it is a real condition
 *                      (a role that can open one screen) and it is not an
 *                      error, so no register is drawn over it.
 *  8. error          — does not apply, same reason as 6. A dead session
 *                      replaces the window (law 4's one exception) and that
 *                      screen renders no shell at all.
 *  9. selected       — this is state 1's lit entry, and it is the whole point
 *                      of the component: `current` lights exactly one, and it
 *                      stays lit while a record from that collection is open.
 * 10. read-only      — does not apply. Navigation edits nothing.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile  — ABSENT. `ScreenShell` drops the rail entirely below `md` and no
 *            hamburger is drawn, because the kit draws none anywhere. This
 *            component has no narrow form on purpose: a narrow form would be
 *            something for a route to reach for.
 *  tablet  — present, and the width the kit shows collapsed (27.1's tablet
 *            render is the icon rail). The state is the application's;
 *            nothing here changes with the viewport.
 *  desktop — the expanded 208 column.
 *
 * RTL — safe. Every inset and gap is logical, the tooltip's `side="right"` is
 * Radix's physical side and is the only physical name in the file; the mark,
 * the chevron and the count all take their position from flex order.

            `flex-1` so the toggle and the member chip are pinned to the foot
            at every height, which is what every in-situ screen draws.

            AND `min-h-0` + `overflow-y-auto`, SINCE 2026-09-02, BECAUSE THE
            FOOT WAS NOT ACTUALLY PINNED. Client, verbatim: "when i svroll
            down the expand/collpase button in navbar also moved. make sure
            this does not happen." Until today this component scoped NO scroll
            region of its own anywhere, so a rail with more entries than fit
            had to be scrolled by the APPLICATION — and the only box an
            application can reach is the whole `Rail`, foot included, which is
            precisely why the toggle and the chip travelled with the list.
            Owning the scroll here is the fix, and it belongs here: only this
            file knows which of its children are the list and which are the
            foot. `min-h-0` is half of it and not optional — `flex-1` alone
            still floors this item at its content's height (`min-height:auto`
            is a flex item's default), so without it nothing can ever overflow
            and `overflow-y-auto` would never fire. The toggle and the chip
            are siblings AFTER this element, so they are structurally outside
            the scroller and cannot move, expanded or collapsed.

            THE GUTTER IS NOT SPACING, AND IT IS NOT A NEW NUMBER. A scroll
            container clips its OTHER axis too (CSS: `visible` computes to
            `auto` opposite a non-`visible` value), and tokens.css §8 rings
            every control at once with a `--focus-width` line held
            `--focus-offset` off its edge — so a focused row against any of
            this box's four edges would have its ring sliced off. The negative
            margin and the equal padding cancel each other exactly, so the
            entries' content box is the byte-for-byte one they already sat in
            and every gap in this column is unchanged; only the clip moved out
            of the ring's way. */}
