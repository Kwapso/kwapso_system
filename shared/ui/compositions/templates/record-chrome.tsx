/* ============================================================================
   RecordChrome — the four regions every record screen is made of: a
   transparent header band, a sticky tab strip, one opaque panel, and the
   audit footer. Applies to 14 screens across the two apps.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 27.8 (record detail), 27.13 (tabs),
   chapter 23 (the record hero with the stages in it) and 24.6 (the band).

     ch27.8, the region order, verbatim:
       "Breadcrumb, then the identity row — record number in the charcoal
        pill, status, relation, since — then the title on its own line, then
        tags beneath it. Keys sit above because they tell you which record
        this is before you read what it's called; tags sit below because they
        describe it afterwards. Facts strip, the record's own text,
        attachments, then the ink footer. That order never changes."

     THE IDENTITY ROW MOVES BELOW THE TITLE, AND THE BREADCRUMB ABOVE A RECORD
     IS GONE — OVERRIDE 73 (2026-08-26), REVERSING THE QUOTE JUST ABOVE.
     The client, comparing the live "Tickets · Padelbase · 4182" record page
     against a reference mockup, verbatim: "notice how the chips are directly
     underneath the title. in the example that I put, there is no edit button
     like yours, but the edit button should be aligned with the title and the
     chips underneath it. also, detail pages do not need this bar that you
     have on top where we have Padelbase and the number. these are chips, so
     the black chip is always the ID. we always use black chips for IDs, and
     next to it, add a chip for Padelbase like in the example. of course,
     translate this to universal rules."
     This reverses the ch27.8 sentence quoted above on two points at once:
     (1) "Breadcrumb, then the identity row" — there is no breadcrumb on a
     record screen any more, in any spelling; (2) "the identity row … then
     the title … then tags beneath it" and its own stated reason, "Keys sit
     above because they tell you which record this is before you read what
     it's called" — the client's ruling puts the identity row BELOW the
     title instead, so this file no longer agrees with either the order or
     the reasoning. WHAT CHANGED, CONCRETELY: `breadcrumb`/`breadcrumbLabel`
     are removed from this component's API rather than kept unused — a grep
     of every real caller (`DetailScreen`, the sole production consumer of
     this shape) showed it never forwards a breadcrumb into `RecordChrome`
     at all, so the prop was already dead outside one demo catalogue
     specimen (`demo/shapes/screens-1-4.tsx`), which is not a caller this
     ruling needs to keep serving. The identity row — the black ID badge,
     ch27.8's own pill, now leading a NEW `collectionLabel` chip ("Padelbase
     like in the example") and then the pre-existing `chips` — moves from
     `eyebrow` (above the title) to the line directly under it. `actions`
     moves into the title's own row: `RecordDetail` already threads `title`
     and `actions` into the same `Title` row (baseline-aligned, actions
     pushed `ms-auto`), so handing this file's `title` and `actions` straight
     to it, with no `eyebrow` content above them any more, is what puts Edit
     "aligned with the title" with no extra markup here — this file still
     draws nothing of its own. `tags` is UNCHANGED and keeps its own line
     below the new chip row: the client ruled on the chip row and the
     breadcrumb, not on tags, and a tag ("Mail", "Retainer") is a topic label
     while a chip here is identity/status — different meanings, so they stay
     two rows rather than merging into one.
     A DEEPER FINDING THIS RULING SURFACED, NOT FIXED IN THIS FILE: the live
     Tickets/Padelbase page does not reach this component's identity row and
     title in the same place at all. It renders through `RecordRoute` →
     `DetailScreen` → `RecordChrome`, and `DetailScreen` draws its OWN
     breadcrumb + eyebrow + title in `ScreenShell`'s header band, entirely
     apart from this file's identity row in the body pane below — that split
     is what actually produced the client's screenshot, not this file's own
     internal ordering, which was already breadcrumb-then-identity-then-
     title-then-tags, adjacent, before this override. `RecordRoute` is fixed
     by composing `ScreenShell` and this shape directly instead of
     `DetailScreen`, so the live specimen now gets this ruling. `DetailScreen`
     itself — and its other callers, `mini-app/record.tsx`,
     `compositions/states/new-empty-record.tsx`,
     `compositions/screens/company-hub.tsx` and the `demo/shapes/
     templates-0.tsx` catalogue — still draw the pre-ruling split and are
     OUT OF SCOPE here: `detail-screen.tsx` was not one of the two files this
     pass owned, and one of its four callers was under concurrent edit.
     Logged in KWAPSO-SPEC.md's override register (row 73) rather than
     guessed at.

     THERE IS NO FACTS STRIP — 26.04 BEATS 27.8, OVERRIDE 49 (2026-08-23).
     26.04, verbatim: "There is no facts strip — a record's values belong in
     its body, not stacked above the tabs." 27.8 says the opposite twice: the
     order above names a strip as a region, and its own next paragraph says
     "No side rail of metadata. The facts strip does that job ACROSS THE TOP."
     26.04 wins because 26.04 IS THE DETAIL-PAGE TYPE — it is the entry that
     defines what this screen is, and the same sentence carries the papers law
     ("the page itself is off-beige and every panel on it is soft paper") that
     the K1 reversal already took as binding. A chapter cannot be the
     authority on the page's grounds and the stale side on the page's regions
     in the same breath.
     WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THIS FILE, AND IT IS A PROHIBITION, NOT A DELETION:
     there is no `facts` slot here and there must not be one. `hero` is the
     only node above the strip and it is chapter 23's stage progression; a
     route that puts a record's VALUES there is drawing the region 26.04
     forbids. Values go in `panel` — the body — where `system/t.tsx` and
     `screens/new-empty-record.tsx` already put them.
     Logged as an ARTIFACT CORRECTION OWED against 27.8.

     ch27.13, which tab shape a record takes, verbatim:
       "A record's sections — Overview, Activity, Files — use the underline
        strip with a quiet count, never the folder shape. Folder tabs belong
        to collections and main screens only; inside a record they would claim
        the page is a different collection."

     ch27.8 on what a record page is FOR, verbatim: "The detail screen is for
       reading … Everything that changes the record happens in the slide-in
       from 27.3, so this page never contains a form."

     ch27.8 on the last region, verbatim, and it is the whole of region 4:
       "Every detail page ends with the charcoal #1A1918 card from the kit's
        record pattern: Latest activity on the left — a short reverse-
        chronological feed with an add-a-note field — and Record on the right,
        two to four key/value rows."

     ch27.8 on what the PORTAL door does with that card, verbatim:
       "the portal never shows internal notes, only what was said to the
        client."

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · IT DRAWS NOTHING. `RecordDetail` already renders the four regions, the
     transparent band, the sticky strip, the opaque panel and the ink footer
     card. This file arranges product content into them and writes not one
     class that is not layout for its own two wrappers.
   · NO FORM ON THIS SCREEN. There is no field slot and no save state, by
     ch27.8. Editing is `FormScreen surface="panel"`, a layer over this one.
     The footer's add-a-note field is not an exception to that: it appends to
     a log and edits no value on the page, and ch27.8 draws it itself.
   · THE PORTAL SHOWS NO INTERNAL NOTE. `onAddNote` on `door="portal"` warns
     in development, beside the stage-count check and for the same reason —
     both are leaks of the operations side into a client's page.
   · THE TAB STRIP IS THE UNDERLINE STRIP, AND IT IS NOW THE ONLY ONE. Ruling
     E of 2026-08-22 ("folder tabs are for main screens, line tabs for detail
     screens") made a record STATE its shape, because `CollectionFrame`
     defaulted to the other one. The client retired the folder tab variant
     entirely on 2026-09-02 — "the only tabs that we will have are the line
     tabs because folders will only be used for the breadcrumbs" — so
     `RecordDetail` states nothing and cannot draw anything else. CH27.13 is
     vindicated a second time and CH24.3's folder tabs on a record are twice
     stale. SHP-3 in GAPS-SHAPES.md and REC-1 in GAPS-COL3.md stay settled;
     see GAPS-RULINGS.md.
   · THE PORTAL SHOWS THREE STAGES, NOT SEVEN (ruling 04). `door="portal"`
     says so in development rather than silently drawing seven to a client.
   · A REGION THE READER MAY NOT SEE RENDERS NOTHING. `actionsVisible`,
     `stagesVisible`, `panelVisible` and `auditVisible` are `RecordDetail`'s
     own props and they render `null`, not a lock and not a dimmed panel
     (ch24.6). This file does not reinvent them.
   · Focus is one global rule. No radius, no colour, no size decided here.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. This module builds the identity-row node during its own
   render and forwards a tab-change handler into Radix Tabs.

 *                      A whole-page failure is a different screen (ch27.19).
 *  9. selected       — the active tab and the current stage; both owned below.
 * 10. read-only      — the normal case. ch27.8: every value here is text, not a
 *                      field, so there is no editable state to leave.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — the measure changes with `density` and nothing
 *  else. ch27.8: "No side rail of metadata … the reading column stays single",
 *  so there is nothing to restack. The strip scrolls rather than wraps, which
 *  is `Tabs`' own behaviour.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling. Logical properties throughout.
