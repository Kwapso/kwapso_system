/* ============================================================================
   SearchResults — one search's answer: facets, sort, results grouped by kind,
   the exact total, and pages. The body chapter 27.40 pages, in either door.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 27.40 (find), chapter 19 (the one toolbar
   contract), 27.21 (empty) and 27.22 (no results).

     ch27.40 on what it is, verbatim:
       "Search across everything, opened from anywhere with one key. It is the
        palette from chapter 12 grown up: the same overlay, now paging real
        results from every kind of thing in the system. There is no find page
        to navigate to — that is the point."

     ch27.40 on paging, verbatim:
       "Eight results a page, counted — '1–8 of 214'. A person looking for one
        thing needs to know how much is left, and an infinite list can never
        tell them."

     ch27.40 on grouping, verbatim:
       "Records first, then files and words. The groups are fixed so the shape
        of the answer is the same every time, and a kind with no hits is left
        out rather than shown empty."

     ch27.40 on the keyboard, verbatim: "Opened with a key, moved with arrows,
       opened with return, paged with the right arrow. The mouse works, but
       the hints stay visible — this is the one place the kit teaches
       shortcuts."

     ch27.40, doors differ, verbatim: "The portal searches its own three kinds
       only — its requests, its deliverables and its own messages. It never
       returns an internal record, and the empty state says so in words rather
       than returning nothing."

     ch19, the toolbar contract, verbatim: "Every view carries the same
       contract: search, filters, three actions, view switch. Only the body
       below the toolbar changes."

   THIS IS A BODY, NOT A PAGE — AND THAT IS 27.40's OWN RULE
   The kit says in as many words that there is no find PAGE, and ch27 law 1
   forbids a screen inventing a second spine. So this shape draws no rail, no
   header band and no dialog: it is the region an overlay pages, and the same
   region a route can drop into a `CollectionFrame` body. It has one column
   and it never splits. Recorded as SR-1 in GAPS-SHAPES2.md.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · A KIND WITH NO HITS IS LEFT OUT. Structural, not a call-site courtesy:
     `visibleGroups` drops every group with no results before anything is
     drawn, so an empty band cannot be rendered at all.
   · THE COUNT IS EXACT, AND IT IS NOT A `Badge`. `Badge` abbreviates (1.3k,
     2m+) and renders nothing for zero, which is right for a live collection
     count and wrong here: 27.40 states "1–8 of 214" and a reader deciding
     whether to type another word needs the real number. The range line is
     tabular text. SR-2 in GAPS-SHAPES2.md.
   · EMPTY IS NOT NO-RESULTS. `filtered` is computed from what is switched on
     — a term in the field or a chip in the bar — and it chooses between
     ch27.21's register and ch27.22's. ch27.22 forbids mango on that screen.
   · LOADING KEEPS THE ROW SHAPE. ch27.6 wants the same row heights as the
     loaded state, so the loading body is a `List` in its own loading state at
     the page size, never a spinner and never a generic busy register.
   · THE HINTS ARE A PROMISE, SO THEY HAVE NO DEFAULT. `search-input.tsx`
     already ruled this for its own shortcut chip: "the chip is a promise
     about a keyboard shortcut, and a component cannot know whether the app
     kept it." This shape binds no keys — `Command` owns them — so it will not
     print "↑↓ move" on a surface that may not answer an arrow.
   · THE PORTAL SEARCHES THREE KINDS. `door="portal"` says so in development
     rather than quietly returning an internal kind to a client.
   · Focus is one global rule. No ring, no radius, no fill written here.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. Search, facets, sort and paging all build handlers during
   this module's own render.

 * A search's answer.

 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — toolbar, then a band per kind, then the range and the
 *                      pager.
 *  2. hover          — the row wash, owned by `List`.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *  4. active/pressed — not drawn for a hit: opening one navigates, and the
 *                      acknowledgement is the destination (GAPS-COL3 LST-4).
 *                      The pager's controls take the kit's own nudge.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply to the region. A reader who may not open
 *                      a kind is not returned that kind, which is ch24.6's
 *                      rule and happens above this component.
 *  6. loading        — one `List` at the page size in ITS loading state, so
 *                      the rows do not jump when the answer lands. The field
 *                      stays editable and takes `searching` instead.
 *  7. empty          — nothing typed yet: ch27.21's register, "Search across
 *                      everything". No mango — there is nothing to create.
 *  8. error          — ruling 06's block failure, with the retry.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. A hit is a link, not a choice.
 * 10. read-only      — always. A search result is never editable.
 *
 * NO-RESULTS IS A NINTH THING, AND IT IS NOT STATE 7. ch27.22: "It is a
 * different screen from 27.21 and must never be mistaken for it." `filtered`
 * routes to it, and it carries a way back rather than a create.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile   — 27.40's own narrow render: "the overlay becomes the screen".
 *             The toolbar WRAPS rather than dropping a control (ch27.1: "The
 *             toolbar is never dropped — it condenses"), the range line and
 *             the hints wrap onto their own lines, and the page strip drops
 *             to one line of arrows and numbers — `PaginationContent`'s own
 *             answer, not one added here.
 *  tablet   — unchanged.
 *  desktop  — unchanged in structure; `density` sets the measure.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling. Logical properties throughout.
