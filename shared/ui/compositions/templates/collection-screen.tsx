/* ============================================================================
   CollectionScreen — heading, exact count, tabs, filters, search, sort, rows,
   "load more" and empty. The most-visited screen in either door.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 27.1 (collection page), chapter 19 (the one
   toolbar contract), 27.13 (tabs), 27.21 (empty) and 27.22 (no results).

     ch27.1, the region order, verbatim:
       "Figures, folder tabs, then the collection panel — toolbar, rows, pager
        inside it. A collection may drop the figure strip; it may not reorder
        what remains, and filters never sit above the tabs."

     ch19, the toolbar contract, verbatim:
       "Every view carries the same contract: search, filters, three actions,
        view switch. Only the body below the toolbar changes."

     ch27.21 on the count, verbatim: "Zeros are shown, not hidden. A blank
       strip looks broken; a zero in disabled ink says the count is real and
       the collection is simply new."

     ch27.22, why empty and no-results are two screens, verbatim: "Empty
       (27.21) offers a create button; no-results offers a way back. Showing
       'Add a record' to someone whose filter is too narrow makes them create
       a duplicate of something they already have."

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   CLIENT FEEDBACK, ROUND 1 — THE TWO THINGS THE TOOLBAR WAS MISSING
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   ITEM 4, verbatim: "you missed a full section of the toolbar which is the
   view selector! review the screenshot from the claude design! its explained
   there! 1 search 2 filters 3 views 4 buttons".

   True, and the miss was total. `CollectionFrame` has carried a `viewSwitch`
   slot from the start and CH19's contract has been quoted in three files, but
   NO CONTROL was ever drawn for it and no route in either door passed one.
   Zone 3 was a hole with a name. `ViewSwitch` is the control the chapter
   draws — a paper caret pill, not a segmented control — and `views` / `view`
   / `onViewChange` are how a route reaches it. Which bodies a collection
   offers is per-collection data (CH27.28), so nothing is defaulted here.

   HOW THE CHOSEN VIEW PERSISTS IS RULED — and this shape still stores
   nothing. CH27's own fifth owed rule, OPEN.md §C21 item 5, decision D7-5.
   Client, 2026-08-24: *"no. this is individual"*. Remembered, per person;
   first run table-first; register row 69. `view` stays CONTROLLED because the
   kit owns neither the user nor the storage policy — the application reads
   the person's stored view in and writes it back out. See the `view` prop.

   ITEM 3, verbatim: "everytime i see a collection, on the toolbar, at least i
   need to have the + button (yes, on every view unless specifically
   specified)."

   So zone 4's charcoal `+` is now the DEFAULT and `toolbarCreate={false}` is
   the opt-out the client's own parenthesis grants. Before this, the `+` was
   opt-in through `toolbarActions` and NO route in either door opted in — so
   the panel's create existed on two screens in the whole build, and below
   `sm`, where `MainScreen` hides the header band's actions, a collection had
   no create control at all. The pair rule is untouched: this one is
   `variant="inverse"`, charcoal, and 27.22's "The page-level mango + stays in
   the header where it always is" is still true because the header's control
   is not touched here.

   IT IS A MAIN SCREEN, AND SINCE 2026-08-23 IT SAYS SO IN CODE
   `SHELL.md`, the merged law: "a main screen is in the navbar; a detail
   screen has breadcrumbs." A collection is in the navbar, so this shape is
   the kit's main screen with a table or a list for a body — and it now
   RENDERS `MainScreen` rather than assembling chrome of its own.

   What that fixed, all of it read off `SHELL.md`'s own list of errors:

     · THE OFF-BEIGE BODY PANE. This file used to return a bare `div` with a
       measure on it and put `CollectionFrame` straight into the document. The
       page, the screen card, the rail and the body pane were all missing, so
       a soft-paper panel stood on whatever the document happened to be. Four
       levels now, drawn once, in `screen-shell.tsx`.
     · THE FIGURE STRIP LIES BARE. It is on the body pane, not in cards. The
       dashboard (27.11) is the one exception the kit names.
     · NO FOOTER. `MainScreen` has no footer slot at all, so this shape cannot
       grow one by accident. The paragraph below about CH27.8 was already the
       right answer and is now enforced by the type.
     · ONE MANGO, AND IT IS A GLYPH. The header band's `+` comes from
       `onCreate` and is unlabelled — "Create is always the glyph, never the
       word". Routes used to pass a labelled `New role` / `New ticket` button
       into `actions`, which put a WORD on the create and a mango inside the
       toolbar instead of the header band. `actions` is now the header band's
       paper pills (Export and its neighbours); the panel's own charcoal `+`
       is drawn from `onToolbarCreate` and `toolbarActions` carries only the
       panel's paper pills beside it.
     · THE TOOLBAR IS INSIDE THE PANEL. It always was — `CollectionFrame`
       draws it as the panel's first row — and it stays there.

   THE EYEBROW CARRIES THE COUNT. `SHELL.md`: a main screen's eyebrow is
   `GROUP · 24 RECORDS`, the scope then the count. The count used to ride
   beside the heading as a `Badge` chip inside the frame; it is the same
   number, in the place the kit draws it, and `countLabel` is the word after
   it. A zero renders as nothing at all rather than "0", which is both
   `SHELL.md`'s sentence and what `Badge` already did.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · THE ORDER IS NOT THE CALL SITE'S. `CollectionFrame` fixes heading →
     figures → tabs → toolbar → body, and the toolbar fixes search → filters →
     period → view switch → actions. This file passes nodes into those slots
     and cannot reorder them, which is exactly why it uses the frame instead
     of a div. The `period` slot is override 28's (2026-08-23): CH27.26 draws
     `‹ 6 weeks ›` inside the toolbar, so the LIST of slots grew by one while
     the ORDER stayed the frame's. It is forwarded here rather than left
     unreachable, because the override's own words forbid the alternative — a
     call site "smuggling a control into `filters`".
   · THERE IS ONE TAB SHAPE AND THIS FILE STATES NOTHING ABOUT IT. Under
     ruling E of 2026-08-22 ("folder tabs are for main screens, line tabs for
     detail screens") a collection was a main screen and this file wrote
     `tabsVariant="folder"` rather than leaning on `CollectionFrame`'s
     default, so the ruling would be legible in the file it governed. The
     client retired the folder tab variant on 2026-09-02 — "the only tabs that
     we will have are the line tabs because folders will only be used for the
     breadcrumbs" — so there is no shape to choose, no prop to pass and
     nothing for a reader to have to look up. CH27.1's "figures, folder tabs,
     then the collection panel" and CH27.13's "folder tabs belong to
     collections and main screens only" are both stale by one word; their
     ORDER is not, and the frame still enforces it.
   · THERE IS NO INK FOOTER ON THIS SHAPE, AND THAT IS NOT AN OMISSION.
     CH27.8's charcoal two-column card ends a RECORD detail page — "every
     detail page ends with the charcoal card … it appears once per record". A
     collection is not a record and has no Latest activity and no Record block
     of its own; what ends a collection is its pager. Stated here because the
     DEF-1 sweep of 2026-08-23 walked every file that names `RecordChrome`,
     and this one names it only to point at the other half of ruling E.
   · EMPTY IS NOT NO-RESULTS. `filtered` is computed from what is actually
     switched on — a term in the field or a chip in the bar — and it changes
     both the register and the action. ch27.22 forbids mango on that screen.
   · LOADING KEEPS THE ROW SHAPE. ch27.6 wants "same column widths, same row
     heights as the loaded state", so the loading body is the SAME table or
     list in its own loading state, not a generic busy register.
   · THE COUNT IS EXACT AND A ZERO IS DRAWN. `count={0}` renders a quiet zero.
   · Focus is one global rule. Nothing here draws a ring, a radius or a fill.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. Search, sort, filters and paging all create handlers during
   this module's own render.

   * control at all. Making this the default is what puts one back at every

           toolbar is a single row; `FilterBar`'s own default lets its chip row
           WRAP from `sm` up, and a slot that grows downwards inside a row
           makes the row grow downwards. Measured before the change, on
           `CollectionFrame`'s own specimens: three chips plus the add slot and
           clear came to 472px of intrinsic width against a 699px toolbar at
           834, which is what turned the typical toolbar into two rows on an
           iPad and four on a phone.

           `"line"` is `FilterBar`'s existing mobile shape — the one-line
           horizontal scroller its header reasons out at length — simply held
           at every width instead of released at `sm`. Nothing is hidden and
           nothing is renamed: every chip and every remove control stays
           visible by a swipe and in the tab order.

           The default is untouched, so `filter-builder`, `archive`,
           `search-results` and `no-results` — none of which sits in a one-row

     the answer to D7-5 rather than a gap in it: the choice is remembered per
     person, by the application, because the kit owns no user and no store.

     Sort is not one of ch19's four toolbar slots. It sits where the view
     switcher sits, which ch27.13 already rules is the home of "the view
     switcher and the sub-tab picker" — level-3 controls inside the toolbar.
