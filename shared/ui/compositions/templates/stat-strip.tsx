   StatStrip — the headline numbers, each with an optional mini chart. A panel
   the reader has no right to renders NOTHING: not a placeholder, not a lock.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 27.1 (the figure strip on a collection),
   27.11 (the dashboard) and 24.6 (permissions).

     ch27.1 on how many figures, verbatim:
       "Three or four counts a person would act on. The strip is not an
        analytics surface — a fifth number belongs on the dashboard."

     ch27.11 on what a figure is for, verbatim:
       "A figure or a card is a link to the collection that produced it,
        filtered the same way. A dashboard that cannot be opened into its
        records is a poster."

     ch27.11 on series colour, verbatim:
       "Series take sky, forest and poppy in that order and cycle. Mango is
        the brand, not a data colour, and grey reads as disabled. A fourth
        series waits for a fourth accent that carries charcoal type at both
        its values."

     ch24.6 on rights, verbatim: "Permissions HIDE actions rather than
       disabling them, so a client never sees a button they can't press."

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · THE PERMISSION RULE IS ALREADY BUILT. `StatGrid` renders `null` for
     `visible: false` on a tile and for `visible={false}` on the whole grid.
     This file passes the flag through and reinvents nothing — no lock glyph,
     no dimmed tile, no "you don't have access" placeholder.
   · NEVER MORE THAN THREE SERIES. `--chart-4` and `--chart-5` repeat 1 and 2
     today, so a four-series chart shows two indistinguishable pairs. A spark
     with more than three series is cut to three and says so in development.
     Logged as SHP-8 in GAPS-SHAPES.md.
   · A FIFTH FIGURE IS A DASHBOARD. Over `maxFigures` the strip still draws
     every figure it was handed — dropping a number silently would be worse
     than a crowded strip — and warns in development.
   · A FIGURE IS A LINK. `onSelect` is the route through to the records
     behind it, and `StatGrid` makes the whole tile the control.

   · A FIGURE IS BODY, NOT FRAME — SO THE STRIP OWNS ALL FOUR REGISTERS, AND
     THE CALL SITE PASSES ITS STATE VERBATIM. ch27 law 4 keeps the rail, the
     header and the tabs drawn through a state change; a NUMBER is not any of
     those. A strip that survives its own screen's state is a strip asserting
     figures that came out of the request which just failed, or which has not
     answered yet. Three routes had each decided this separately and arrived
     at three different answers (T3B-6/7/8 in GAPS-TRACK3B.md), so the whole
     decision now lives HERE and nowhere else:

       ready    the figures.
       loading  every tile UNFILLED — see the next clause.
       empty    the register, `statStrip`'s own words.
       error    the register, ruling 06's block sentence.

     A route must pass `state={state}` with no ternary in it. Passing a
     doctored state is how the three drifted, and any conditional at a call
     site is now a bug in that call site rather than a local choice.

   · WHATEVER BLANKS THE VALUE BLANKS EVERY OTHER ASSERTION ON THE TILE. This
     is the clause the three routes broke in the same way. `StatGrid` draws a
     `Skeleton` where an unarrived VALUE goes, but it knows nothing about the
     support line, the delta or the spark's accessible description — so a
     loading strip was hiding "76%" and then printing "Retainer use rose from
     sixty-four to seventy-six per cent" two lines below it, and hiding "142"
     while its spark still read "Hours logged per week: 118, 126, 133, 142".
     A number withheld in one channel and published in the next is worse than
     either, because only one of them is marked as unreliable. While a tile is
     busy this file therefore blanks `value` (`StatGrid`'s job), `support`,
     `delta` and `deltaDirection`, and hands the spark `loading` with NO
     `summary`. ch27.6 wants "the destination screen with its body unfilled",
     not a shorter screen, so the support line becomes a `Skeleton` of its own
     rather than being dropped — the tile keeps its height and the strip does
     not jump when the figures land. `Chart loading` does the same for the
     spark, at exactly the plot's height.

   · Focus is one global rule. No fill, no radius and no size decided here.

   WHAT THE ARTIFACT DOES NOT SAY
   The artifact draws no figure strip in a failed register anywhere — every
   drawn strip in ch27.1, 27.11 and 27.43 is a strip with its numbers in it.
   So the error register above is NOT transcribed from a drawing; it is ruling
   06's "a failed block says 'we can't show this right now'" applied to a
   block, which is the register this shape has drawn since it was written.
   Nothing new was invented for the fix — the suppression in front of it was
   removed.

   Removing it then exposed the real question, which was T3B-6: the strip and
   the collection below it fail together, so ONE failure printed ruling 06's
   sentence twice, stacked. Ruled 2026-08-23: a failed strip draws nothing,
   and `errorRegister` opts a standalone strip back in. That follows the
   artifact — which draws no strip in a failed state at all — rather than
   inventing a second register for it.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. The spark charts are recharts, and this module builds the
   select handlers during its own render.

 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.

 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. A figure the reader may not see is
 *                      ABSENT (`visible: false`), never dimmed — ch24.6.
 *  6. loading        — per-tile `loading`, or `state="loading"` for the strip.
 *                      A value that has not arrived renders nothing, not "0",
 *                      and NOTHING ELSE ON THE TILE ASSERTS IT EITHER: the

 *                      register on every route — this is not a per-route
 *                      decision.
 *  8. error          — `state="error"`: the figures go, because they came out
 *                      of the request that just failed, and by default the
 *                      strip then draws NOTHING — the body below it carries
 *                      the failure, and two blocks saying "we can't show this
 *                      right now" one above the other is worse than one.
 *                      `errorRegister` opts a standalone strip back in to
 *                      ruling 06's sentence. T3B-6.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. A figure is a link, not a choice; the
 *                      selection lands on the collection it opens.
 * 10. read-only      — the normal case. A figure is never editable.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — the grid rewraps on `minTileWidth` and nothing
 *  else changes. ch27.11: "on narrow the figures go two-up", which is what an
 *  auto-fit grid does at the default tile width.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling. Nothing here is directional.
