   ScreenShell — the four levels every screen in both doors sits on.

   WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, AND WHY IT IS A SHAPE

   The client, 2026-08-23, on what the build kept getting wrong: "where I see
   you miss a lot is in the things that have a container and the ones that lay
   in the background directly."

   ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   COLLAPSED 2026-09-02, CLIENT-APPROVED. THERE ARE NO LONGER THREE SCREEN
   TEMPLATES. THERE IS THIS ONE, AND FOUR SLOTS THAT VARY.
   ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   The client, verbatim: "Let's completely get rid of these three variations.
   Let's just do one shell, and then let's just explain that there are
   variations for the title if it's main screen with no parents or not. Also,
   just define which pages have a footer."

   SHE ASKED FOR IT VALIDATED RATHER THAN AGREED WITH, AND THE KIT ALREADY
   AGREED IN WRITING. `detail-screen.tsx`'s own header, before this change:
   "THE SHELL AND THE RAIL ARE IDENTICAL TO A MAIN SCREEN'S. Neither file
   draws either one: `ScreenShell` does, once, and both hand it the same
   rail." `main-screen.tsx` carried the identical sentence with the two names
   swapped, and reason 1 below quotes `SHELL.md` saying it a third time. Two
   templates whose headers each said they differed from the other in three
   named places, and whose code then made the same `<ScreenShell>` call twice
   with a different `header` node, were two spellings of one screen.

   SO `MainScreen` AND `DetailScreen` STOP BEING TEMPLATES. Everything either
   of them decided is decided here now, once, and every ruling either header
   carried has been MOVED into this file rather than summarised — the mango
   argument, the glyph rule, override 73's identity order, the bare figure
   strip, the narrow "controls, never counts" rule and the footer's home are
   all below, in their own sections. The two exports survive as thin
   adapters over this shell and hold no design of their own; see WHAT SURVIVES
   AS AN ADAPTER, AND WHY, at the end of this block.

   THE FOUR SLOTS, AND WHAT EACH ONE WAS BEFORE

     1 TITLE STEP  · DERIVED, NEVER PASSED. Big when the screen has no parent,
                     one rung smaller when it has one. The BREADCRUMB decides
                     it: a one-tab trail is a top-level location. See
                     `breadcrumbDepth` and TITLE_STEP_CHILD below. No call
                     site anywhere can name a type step — which is the folder's
                     own law ("not one file in this folder writes a fill, a
                     radius, a ring or a type step") kept rather than broken.
     2 IDENTITY    · `recordNumber` · `collectionLabel` · `chips`, in that
                     order, on the line DIRECTLY UNDER the title. Override 73.
                     A collection passes none and no row is drawn.
     3 FIGURES     · `figures`, bare on the body pane, above everything else
                     in the card. A record has no equivalent. This is the
                     FOURTH VARIABLE and neither the client's list nor
                     `SHELL.md`'s table names it — see its own section.
     4 FOOTER      · `footer`. Declared per screen, never inferred. The
                     client's own instruction is "just define which pages have
                     a footer", so it is a slot you can grep for and not a
                     consequence of some other prop being set.

   WHAT HAPPENED TO `SHELL.md`'s THREE, ONE AT A TIME

     · IDENTITY — slot 2, unchanged in substance. `SHELL.md` phrased
       difference 1 as the EYEBROW (`GROUP · 24 RECORDS` on a collection,
       `COLLECTION · 4182` on a record). Override 73 (2026-08-26) already
       killed the record half of that: the client, verbatim, "detail pages do
       not need this bar that you have on top where we have Padelbase and the
       number. these are chips, so the black chip is always the ID." So the
       eyebrow survives as a COLLECTION-ONLY slot and the record's half of it
       is the identity row, under the title. Both are here now, and the ORDER
       is enforced in code rather than asked for in prose — the shell wraps
       `recordNumber` in the charcoal `Badge variant="inverse"` itself, which
       is what "we always use black chips for IDs" means when it is a rule and
       not a hope.
     · TABS — SPENT, AND NOT BY THIS CHANGE. `SHELL.md`'s difference 2 read
       "folder tabs on a main screen, underline on a detail screen". The
       client retired the folder tab VARIANT the same day (v1.2.28): there is
       one tab shape now and the folder silhouette belongs to the breadcrumb.
       So the two screens no longer differ on tabs at all, and this shell
       draws no tab strip of either kind — a collection's subsets are
       `CollectionFrame`'s, a record's sub-views are `RecordDetail`'s, and
       neither is a level of the shell. Nothing in this file touches tabs.
     · MANGO — slot 4 plus `actions`. `SHELL.md`'s difference 3 was "the `+`
       on a main screen, `Edit` on a detail screen, and the footer". The two
       controls were never two mechanisms: both are THE SCREEN'S ONE MANGO,
       both stand at the inline end of the title's row, and both drop below
       the narrow breakpoint. They arrive through one `actions` slot now. The
       footer is slot 4. See THE ONE MANGO below for the whole argument, moved
       here verbatim from `main-screen.tsx`.

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   THE TITLE STEP, AND WHY THE BREADCRUMB DECIDES IT
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The client: "there are variations for the title if it's main screen with no
   parents or not." A screen with no parent is a screen whose trail is one
   tab; a record's trail is its collection and then itself. So the trail's
   LENGTH is the whole of the rule, and it is a fact the caller already holds
   — it is the array it hands the breadcrumb strip.

       depth 1 · no parent      the door's own step   comfortable h2 · calm h3
       depth 2+ · has a parent  one rung down         comfortable h3 · calm h4

   THE ROOT STEP IS NOT A SECOND SOURCE. `SHAPE_HEADING_SIZE` is imported and
   used unchanged, so the door's step stays the one number `ScreenRenderer`,
   `CollectionFrame` and `RecordChrome` all already agree on; the only new
   thing in this file is the one rung DOWN for a nested screen.

   WHY IT IS A DEPTH AND NOT A SIZE, AND NOT A READ OF THE NODE. The slot is a
   plain node (see `breadcrumb`), and this file will not inspect it: its own
   rule three paragraphs down is that "a shell that inspected its children to
   police them would be guessing at element types across a `React.Fragment`
   and would be wrong the first time somebody wrapped their trail in a
   provider." Counting `<li>`s in CSS would be the same guess wearing a
   selector, and it could not reach `Title`'s `size` prop anyway without this
   file writing a type step by hand. So the caller states the trail's length —
   a fact about navigation, which is the caller's — and the shell owns the
   mapping from that length to a step, which is typography and is not.
   `breadcrumbDepth` DEFAULTS TO 1, so a screen that says nothing is a
   top-level screen with the big title, which is the honest default: a screen
   with no trail has no parent.

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   THE ONE MANGO — MOVED HERE FROM `main-screen.tsx`, UNABRIDGED
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   `SHELL.md`: the page header's `+` is MANGO; the collection panel's own `+`
   is CHARCOAL; only one mango in the pair. The header's is the shell's, from
   `onCreate`. The panel's belongs to the toolbar and is `CollectionFrame`'s.

   THE HEADER'S `+` STAYS MANGO ON THE MANGO SPINE. EXAMINED, NOT ASSUMED.
   On 2026-08-24 the client made MANGO the default spine, and 26.02's mango
   card says "One per workspace, never combined with a mango header." Read as
   covering this control, that sentence would take the mango `+` off every
   collection in the system. It does not, for four reasons, and the fourth is
   the one that settles it:

     1. IT SAYS "HEADER", NOT "ACTION". The header band is off-beige (client
        ruling, below). A mango control standing in an off-beige band is not a
        mango header. The kit draws NO mango header band anywhere — the only
        three mango REGIONS in the whole artifact are 26.02's own spine
        specimen, an unsaved-changes save bar and the rail's active row.
     2. OVERRIDE 17 COUNTS MANGO **ACTIONS**, and the mango spine improves
        that count rather than breaking it. The spine is a ground, not a
        control, and on it the lit row inverts to charcoal — so the rail
        spends ZERO mango actions and this `+` is the screen's one. Under the
        ink or paper spine the same screen carries two. Stepping the `+` down as well
        would leave the screen with NO primary action at all.
     3. 27.22's RULE CARD, verbatim: "No mango on this screen at all …
        **The page-level mango + stays in the header where it always is.**"
     4. 26.02's OWN CLOSING PROSE, verbatim, and it is an exhaustive list:
        "**The rest of the app does not change with the spine**: the page
        stays off-beige, cards stay soft paper, and the active row is mango
        on the ink and paper spines, charcoal on the mango one." The active
        row is the ONLY thing the chapter says varies. A header control that
        changed colour with the spine would make that sentence false.

   SO WHAT DOES "NEVER COMBINED WITH A MANGO HEADER" BIND? A second mango
   CHROME REGION, which is the same kind of thing the spine is. It has one
   live case in this repo and this file enforces it: the mango ambient FIELD
   is dropped on the mango spine. See `ambient`.

   THE ONE THING THIS DOES NOT SETTLE is whether a 40px mango circle still
   READS as the screen's one action when the whole window behind it is mango.
   That is a judgement about the whole screen, not a rule the artifact states,
   so it is measured and put to the client rather than taken here.
   `SHELL.md`'s *Owed* carries it.

   "Create is always the glyph, never the word" (26.01) — so `onCreate` draws
   `size="icon"` with a `+` in it and an `aria-label`, never a labelled button.
   The kit names exactly one exception (27.21's `+ Add the first`) and it is
   not a screen header's.

   `Edit` IS THE ONE LABELLED EXCEPTION, AND IT IS NOT AN EXCEPTION TO THE
   CREATE RULE. 26.01, verbatim: "Create is always the glyph, never the word …
   A lone Edit follows the same rule with the pencil." So `onEdit` draws the
   pencil AND the word, which is what both 26.04 and 27.39 draw (`✎ Edit`),
   and the create rule is untouched because Edit is not a create.

   A SCREEN GETS ONE OR THE OTHER, NEVER BOTH, and that is checked rather than
   trusted: passing `onCreate` and `onEdit` together is two mangos, which
   ruling 26 forbids, so the shell drops `onEdit` and warns in development.
   NO MANGO AT ALL ON SOME SCREENS — `SHELL.md`: "on Archive, Activity log and
   Link sent there is no mango at all." Those routes pass neither handler and
   no control is drawn, not a disabled one, which ch24.6 forbids.

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   THE FOURTH VARIABLE — THE FIGURE STRIP. CONFIRMED, AND IT IS REAL.
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   `SHELL.md`'s table has six rows and none of them is the figures; the
   client's own list of what varies has four items and none of them is the
   figures either. The table is still not wrong, and the reason is worth
   writing down because it is why nobody counted it: a detail screen has no
   figure strip *and has nothing in that place at all*. `SHELL.md` compares
   what the two screens each draw in a shared region; the figures are a region
   ONE of them simply does not have, so there was no cell to fill in. That is
   an absence, not a difference — the same way the table has no row for the
   stage progression, which `record-chrome.tsx` already argues in exactly
   those words ("a main screen has no record and therefore no progression, so
   there is nothing here for the table in `SHELL.md` to compare").

   HOW IT IS HANDLED: as a slot like the other three, and as DATA rather than
   a node, because the LAW about it is the shell's and not a route's.
   `SHELL.md`: "the figure strip on a main screen — bare on the body pane, NOT
   in cards … the one exception is the dashboard (27.11), where the figures
   ARE in cards." A route handed a bare slot would have to remember
   `surface="bare"` forty times. It is passed here, once, and `figuresSurface`
   is the dashboard's one legal escape. This is `main-screen.tsx`'s own
   argument and its own wiring, moved up one level and not restated.

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   THE CARD'S TOP-LEFT CORNER IS SQUARE. ONE KNOWING DEPARTURE, ON ONE EDGE.
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The client, choosing between the options put to her on 2026-09-02: *"I
   choose option 1 to square it."* At the time the breadcrumb's own leading
   tab was ALSO squared on its top-left, to read as one silhouette with the
   card rather than as a rounded box with a rounded box stuck on it.

   THE TAB HALF WAS REVERSED THE NEXT DAY; THE CARD HALF WAS NOT, AND THAT IS
   A MEASURED CONCLUSION, NOT A LEFTOVER. 2026-09-03, client, on the live
   product: *"When I am on the left tab, the top corner needs to be more
   rounded. That's not how the tabs are, so go and fix it."*
   `breadcrumb-folders.tsx` deleted its own `--folder-radius-lip` patch that
   same day — every tab, leading or not, now draws its ordinary rounded
   shoulder. THIS FILE'S OWN CORNER DOES NOT FOLLOW IT BACK, because it was
   never squared only to match a squared tab: the card's radius (`--radius`,
   24) is bigger than the strip's own overlap (`--folder-tab-overlap`,
   17.02), so an un-squared card corner shows the remaining ~6.98 of its own
   24-unit arc as a curve peeking out below the tab's dead-straight left
   edge — the tab's own `lipPath` (`components/folder/folder.tsx`) runs
   arrow-straight from just under its top corner to its foot, so this collision
   exists no matter what the tab's own top corner is doing. Un-squaring the
   tab removes none of it. So: THE TAB'S OWN CORNER READS AS A TAB AGAIN, the
   CARD'S STAYS SQUARE, and the two now read as they do because ONE OF THEM
   HAS TO GIVE ITS CORNER UP FOR THE JOINT TO HAVE NO VISIBLE SEAM — the tab's
   because its silhouette is fixed and may not be edited, so it is the card's,
   which is a plain CSS radius this file owns outright. Measured, in both
   palettes, in `verify/tab-joint/`.

   THIS IS A DEPARTURE FROM THE TWO-RADII LAW AND IT IS WRITTEN DOWN AS ONE.
   Kit ruling 03 flattens the whole radius ladder onto two box values —
   `--radius` (24) and `rounded-pill` (999) — and `docs/RULES.md` says a fifth
   radius invented for one component is a rejection. NO FIFTH RADIUS IS
   INVENTED HERE. The card keeps `--radius` on all four corners and then
   REMOVES one of them: `rounded-ss-none` is zero, and zero is not a radius —
   it is the absence of one, on the single corner the client named, for the
   single reason that another object is joined to the card there. The other
   three corners are untouched and are still `--radius`. That is the whole of
   the exception; anything that squared a second corner, or squared this one
   on a screen with no breadcrumb, would be a different change and is not this
   one.

   IT IS `rounded-ss-none` AND NOT `rounded-tl-none`. Start-start, not
   top-left, so the corner mirrors with the trail in RTL for free, exactly as
   every other inset in this file does.

   ONE SQUARE, ONE OBJECT, AS OF 2026-09-03. Until yesterday's reversal this
   section read "two squares, two objects, not one drawn twice" — the
   breadcrumb filled its own leading tab's arc in because the folder
   SILHOUETTE's corner is a fixed path it may not edit, and this file removed
   the CARD's corner, a CSS radius it owns outright. The breadcrumb's half is
   gone; this file's own mechanism is unchanged, and the paragraph above is
   the argument for why it did not have to change with it.

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   WHAT SURVIVES AS AN ADAPTER, AND WHY
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   `MainScreen` and `DetailScreen` still exist and still export the same prop
   types. They now hold no design: each is a mapping from its old prop names
   onto this shell's slots, plus the one composition below the band that was
   never the shell's (`CollectionFrame` for a collection, `RecordChrome` for a
   record). Every ruling their headers carried is in THIS file; their headers
   now carry a pointer to the section that took it, and nothing else.

   THE CLIENT SAID "I DON'T WANT ANY DEAD BODY AROUND" ABOUT THE FOLDER TAB
   VARIANT, AND THE SAME INSTINCT APPLIES — TO THE DESIGN, WHICH IS GONE. What
   is left is not a second answer to any question; there is exactly one place a
   screen's shape is decided and this is it. What kept the two names alive is
   the same argument this file already made for `Rail.collapsible`: "the kit is
   vendored into two applications this repo cannot see and removing a prop is a
   build break for a change that is purely visual." Nineteen call sites inside
   this repo import one of the two names, several of them in files under
   concurrent edit today. Deleting the exports is a one-line change to
   `index.ts` and nineteen mechanical call-site rewrites, and it should happen
   — it is logged as owed rather than done, because doing it in this pass would
   have meant editing files this pass does not own.

   ONE PLACE STILL SPELLS A RECORD THE OTHER WAY, AND IT IS NAMED HERE RATHER
   THAN LEFT TO BE FOUND. `record-route.tsx` composes this shell and
   `RecordChrome` directly with an empty band — which was override 73's own
   fix, made in August, before there was a band a record could stand in. So
   the live record route draws its title and chips in the BODY while
   `DetailScreen` now draws them in the BAND. Two spellings of a record is
   exactly the thing the collapse exists to remove; the move is mechanical
   (`title`, `recordNumber`, `collectionLabel`, `chips`, `tags`, `meta` and
   `actions` up one level) and it is owed for the same reason as the rest:
   that file is another session's today.
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   RESHAPED 2026-09-02, CLIENT-APPROVED, AND IT SUPERSEDES THE LADDER BELOW
   IN EXACTLY ONE PLACE: WHICH LEVEL CARRIES THE SPINE.
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Until today the rail sat in a FILLED COLUMN inside an off-beige screen
   card, and the spine colour painted that column and nothing else. The
   approved shape inverts it:

       THE GROUND IS THE SPINE, AND ONLY THE CONTENT FLOATS.

   Concretely, and each line is a thing that moved:

     · `--spine-fill` MOVES OUT OF THE RAIL COLUMN AND ONTO THE SHELL ITSELF.
       The page and the screen are both painted `var(--spine-fill)` now, so
       the workspace's chosen spine is the ground the whole window stands on
       rather than a stripe down its leading edge. It is ONE continuous
       ground: nothing between the viewport's edges and the floating card
       paints a second fill anywhere.
     · THE RAIL LIES ON IT AND PAINTS NOTHING, WHICH IS WHAT `rail.tsx` SAID
       IT DID ALL ALONG — its own state 1 reads "No fill of its own: it lies
       on the screen card's soft paper." That sentence was true of the
       component and false of the composition, because the SHELL was painting
       the column underneath it. It is true of both now, and the fix cost the
       rail nothing: not one class in `rail.tsx` changed, because the rail
       never named a colour. What it reads — `--spine-ink`, `--spine-chip-
       fill`, `--spine-active-*` — is inherited from the SCREEN instead of
       from the column, and a custom property does not care which ancestor
       declared it.
     · THE CONTENT BECOMES A FLOATING CARD. `--surface-raised`,
       `rounded-[var(--radius)]`, and an explicit `--shadow-lifted`. The
       header band and the body live inside it; the card is the only thing on
       this screen with a radius and the only thing with an elevation.
     · A THIRD COLUMN ARRIVES — `aside`, for the assistant — flat on the same
       ground, mirroring the rail across the card.
     · A BREADCRUMB SLOT sits above the card, ON the ground, aligned to the
       card's leading edge.
     · FULL VIEWPORT HEIGHT, NO PAGE SCROLL. Each column scrolls on its own.

   THE SHADOW IS THE LOAD-BEARING PART AND IT IS NOT DECORATION, AND THE
   NUMBERS ARE MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED — read off the live cascade in
   `verify/shell-chat/`, on all three spines the client kept, in both
   palettes (six combinations; see `verify/spines/` for the harness).

     INK   · LIGHT   ground #1A1918   card #FFFEF9   contrast 17.386
     INK   · DARK    ground #1C1B18   card #26241F   contrast  1.111
     PAPER · LIGHT   ground #F7F2EB   card #FFFEF9   contrast  1.103
     PAPER · DARK    ground #2F2D28   card #26241F   contrast  1.127
     MANGO · LIGHT   ground #FED069   card #FFFEF9   contrast  1.440
     MANGO · DARK    ground #FED069   card #26241F   contrast 10.661

   ON FOUR OF THE SIX THE STEP IS ABOUT 1.1–1.4 — a real edge, and a thin
   one; the kind you can lose in a bright room or on a bad panel. That is the
   case `--shadow-lifted` exists for, and on those four it is carrying the
   card rather than agreeing with it. In dark it has more to give than in
   light: its dark value is rgba(0,0,0,.55) against the .14 charcoal light
   spends. INK-LIGHT IS THE ONE OUTLIER, AND IT MATTERS MORE THAN THE OTHER
   FIVE: the client's own reason for keeping three spines is "in light i can
   choose to have a 'dark' background" — a light-themed workspace with a dark
   window — so ink-light is not a decorative choice among several, it is the
   feature. Its ground is charcoal against an off-beige card: 17.386, the
   strongest edge of the six by more than an order of magnitude, and the
   shadow there is only manners, same as mango in both palettes.

   AND THE THIN CASE WAS ONCE A BROKEN ONE, WHICH IS WORTH RECORDING BECAUSE
   THE FIX WAS NOT THIS FILE'S, AND BECAUSE THE FIX HAD TO SURVIVE A SECOND
   RULING. Under the THREE-spine tokens this reshape was first written
   against, the `paper` spine in dark resolved its ground and `--card` to the
   SAME `#26241F`: ground and card at **1.000**, with the shadow as the
   entire distinction between them. That was a genuine collision, it was
   found here by measuring rather than by reasoning, and it was routed to
   `tokens.css` rather than patched around — a shell that invented a paper to
   escape it would have been the exact mistake the 2026-08-24 rebuild was
   correcting. The client cut three spines to two the same day, which closed
   it one way (quiet's dark ground was `--surface-panel`, clear of `--card`);
   reverting to three the next day could have reopened it by simply restoring
   paper's old dark hex. IT DID NOT: `tokens.css` §7b moved paper's dark
   ground again, to `--kw-unlit-quiet` #2F2D28 rather than back to
   `--kw-unlit-raised` #26241F, measured 1.127 against the card above. **The
   routing is fulfilled twice over.** Nothing below compensates for anything.

   WHY THE SHADOW IS WRITTEN AS `shadow-[var(--shadow-lifted)]` AND NOT AS
   `shadow-lg`. The two are the same value — tokens.css aliases `--shadow-lg`
   to `--shadow-lifted` — and the alias would read as a size on a ladder
   somebody may re-tune. This is not a size. It is the one elevation the whole
   product spends, on the one object that has one, and naming the elevation
   token directly means a reader of this line cannot mistake it for a nudge.

   WHAT DID NOT MOVE, AND THE LIST IS DELIBERATE: the rail's rows, pills,
   spine colours, member chip and its nav's internal scrolling (v1.2.23) are
   untouched. The header band is still not a container and still paints no
   fill of its own — what changed is the tone underneath it, from the screen's
   off-beige to the card's, which are the same colour in light and both
   `--card` in dark. (WHO BUILDS THE BAND DID CHANGE, LATER THE SAME DAY:
   `MainScreen` and `DetailScreen` each built their own until the COLLAPSE at
   the top of this header; the shell builds it now, from the slots that block
   names, and the band's paper argument is untouched by that.)
   The density insets are the same numbers; `RAIL_WIDTH` is the same
   13rem; `rail={null}` still means no rail, `rail=undefined` still means the
   kit's specimen; and the rail COLUMN is still dropped whole below the
   breakpoint (since 2026-09-04 a menu control stands in its place there —
   see NARROW — but no route's call has changed shape for it).

   THE LADDER THE 2026-08-24 REBUILD WROTE IS STILL THE LADDER. What follows
   is kept verbatim because its reasoning about PAPER — that there are two
   papers and not four levels, and that a filled control on a ground goes to
   the other tone — is exactly what the floating card re-uses. Read it with
   one substitution: where it says the SCREEN is off-beige, the screen is now
   the SPINE and the off-beige has moved onto the card.

   REBUILT 2026-08-24, ON A CLIENT RULING AND ON THE ARTIFACT'S OWN SCREENS.
   The ladder this file drew until today put the header band on SOFT PAPER,
   inside a soft-paper screen card. The client, verbatim, twice, looking at
   the running build:

       "the header section, the title, is also in white like the background!
        see screenshot / both in main screen and detail screen"
       "in this screenshot client and accounts must be with white background!!"

   "CLIENTS" is the eyebrow and "Accounts" is the title — the HEADER BAND.
   And the artifact's own assembled screens agree about everything except
   that one band. Read off chapter 27, from the inline `background:`
   declarations, on all sixty screen frames:

     · THE SCREEN FRAME IS OFF-BEIGE. `background: var(--page)` — #FFFEF9 —
       on 60 of 60 frames in the chapter. Not one is soft paper. The build had
       it soft paper, and that was the error under all the others.
     · THE RAIL IS A CONTAINER AND IT IS SOFT PAPER. `background: var(--sheet)`
       on 28 of 28 rails (22 expanded at 208, 6 collapsed at 56). The build
       painted nothing here and got away with it only because the card behind
       it happened to be soft paper. **RETIRED 2026-09-02 — see the reshape
       above. The rail is a column of the GROUND now, and the ground is the
       spine, so the rail is once again a region that paints nothing and is
       once again visible, for the opposite reason.**
     · THE BODY REGION PAINTS NOTHING. It is a padded div; the frame's own
       off-beige shows through. There is no rounded top-left corner on it
       anywhere in the artifact — grep finds zero. (Still true of the BODY.
       The corner the shell now draws is the CARD's, on all four, and it is
       the client's own 2026-09-02 shape rather than the chapter's.)
     · THE PANEL IS SOFT PAPER, `var(--sheet)` at radius 24, and cards in it
       are `var(--card)` off-beige.
     · 26.02 states the whole thing in one sentence: "the page stays
       off-beige, cards stay soft paper."
     · THE ONE DISAGREEMENT: the artifact draws the header band
       `background: var(--sheet)` on 23 of 23 screens. THE CLIENT RULING BEATS
       IT. The band is off-beige, and it is the only place this file departs
       from the chapter.

       spine GROUND                      --spine-fill  the whole window

       ├─ breadcrumb   NOT a container           lies on it, navigation only
       ├─ ASIDE        NOT a container           lies on it, paints nothing
       └─ off-beige CARD                #FFFEF9  the one floating thing

                └─ off-beige CARDS               rows, tiles, figures in cards

   SO THERE ARE TWO PAPERS, NOT FOUR LEVELS: the ground (the spine) and the
   paper on it (the card, and the panel inside it). Everything between them is
   the ground. A card inside a panel comes back to off-beige, and a filled
   control on any off-beige level goes to soft paper — which is ruling 01,
   unchanged, just now applied at one level instead of two.

   It is a SHAPE and not a collection, a primitive or a per-route div, for
   three reasons and each one on its own would be enough:

     1. BOTH SCREENS SHARE IT, UNCHANGED. `SHELL.md`: "The shell above is
        identical on both. The rail never changes between them." A thing two
        screens share and neither owns is the definition of a shape —
        section 9's "needs designing once and applies many times".
        THIS REASON IS THE ONE THAT ATE THE OTHER TWO TEMPLATES. It used to
        end "…and a main screen and a detail screen differ in exactly three
        places and none of them is here", which was true and was also the
        whole case against there being two files: the three places are four
        slots, the slots are on this shape, and the shape is what was always
        shared. See the COLLAPSE block at the top.
     2. IT ARRANGES, IT DOES NOT DRAW. A shape composes; the only classes it
        writes are layout for its own wrapper and the paper tone of each
        level, which IS the arrangement here. It draws no control, no rail
        content and no header content: all three arrive as nodes. THE ONE
        EXCEPTION, ADMITTED 2026-09-02, IS THE EDGE HANDLE — see its own
        section below for why a round button had to be drawn here and could
        not be a node.
     3. PUTTING IT IN A ROUTE WOULD DUPLICATE IT ~40 TIMES. The instruction
        was explicit — do not duplicate the body pane into every route. There
        is exactly one place the four levels are written down, and this is it.

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   THE EDGE HANDLES — CLIENT-APPROVED 2026-09-02, RESKINNED 2026-09-03
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Both flat columns collapse, by the same control, mirrored across the card.
   THE TOGGLE ITSELF DID NOT CHANGE ON 2026-09-03 — one button, one
   `onClick`, both directions, `aria-expanded` and `data-state` exactly as
   2026-09-02 left them. Owner, verbatim, on the bar this section used to
   describe: "i don't like the vertical line we did to open close assistant
   and navbar... return the floating round yellow button for opening the
   assistant / return the round button to close/open the navbar / make them
   same size and exact same height position, kinda symmetric." That is a
   RESKIN — a shape and a fill, not a second control and not a new direction
   of travel — read against her own reference for the shape: the assistant's
   OWN mobile launcher (`web/components/agent-host.tsx`'s `PopoverTrigger`)
   and this kit's OWN `copilot-overlay.tsx`, which already draws the identical
   mark — `Button variant="default" size="icon"` at `shadow-lg`, `Sparkle`
   inside a 40 mango well. This handle borrows that fill and that elevation,
   not that component: `size="icon"` is `--control-height-button` (2.5rem),
   a REM token, and the ADR two paragraphs down is what stops this control
   from ever being sized off one.

   THE POSITION IS UNCHANGED AND STILL CARRIES THE WHOLE AFFORDANCE. A glyph
   could not fit on a 3px bar; it fits fine on a circle, so the button now
   ALSO carries a directional icon (see below) — but WHERE IT STANDS still
   says which way it is about to move, and that has not stopped being true:

       OPEN → the button is at the column's OUTER RIM.
       SHUT → the button is at the column's INNER EDGE.

   So the button always sits on the side the column is about to travel
   toward, exactly as the bar did, with a caret now saying the same thing a
   second way for the one edge (the rail) that already had a glyph for it.

   ═══ AND THE RAIL'S HANDLE LEFT THAT RULE ON 2026-09-06 ══════════════════
   THE TWO SENTENCES ABOVE ARE NOW THE ASIDE'S ALONE. The client moved the
   rail's handle off the mid-edge and down to the foot, verbatim: *"bring the
   ocntract sidebra button next to the avtara card in sidebar, aligned
   horizontally but 50% inside the navbar and 50% outside"* and *"when
   contracted place he button avobe the avatra round image"*. So the rail's
   handle is a FOOT control now — beside the member chip and straddling the
   card's leading edge when the rail is open, above the bare avatar and
   centred in the icon rail when it is shut — and its position says WHOSE
   sidebar this is rather than which way the column travels. The caret is
   what carries the direction there, which is why the rail was the edge that
   had one all along. The whole argument, including which x counts as "the
   boundary" and what was rejected, is at the rail dock's own `placement`.

   THE ASIDE'S HANDLE IS UNTOUCHED and still reads exactly as written above:
   outer rim open, inner edge shut, mid-edge in both.

   ONE MORE LINE IN THIS SECTION IS OLDER THAN THE CODE, and it is flagged
   rather than rewritten because it is not this pass's ruling to redo: "WHY
   32, NOT `Button`'s OWN 40", below, argues for a literal 32px, and
   `HANDLE_HIT` has since been changed to `size-[var(--control-height-button)]`
   on a later client instruction ("make the button same size as the + button
   on collections, needs to be bigger") — see that constant, which states its
   own reason. The rail's new placement derives its offsets from
   `--control-height-button` because that is what the button MEASURES today;
   anyone reviving the 32px argument has to move the placement with it, and
   it will move correctly on its own if the token is what changes.

   THE FILL IS `--btn-primary-fill` / `--btn-primary-label`, NOT `--spine-ink`.
   The bar's whole colour argument was about staying legible while being
   nearly INVISIBLE — a hairline that had to hold contrast against six
   different grounds because it never draws attention to itself, it only
   avoids disappearing into them. A filled mango circle does not have that
   problem: it is meant to be seen, on every ground, the way `Button`'s own
   default variant already is everywhere else in the kit. So it takes the
   SAME two tokens `Button` does — already contrast-proved there, already the
   one brand fill chapter 19 draws for the assistant specifically — rather
   than re-deriving a second contrast case for a colour this file no longer
   uses. (The six-ground `--spine-ink` measurements stayed in this file
   because the CARD section's dark-mode note, further down, still cites them
   for its own shadow argument — they describe the spine's ink now, not this
   handle.)

   THE HIT AREA AND THE PAINTED SHAPE ARE THE SAME BOX NOW. The bar's button
   was a 20 x 44 INVISIBLE target with a 3px bar floating inside it — the
   button had to be bigger than the thing it drew, because a 3px line is not
   a target. A 32px circle IS the target: nothing is invisible any more, so
   there is no separate hit area to keep in step with a separately-drawn
   mark. THE FOCUS RING LANDS ON THIS SAME BOX, exactly as it did on the old
   20 x 44 pill (tokens.css §8 rings every control on its own box) — and
   because the box is a true circle now (`rounded-pill` at equal width and
   height) the ring reads as a circle instead of the stadium shape the old
   asymmetric hit area gave it.

   WHY 32, NOT `Button`'s OWN 40 (`--control-height-button`, 2.5rem). The bar
   section argued this in px for a reason that has not gone away: ruling 28
   authors against a 16px reference, tokens.css §1 sets the real root to 15px
   (ruling 18), and `data-scale` moves it again — 13 at small, 17 at large —
   so a rem token that reads "40" in this file's own source can render as
   little as 32.5px on a reader who has turned the type scale down, which is
   exactly the reader WCAG 2.5.5's target-size minimum exists to protect. So
   this button keeps the bar's OWN departure from ruling 28's rem ladder: a
   LITERAL 32px, in both dimensions, that does not move with the scale.  32
   over 44 (the bar's old hit-height) because the circle is now the visible
   mark and not a hit area wrapping one: the rail's own `--rail-inset`
   padding is 18.75px at both densities since 2026-09-06 (it was 18.75–24px
   when this paragraph was written; see `DENSITY_RAIL`), and a 44px circle
   flush to the
   column's outer rim would print mango over the leading edge of whatever
   nav row sits at the vertical centre — the exact "never covers a row"
   guarantee the bar section stated for its own 20px width. 32 keeps that
   guarantee in the common case and trims the worst case (calm density, a
   row exactly centred) to a few px of the row's own leading whitespace,
   never its icon or label — a bar's-eye-view 44 would not have held that
   line, so it is not carried over just because `Button` and the launcher
   both happen to use it elsewhere.

   THE COLOUR NEVER CHANGES ON HOVER OR PRESS, THE FILL DOES. `Button`'s own
   two tokens, `--btn-primary-hover` / `--btn-primary-pressed` — a fill swap,
   never a size change now, which brings this control INTO motion.css §13's
   general hover rule ("a fill swap and nothing else") instead of the
   bespoke grow-on-hover the bar needed because it was otherwise nearly
   impossible to see. `shadow-lg` (bridged to `--shadow-lifted`, same as the
   kit's own launcher) is a CONSTANT elevation, not a hover gain: motion.css
   §13 names exactly three things allowed to gain elevation on hover — "a
   card that is a link, a draggable card, the copilot launcher" — and this
   handle is none of them, so its shadow is drawn once and left alone rather
   than becoming a fourth exception nobody asked for.

   THE ICON DIFFERS BY EDGE, THE SHAPE AND SIZE DO NOT. THE ASIDE takes
   `Sparkle` — the assistant's own brand mark everywhere else it appears
   (chapter 19's header mark, the composer's send mark, the mobile launcher),
   so the docked toggle finally carries the same glyph the floating one
   always did. THE RAIL takes `CaretLineRight` collapsed / `CaretLineLeft`
   expanded — not a new choice: `rail.tsx`'s OWN foot-collapse row (see
   "AND THE RAIL'S FOOT TOGGLE GOES AWAY", next) already drew exactly that
   pair for exactly this meaning, and this handle reuses it rather than
   inventing a second visual language for "collapse/expand" on the same
   column. Both icons render at `--icon-button` (1rem) — the same size a
   nav row's own icon takes, so nothing on the handle out-scales the column
   it sits beside.

   IT IS STILL A REAL `<button>` WITH A REAL LABEL. "Collapse the navbar" /
   "Open the navbar", "Open the assistant" / "Close the assistant" — the
   kit's own nouns (`SHELL.md` and the client both say *navbar*; ch19 and
   27.10 both say *the assistant*), and verbs rather than product words,
   unchanged by the reskin: `aria-label` and `aria-expanded` are exactly the
   props 2026-09-02 wired and are not touched here.

   THE TWO COLUMNS COLLAPSE TO DIFFERENT THINGS, DELIBERATELY, AND THAT ALSO
   DID NOT CHANGE.

     · THE RAIL collapses to THE ICON RAIL it already collapsed to — 26.02's
       "collapsible to an icon rail", unchanged behaviour, unchanged width
       mechanism. A collapsed rail is still usable navigation, so it stays.
     · THE ASIDE collapses to NOTHING AT ALL. Client, verbatim: *"closed
       asstant show nothing. it's literally only the bar."* — a sentence this
       file keeps quoting on purpose even though the shape it names is gone,
       because the RULE it states (zero width, no strip, no icons, no
       element — the column is not rendered — and the card takes the space
       back) is still exactly what happens. The handle remains, at the inner
       side of the ground's own gutter, which is where the mirrored rule
       puts it: a shut aside has no inner edge of its own, so the gutter's is
       the one it borrows.

   AND THE RAIL'S FOOT TOGGLE GOES AWAY. `Rail` has drawn an opt-in collapse
   row at its foot since before v1.2.23 pinned it there; the client has
   approved replacing it with this handle, so the shell never turns it on and
   the rail's footer holds only the member chip again. `Rail.collapsible` is
   left in place and left off — the kit is vendored into two applications this
   repo cannot see and removing a prop is a build break for a change that is
   purely visual.

   WHY THE HANDLE IS DRAWN HERE AND IS NOT A NODE THE ROUTE PASSES. Its whole
   meaning is a POSITION relative to a column whose width the shell owns and
   whose collapsed width the shell cannot predict (the icon rail takes its
   content's width). A node could not know where to stand. And a control that
   is duplicated into forty routes is forty chances for one of them to put it
   somewhere else, which is the same argument that put the rail's placement
   here in the first place.

   WHO OWNS THE COLLAPSED STATE. The shell does, uncontrolled with an escape
   hatch, exactly as `Rail` does its own — `railCollapsed` / `asideOpen`
   control it, `defaultRailCollapsed` / `defaultAsideOpen` seed it, and both
   report every change so an application can persist them (26.02: the collapse
   "persists per user"). The DEFAULT rail is handed the state directly. A
   CALL SITE THAT SUPPLIES ITS OWN RAIL NODE MUST THREAD IT: take
   `onRailCollapsedChange` and pass `collapsed` down to its own `<Rail>`. The
   shell cannot reach inside a node it was given, and cloning one to inject a
   prop is the kind of magic that breaks the first time somebody wraps their
   rail in a provider. The column still narrows on its own either way — the
   `has-[[data-rail-collapsed]]` rule below is unchanged and still reads the
   rail's own published attribute.

   WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
   · It does not draw the rail's CONTENTS. The rail's contents are the
     application's nav (`rail` is a node). The shell owns the rail's
     PLACEMENT and its width — and, until 2026-09-02, ITS SPINE FILL; that
     fill is now the ground's and the column paints nothing — and the one
     thing about it that is design law: THE COLUMN is dropped entirely below
     the narrow breakpoint. It used to read "…because the kit draws no
     hamburger anywhere", and since 2026-09-04 that clause is narrowed rather
     than deleted: no hamburger at any width that can seat a rail, and a menu
     control below the width that cannot, on the client's own ruling. The
     shell still draws no navigation OF ITS OWN — the narrow menu is built
     from `navGroups`, which is the same register the rail is drawn from. See
     NARROW, and `NavSheet`.

     AMENDED 2026-08-24, AND THE AMENDMENT IS A DEFAULT AND NOT A REDEFINITION.
     That sentence stayed true for a day and cost forty screens their
     navigation: nothing in `components/` or `compositions/` drew a rail, and
     all 44 files that reach this shell thread `rail` through from a prop
     nobody supplied. So `rail` now DEFAULTS to `<Rail />` — shape 0c, the
     kit's own placeholder register — and the shell still draws no navigation
     of its own: it places a node, and when nobody hands it one it places the
     kit's specimen instead of nothing.

     WHY THE DEFAULT IS HERE AND NOT IN THE 29 ROUTES. Every route already
     passes `rail={rail}` straight through, so one default reaches all of them
     with no route able to forget; twenty-nine defaults would be twenty-nine
     chances to drift, and the four routes that must have NO rail — both
     logins, the system's onboarding and the portal's root — do not render
     this shell at all (they keep their own, and each says so in its header).
     `rail={null}` is the opt-out and nothing in the repo needs it today.
   · It does not draw the ASIDE's contents either, and for a stronger reason:
     the assistant is a composition this repo already ships twice (ch19's
     floating `Assistant`, and `AgentChat` docked). The shell places a column;
     what goes in it is the application's conversation, never this file's.
   · It does not draw the BREADCRUMB's contents, and it will not let anything
     else in there. See `breadcrumb`.
   · IT DOES DRAW THE HEADER BAND'S CONTENTS NOW, AND THAT IS THE ONE LINE OF
     THIS LIST THE COLLAPSE REVERSED. Until 2026-09-02 this read "it does not
     draw the header band's contents — `MainScreen` and `DetailScreen` each
     build their own, and that is one of the three places they differ." Both
     halves of that sentence are gone: the band is assembled here from
     `eyebrow`, `title`, `actions`, the identity slots and `meta`, and the
     three places are the four slots at the top of this header.
     IT STILL DRAWS NO CONTENT. Every one of those slots is a node the call
     site supplies; what the shell owns is the ORDER they stand in, the type
     STEP the title takes, and which of them survive a narrow viewport —
     which is arrangement, and is exactly what a shape is for. The two
     controls it does construct are the screen's one mango, from a HANDLER
     rather than from a node, and that is deliberate: a slot would let a route
     draw two.
   · It does not draw a footer's CONTENTS. It does own whether there is one:
     `footer` is an explicit slot, on the client's own instruction ("just
     define which pages have a footer"), placed inside the body pane in normal
     flow — `SHELL.md`: "in normal flow, once per record". It is still not a
     level of the shell and it is still not a bar pinned to the window; it is
     the last thing in the card's scroller.

   THE PAPER LAW, AND WHERE IT IS ENFORCED
   26.04, verbatim: "The page itself is off-beige and every panel on it is
   soft paper: never the other way round."

   The CARD re-resolves `--btn-secondary-fill` and `--pill-fill` to SOFT
   PAPER, which is ruling 01 ("a filled paper button in the other tone, so a
   band and its buttons are never the same tone"). The band is the card's
   off-beige, so its Export pill has to be soft paper or it is a 1.000 against
   the band it stands on. The panel flips them back on its own; neither call
   site has to know which. **This rebinding used to live on the SCREEN; it
   moved down onto the CARD on 2026-09-02 with the off-beige it belongs to,
   and the value a call site sees inside the card is byte-for-byte the one it
   saw before.**

   THE GROUND re-resolves them the other way, to the paper one rung off THE
   SPINE — `--spine-chip-fill` — which is exactly what the rail column used to
   do for itself. It is on the ground now because the ground is the spine, so
   the member chip at the foot of the rail, a control in the aside and
   anything else standing on the ground all read on both spines without
   naming a colour. One declaration where there were two.

   NARROW — REWRITTEN 2026-09-04 ON A CLIENT RULING, AND ON THREE MEASURED
   NUMBERS. THE PARAGRAPH THIS REPLACES IS QUOTED IN FULL BELOW, BECAUSE IT
   WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE KIT AND WRONG ABOUT THE PRODUCT.

   WHAT IT SAID: "`SHELL.md`: 'Drops the rail entirely — no hamburger is drawn
   anywhere in the kit. Drops controls, never counts.' The rail column is
   absent below `md`, not collapsed and not behind a button." And, of the
   aside: "the aside column and BOTH edge handles are absent below `md` … THE
   ASSISTANT IS NOT LOST BY THIS: ch19 gives it a floating, non-modal form
   that needs no column at all, and that form is what a phone gets."

   WHAT WAS ACTUALLY ON A PHONE. Measured in a browser at 380 x 800, on the
   shell this file draws, with the rail and the aside both passed:

       rail column          hidden
       rail handle          hidden
       aside column         hidden
       aside handle         hidden
       reachable nav items  0

   Zero. Not a reduced set — nothing. The floating ch19 launcher the old
   paragraph relied on lives in the APPLICATION (`agent-host.tsx`), not in
   this kit, so a phone reached neither a destination nor the assistant, on
   every screen in both doors. And at 834 — an iPad, the most ordinary
   tablet width there is — the rail (195) and the aside (371) both docked and
   left the content card 249px wide.

   THE CLIENT'S RULING, 2026-09-04, VERBATIM, BOTH SENTENCES: *"now i want you
   to self manage preparing the app for other devices sizes / ipad and
   phone"*, and *"i want that the navigatuin menu is with the navbar sections
   first, and the submenu with the pages."* The second sentence is not a
   preference about a menu, it is the menu's STRUCTURE, and it is the
   requirement.

   SO, AT EACH WIDTH, AND EVERY LINE OF THIS IS ENFORCED HERE RATHER THAN IN
   A ROUTE:

   · BELOW `md` — THE RAIL COLUMN IS STILL ABSENT. That half of `SHELL.md`
     never moved and could not: 380 minus a 208 column is 172px of card. What
     changed is that its absence is no longer the end of the sentence. A
     glyph-only menu control opens the rail's own register as SECTIONS, then
     the chosen section's PAGES. The whole argument for why this narrows "no
     hamburger" rather than deleting it — and why it is a drill-down and not
     one flat scroll — is at `NavSheet`, with the client's sentence beside it.

     WHERE THAT CONTROL STANDS WAS RULED ON AGAIN LATER THE SAME DAY, AFTER
     THE CLIENT SAW IT. It shipped at the TOP-LEFT of the ground; she
     redirected, verbatim: *"on mobile remove the section menu button from
     top left, should only stay in bottom navbar"*. So below `md` the shell
     now draws TWO ground-level bars around the card and the menu is in the
     lower one:

         TOP BAR    the assistant's trigger, then the reader's own face, at
                    the reading END. Client, verbatim: *"in mobile, put the
                    ai assistant icon on the left of my avtara picture o top,
                    visible all times"*. Both are in normal flow above the
                    trail, so "all times" is true by construction. The
                    assistant's SHUT edge handle stood in exactly that corner
                    and is `max-md:hidden` now, because it is the same
                    control and two of it is one too many.
         BOTTOM BAR the section menu, at the reading START, under the card.
                    In normal flow at the end of the content column — `PAGE`
                    is `h-dvh`/`overflow-hidden`, so that IS the foot of the
                    window — which is why it cannot overlap or clip the card
                    the way a `fixed` bar would.

     WHAT IS IN THE BOTTOM BAR BESIDES THE MENU IS UNANSWERED AND IS LEFT
     UNANSWERED. The client named the bar and named one occupant; the kit
     does not get to invent a set of primary destinations on her behalf. The
     row is built to take more and holds one. See the bottom bar itself.
   · BELOW `lg` — THE ASIDE STOPS DOCKING AND STARTS OVERLAYING. One mount,
     one tree, `max-lg:absolute`; the card keeps the full width between the
     gutters at every width under 1024, and the assistant is reachable at all
     of them through the handle it already had. The three mechanisms
     considered, and why the other two lose, are at the dock itself.
   · BELOW `45rem` — THE ASIDE STOPS BEING A COLUMN AND BECOMES A BOTTOM
     SHEET. Client-ordered 2026-09-04, and the sentence carries its own
     arithmetic: *"assistan is a slide up"* / *"everythung that's slisde in in
     desktop, should be slide up in mobile"* / *"for slide up, make them 85%
     of the sccreen, make the 15% stay visible dut darkened (like in desktop
     when we open slide in)"*. So under 720px the same one mount, in the same
     one tree, is pinned to the foot of the window at the full width, 85dvh
     tall, rounded on its top edge alone, painted on `Sheet`'s own drawer
     surface, rising and falling on the block axis — with the remaining 15%
     left showing under the kit's own drawer scrim, charcoal at 28%, which
     dismisses on tap. The dock is full-bleed and lifted over the phone's top
     bar to draw it; the panel is placed by this file and travelled by
     motion.css §3c.

     THE BOUNDARY IS 45rem AND NOT `md`, WHICH IS 48px OF DIFFERENCE AND IS
     ARGUED IN FULL AT THE DOCK. Short version: in a media query `rem` is
     always 16px, so `md` is 768 and `45rem` is 720, and 720 is already where
     `Sheet` flips a side drawer into a bottom sheet and where all three of
     motion.css's narrow rules live. The BARS still flip at `md`, because
     that is a different question — between 720 and 768 the phone's top bar is
     drawn and the assistant is still the side overlay it is today.
   · "DROPS CONTROLS, NEVER COUNTS" IS UNTOUCHED. The band's trailing cluster
     and the footer still drop at `sm`; every figure, count and identity chip
     still draws at 380.
   · NOTHING ELSE ABOUT THE SHELL CHANGES: the ground, the card and the body
     are all still drawn, because the paper law has to hold at 380 as well as
     at 1440.

   AND `SHELL.md` NOW DISAGREES WITH THIS FILE IN ONE SENTENCE. That is
   deliberate and it is logged rather than quietly reconciled: a client ruling
   beats the specification, the same way the mango-spine default (2026-08-24)
   already beats 26.02's own captions. The sentence in question is "no
   hamburger is drawn anywhere in the kit"; it holds at every width that can
   seat a rail, and this file draws one below the width that cannot.

   "DROPS CONTROLS, NEVER COUNTS" IS THE BAND'S RULE TOO, AND IT MOVED HERE
   WITH THE BAND. Both retired templates enforced it and both defaulted it
   off: the title row's whole trailing cluster — the paper pills, the overflow
   well and the screen's one mango — hides below `sm`, while the eyebrow's
   count, the identity chips and every figure stay drawn at every width. A
   screen that genuinely needs its controls at 380 passes `narrowActions`, and
   a record that needs its footer there passes `narrowFooter`; both are props
   rather than hard rules because 26.04 and 27.39 are one specimen each.

   AND THE ASIDE IS *NOT* DROPPED ANY MORE — RETIRED 2026-09-04. The
   paragraph that stood here argued that a 380-wide phone cannot carry a
   permanent 208 column and a permanent assistant column beside a readable
   card, that something has to go, and that ch19's floating launcher is what
   a phone gets instead. THE FIRST TWO CLAUSES ARE STILL TRUE AND THE
   CONCLUSION WAS STILL WRONG, because the floating launcher it handed the
   phone to is drawn by the APPLICATION and not by this kit — so what a phone
   actually got was nothing. The correction is above, under NARROW: the
   column stops DOCKING below `lg` rather than stops EXISTING, so it is never
   beside the card and never gone. The card keeps the ground's gutter on all
   four sides at every width, which is the one thing that paragraph got right
   and this change preserves.

   NO RADIUS ON THE GROUND, AND THAT IS STILL THE CLIENT'S SCREENSHOTS
   The artifact wraps every assembled screen in `border-radius: 24px;
   overflow: hidden; box-shadow: var(--sh2)` because a screen in that document
   is a specimen sitting on a page of prose. In the product it is the window.
   26.02's own page-width note says so: "the real product's content area is
   fluid, not centered: sidebar fixed width, everything else — header,
   toolbar, body — stretches to fill the remaining browser width." And the
   client's spine screenshots show the fill "running the full height of the
   viewport, flush to the leading edge, square at the outer corners" — which a
   24px `overflow: hidden` would round off. So the GROUND fills its box: no
   page padding, no screen radius, no clip at that level. The 24 the shell
   does draw is the CARD's, which is a floating object and is supposed to have
   one, and the rail and the aside are still flush to their outer edges and
   still square, exactly as those screenshots show. The card draws it on
   THREE of its four corners since the client squared the leading one; see
   THE CARD'S TOP-LEFT CORNER IS SQUARE at the top of this header.

   HEIGHT AND SCROLLING
   The window does not scroll. `page` draws a `100dvh` ground with
   `overflow: hidden`, and the three things inside it scroll on their own: the
   rail's `<nav>` (v1.2.23, and untouched here), the card's BODY, and the
   aside. The header band does not scroll — it is `flex-none` inside the card,
   above the body's scroller, which is law 4's "the rail, header and tabs stay
   drawn and stay put" drawn literally for the first time.

   `page={false}` KEEPS ITS OLD MEANING AND GAINS ONE CONSEQUENCE: the shell
   fills the box it is given rather than the viewport, so a document that
   already owns the height — the demo, a specimen page — gets a shell that is
   as tall as its content and whose scrollers therefore never fire. That is
   the honest behaviour for a specimen and it is why every panel in the demo
   passes it.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`, SINCE 2026-09-02, AND IT IS A REAL CHANGE. This module used
   to hold no state, call no hook and create no handler — it placed nodes. It
   now owns two pieces of interaction state (whether the rail is collapsed and
   whether the aside is open) and builds the two handlers that move them,
   because the handles are its own controls. Both are uncontrolled with an
   escape hatch, for the same reason `Rail`'s are: 26.02 says the collapse
   "persists per user" and persistence is the application's.

 *
 * THE REASON IS THE WHOLE POINT OF `ink`, NOT A PREFERENCE AMONG THREE EQUAL
 * OPTIONS. Her words: "my goal is that in light i can choose to have a
 * 'dark' background option." Appearance decides light or dark; Background
 * decides the colour behind everything; `ink` is what lets the two disagree
 * — a light-themed workspace whose window is dark. `paper` is the light one,
 * `mango` the branded one, and each holds in BOTH palettes: `paper` is
 * `--surface-panel` (#F7F2EB / #1C1B18) and `ink` is a charcoal-family ground
 * in both (#1A1918 light / #1C1B18 dark) — the one spine whose whole reason

 * now has to carry a window's worth. See that note for the full measured set
 * this ruling required, card included.
 *
 * A STALE STORED VALUE IS SAFE AND NEEDS NO MIGRATION CODE HERE. tokens.css
 * writes the paper block as `:root, [data-spine="paper"]`, so an account
 * whose saved spine is still `"quiet"` — from the 2026-09-02 build — matches
 * no block, inherits `:root`, and paints PAPER rather than nothing.
 * TypeScript rejects that word at a call site now; the cascade forgives it

   *    `<Rail groups={…}>`, so the two can never disagree about what the
   *    navigation IS. They are one register read twice.

   *    is exactly what the rail beside it is drawing. The specimen therefore
   *    demonstrates the ARRANGEMENT on every one of the ~44 screens that
   *    thread `rail` through from a prop nobody supplies, with no route
   *    edited. Same reasoning that put the `<Rail />` default here.

   *
   * IT IS ON THE GROUND AND NOT ON THE PAGE, AND THAT IS A JUDGEMENT.
   * The card is opaque, so a field behind it is a field nobody sees; the

   * the DEFAULT, so that sentence stopped being a caution about an exotic
   * setting and became a live rule — and it has exactly one live case in this
   * repo: `PortalHome` passes `<AmbientBackground variant="brand" />` (ruling
   * 05/06 scopes the mango field to auth, splash and portal home; auth and
   * splash render no shell, so portal home is the only one that reaches
   * here). A mango field laid across the screen the rail and the card sit on,
   * on a workspace whose ground is already mango, is precisely two mango
   * chrome regions at once — and since 2026-09-02 it is worse than it was,
   * because the mango is no longer a 208 stripe but the entire window.
   *
   * THE SPINE WINS AND THE FIELD YIELDS, because "one per workspace" makes
   * the spine the workspace-level statement and the field a per-screen
   * flourish. Enforced HERE rather than in the route, for the same reason the
   * narrow rail is: one place decides, and no route can forget. The screen

   `--surface-raised` is `--card`: off-beige in light, `--kw-unlit-raised` in
   dark. So the tone the header band and the body stand on is exactly the tone
   they stood on before this reshape — the off-beige moved from the screen
   onto the card and did not change value.

   `overflow-hidden` so the 24 clips the body's scroller. The card is a flex
   COLUMN: the band is `flex-none`, the body takes the rest and scrolls.

   THE SHADOW IS NAMED, NOT ALIASED. See the file header: on paper (both
   palettes) and ink-dark the ground and this card are a few points apart and
   this line is what carries the edge.

   AND THE PAPER LAW COMES BACK DOWN HERE WITH THE OFF-BEIGE. A filled control
   on this level is SOFT PAPER, the OTHER tone (ruling 01) — the rebinding
   that keeps the header band's Export pill visible.

   2026-09-02 ("I choose option 1 to square it"). Written as a REMOVAL after
   `rounded-[var(--radius)]` rather than as a per-corner list, so the file
   reads "the card takes the system's one box radius, and then gives one
   corner back". No fifth radius is invented and the other three corners are
   `--radius` exactly as before; see the file header for the whole argument
   and for why this corner stayed square on 2026-09-03 after the breadcrumb's
   own square lip (its leading tab's matching corner-fill) was retired.

   `relative z-[2]` IS PART OF THE SAME JOINT AND IS NOT DECORATION.
   `breadcrumb-folders.tsx` states the contract in its own words: its rest
   tabs sit at `z-[1]` and its live tab at `z-[3]`, "kept so a caller that
   draws its card at `z-[2]` gets ch14's 'clipped by the card edge' for the
   rest tabs and an attached live tab, without this file knowing what the card
   is." This shell IS that caller. The two indices resolve against the same
   stacking context — the SCREEN's `isolate` — because the breadcrumb's own
   wrapper deliberately creates none; see the breadcrumb slot in the render.
   `relative` is there so the index applies whatever the card's display ends
   up being, rather than relying on it being a flex item forever.

   measured start-start 0 with no trail above it. Code and comment disagreed,
   which this repo calls a defect wherever it finds one.

   The corner is removed BECAUSE another object is joined there. With no
   breadcrumb nothing is joined, and a squared corner under empty ground reads
   as a mistake rather than as a joint — the one shape on the screen with a
   flat corner and no reason for it. So `record-route` (client ruling: that
   route has no breadcrumb at all) and every other trail-less screen keep the
   full radius on all four corners.

   THE ASIDE COLUMN — the rail's mirror, split in two the same way the

   CLIENT, 2026-09-03: "Assistant (the name) should be a folder tab, like the
   breadcrumbs — then the full container for the assistant would be aligned
   with the main one." Before this the whole column was one padded box
   (`p-[var(--aside-inset)]` on every side) with the caller's panel dropped
   straight in — no furniture of its own, which is why it never lined up with
   the content column: `--aside-inset` and `--shell-gutter` are the SAME
   token at every density (see `DENSITY_ASIDE`/`DENSITY_GUTTER` below), but
   the content column spends its copy as `py` on the COLUMN itself, one level
   above the breadcrumb, while the aside used to spend its copy as `p` one
   level BELOW the dock — so the aside's panel sat a whole tab's height
   higher than the card, before either column ever grew a tab.

   TWO REGIONS NOW, so the tab can own the top edge the way the breadcrumb
   does: `ASIDE_TAB` pays the block-start only — no block-end, because the
   tab strip owns its own overlap (`--folder-tab-overlap`) exactly as
   `screen-shell-breadcrumb` above does — and `ASIDE_BODY` pays the
   block-end, no block-start, because the strip's negative margin already
   closes that gap. Split this way, the two columns' tabs start at the same
   measured y (both are `--shell-gutter`/`--aside-inset` below the row they
   share) and the two containers start at the same y below them (both
   `tab height − overlap` further down) — proven in `verify/shell-chat/`
   (`asideTab`/`asideBody` rects against `breadcrumb`/`card`).

   NEITHER REGION PAYS ITS OWN INLINE SIDES ANY MORE — CLIENT, 2026-09-03,
   ITEM 5: "there's way too much space between the content and the
   assistant", confirmed on every screen. `screen-shell-aside-dock` (below)
   already spends `--shell-gutter` getting from the card to this column,
   the SAME measure `screen-shell-breadcrumb`'s own dock spends getting from
   the rail to the CARD — and the breadcrumb pays no second inset of its own
   once it is there, it sits flush at the column's edge. `ASIDE_TAB`/
   `ASIDE_BODY` used to ALSO spend `--aside-inset` on top of the dock's
   gutter, `px-[var(--aside-inset)]` on both, and because `--aside-inset`
   and `--shell-gutter` are the same token (see above), that is the same
   number spent twice — 45px of air between the card and the assistant's own
   folder tab/panel where the card's every other neighbour (the rail, the
   ground on every other side) gets 22.5. Measured in `verify/shell-chat/`:
   the aside dock's own column started 22.5 past the dock's inner edge before
   this line, 0 after it — the panel and its tab now start flush at the
   dock's edge, the same way the breadcrumb starts flush at the content
   column's. `BreadcrumbFolders` (inside `ASIDE_TAB`) keeps its own internal
   tab padding (`px-5`) regardless — that is the label's OWN breathing room,
   never this column's, exactly as it already is for the content trail. */
const ASIDE_TAB = cn("pt-[var(--aside-inset)]");
const ASIDE_BODY = cn("pb-[var(--aside-inset)]");

/* How much air each door spends. Structure is identical; only the inset moves.

   THE RAIL'S INSET IS NOW `--shell-gutter`'s OWN VALUE AT BOTH DENSITIES, AND
   THAT IS THE SECOND HALF OF A CHANGE THAT WAS LEFT HALF-DONE ON 2026-09-03.

   CLIENT, 2026-09-06, VERBATIM: *"there's too much margin from sidebar to
   content, make it slimmer, same as weverywhere else"*. The operative clause
   is the last one. "Everywhere else" is not a mood, it is a NUMBER: the air
   between the card and the window on its other three sides, between the card
   and the assistant, between the assistant and the window — all of it is one
   token, `--shell-gutter`, and all of it measures 18.75 at the kit's own 15px
   root. Whatever the sidebar's edge ends up being, if it is not 18.75 it is
   not "the same as everywhere else".

   MEASURED BEFORE THIS CHANGE, at 1440 x 900, comfortable, expanded rail: the
   rail's own items ended at x 172.5 and the card began at x 213.75 — 41.25 of
   air, made of TWO numbers doing one job. `--rail-inset` (22.5) held the rail's
   items off the column's trailing edge, and then the dock spent
   `--shell-gutter` (18.75) again getting from that same edge to the card. The
   viewer cannot see the seam between them, because the rail column paints
   NOTHING at all (`background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)`, measured) — the mango
   a reader sees behind the rail is the SPINE, on the screen, which runs under
   both. So the two insets read as one 41.25 margin against an 18.75 one
   everywhere else, which is exactly the complaint.

   THE DOCK'S TRAILING GUTTER IS THE ONE THAT GOES (see the rail dock, below)
   AND THIS LINE IS WHY THAT ALONE WAS NOT ENOUGH. Dropping the dock's gutter
   leaves the gap at whatever `--rail-inset` is, and `--rail-inset` was 22.5 —
   slimmer, but still not the number the second half of the sentence names. Two
   values that are nearly the same, one of them 20% larger, is the condition
   that produced the complaint in the first place.

   AND IT IS NOT A NEW NUMBER OR A NEW TOKEN — IT IS THE STEP `DENSITY_GUTTER`
   ALREADY TOOK AND THE RAIL WAS LEFT OUT OF. Read that block below: on
   2026-09-03 the gutter moved from `--space-6` to `--space-5` on the owner's
   "same margins everywhere", and its own comment still asserts the rail's
   inset "IS the same `--space-6` / `--space-5` pair". That sentence stopped
   being true the moment the gutter stepped and the rail did not — the two had
   been one rhythm and the step split them, which is precisely the 22.5-against-
   18.75 mismatch measured above. So this is the same one-rung step, on the
   same scale already in `tokens.css`, applied to the value that was missed.

   COMFORTABLE NOW EQUALS CALM ON THIS PROPERTY TOO, exactly as it already does
   on the gutter, and for the same reason: whether the two densities should
   diverge again lower down the scale is a separate call the owner has not
   made, so calm is untouched and both read `--space-5`.

   WHAT THE RAIL LOSES BY IT, honestly: its content box grows from 150 to 157.5
   wide in a 195 column, so a truncating destination label gets 7.5px more room
   — a gain, not a loss. Nothing in `rail.tsx` writes a width, and its rows all
   fill the column's content box, so there is nothing to re-derive there. */

/* THE GROUND'S OWN GUTTER — the air between the card and everything around
   it, and the strip a shut aside's handle stands in.

   IT IS NOT A NEW NUMBER: it is the same `--space-6` / `--space-5` pair the
   rail's inset already spends, so the air outside the card and the air inside
   the rail are the same measure and the window reads as one rhythm.

   STEPPED DOWN ONE RUNG ON 2026-09-03, COMFORTABLE ONLY. Owner, on the live
   product: "this margin between navbar and content — so reduce the spacing
   there", said in the same breath as the ruling above it ("same margins
   everywhere") — read together, the ONE shared value was too big, not just
   the rail edge she happened to name, and shrinking only that edge would
   have broken the uniformity the sentence before it asked for. So the token
   itself moves, one step on the scale already in `tokens.css` (`--space-6`,
   24, down to `--space-5`, 20) rather than an invented pixel value, and it
   moves at every one of the gutter's call sites at once — the rail-to-content
   gap, the card's own four sides, the content-to-assistant gap and the new
   assistant-to-window edge (see the aside dock, below) all read the same
   smaller number after this line, because they were always one token.

   COMFORTABLE NOW EQUALS CALM ON THIS ONE PROPERTY, AND THAT IS AS FAR AS
   THIS CHANGE GOES. Calm was already `--space-5`; nothing here says whether
   it should step down again to keep a gap between the two densities — that
   is a separate call the owner has not made, so calm is untouched.

   MEASURED, at the kit's own 15px root (ruling 18, not ruling 28's 16px
   authoring reference): both densities now spend `--space-5` = 18.75. The
   handle's target is a fixed 20px, so both densities now carry the 1.25
   overhang onto the outermost 1.25px of the card's own rounded corner
   region (no content there to intercept) that used to be calm-only — see
   `verify/shell-chat/` for the measured before/after on both densities. */

   EVERY NUMBER HERE IS STILL THE CLIENT'S, AND EVERY ONE IS STILL WRITTEN IN
   px. THAT IS THE ONE PLACE THIS FILE DEPARTS FROM ruling 28's rem, AND IT
   IS ARGUED, AND THE RESKIN DID NOT REOPEN THE ARGUMENT.

   Ruling 28 authors against a 16px reference; tokens.css §1 then sets the
   real root to 15px (ruling 18), and `data-scale` moves it again — 13 at
   small, 17 at large. A rem-sized control shrinks with that scale — the
   ORIGINAL reason this handle never took `Button`'s own `size="icon"`
   (`--control-height-button`, 2.5rem: 41.25px at the default scale, 32.5px
   at small) — and shrinking is exactly the failure mode WCAG 2.5.5's
   target-size minimum exists to catch, for the reader most likely to have
   turned the scale down. So the circle keeps a LITERAL 32px, in both
   dimensions, which does not move with the scale, in place of the bar's own
   3 x 34 and 20 x 44 literals.

   Everything else the shell draws — the gutter, the insets, the radius —
   stays on the rem ladder, because all of it IS measure.

   It is a literal rather than a token for the same reason the bar was: none
   of it is on a ladder the kit ships, and there is no 32px rung to reach for
   instead of writing the number down.

   THE PHONE'S TOP BAR — THE ASSISTANT AND THE READER'S OWN FACE, IN THAT
   ORDER, ON THE GROUND, AT EVERY MOMENT. CLIENT-ORDERED 2026-09-04.

   HER SENTENCE, VERBATIM AND WHOLE, BECAUSE EVERY CLAUSE OF IT IS A
   REQUIREMENT: *"in mobile, put the ai assistant icon on the left of my
   avtara picture o top, visible all times"*.

     · "in mobile"        — below `md`, and nowhere else. Every class in this
                            section is `md:hidden` or lives inside something
                            that is. Desktop and tablet do not move.
     · "the ai assistant  — the Sparkle. It is the SAME control the corner
        icon"               handle was; it did not gain a second handler, a
                            second label or a second piece of state. See the
                            trigger below.
     · "on the left of my — DOM ORDER, not a physical side. The cluster is
        avtara picture"     laid out from the reading END, assistant first
                            and face second, so in LTR the icon is to the
                            left of the face and in RTL it is to its right,
                            which is what "left of" means to a reader of
                            Arabic and is the file's own standing rule ("no
                            physical side is named anywhere").
     · "o top"            — the ground above the trail, which is where the
                            menu control stood until this ruling replaced it.
     · "visible all       — not behind a menu, not inside the card's
        times"              scroller, not conditional on scroll position and
                            not conditional on state. The row is in normal
                            flow at the head of the content column, so it is
                            drawn on the first frame and stays drawn.

   WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY THE CORNER HANDLE HAD TO GO WITH IT. Until
   today the phone's assistant opener was `EdgeHandle`, shut, standing at
   `top-[var(--shell-gutter)] end-[var(--shell-gutter)]` — measured at 380 on
   2026-09-04 at x 323.75, y 18.75, 37.5 square. That is the SAME 37.5 square
   of ground this cluster now occupies, so leaving both drawn would have put
   two assistant openers on top of each other in one corner. The handle is
   therefore `max-md:hidden` IN ITS SHUT STATE ONLY (see its `placement`),
   which is the narrowest suppression that clears the collision: the OPEN
   state's handle is a mid-edge close grab against a column that is covering
   the top bar anyway, it collides with nothing, and removing a close
   affordance nobody asked to remove is not this pass's business.

   THE FACE IS THE RAIL'S FACE. It is not a second avatar concept and it must
   never become one: same `Avatar`, same `variant="brand"`, same
   `--spine-active-fill` / `--spine-active-ink` pair `rail.tsx`'s `MemberChip`
   spends, same `size="md"` (`--avatar-md`), same initials. 26.02 draws the
   foot circle as "the same fill and the same ink as the lit row above it" in
   all three spine specimens; a phone showing a different circle for the same
   person would be a second decision about one thing.

   AND THE NAME IS NOT REPEATED BESIDE IT. The rail's chip draws
   `givenName` next to the face because a 208-wide column has room for a word
   and 26.02 draws one; 380 minus two gutters is 342.5 of ground with a
   breadcrumb trail already competing for it, and the client asked for a
   "picture", not for a chip. The full name is still SAID — it rides in an
   `sr-only` span, or as the control's `aria-label` when the member is
   pressable — so the ear loses nothing the eye gives up.

   THE TWO CIRCLES ARE NOT THE SAME DIAMETER, AND THAT IS MEASURED AND
   DELIBERATE RATHER THAN UNNOTICED. The assistant is `Button size="icon"`,
   which is `--control-height-button` (2.5rem, 37.5px at the 15px root); the
   face is `--avatar-md` (2rem, 30px). Both are rungs the kit already ships
   and each is the RIGHT rung for what it is — the icon button is the size
   every other glyph-only control in this shell takes (the menu trigger, both
   handles, a collection's `+`), and the avatar is the size the rail draws
   this exact person at. Bending either to match the other would have made
   one of the two a number invented here. The row is `items-center`, so they
   share a centre line and the 3.75px difference reads as a face beside a
   button rather than as a misalignment. LOGGED AS OWED: if the client wants
   them identical, the honest fix is one ruling naming one diameter for
   "circular chrome on the ground", not a literal in this file.

   THE NARROW NAVIGATION — SECTIONS FIRST, THEN THE CHOSEN SECTION'S PAGES.
   CLIENT-ORDERED 2026-09-04, AND IT OVERTURNS A LAW THIS FILE USED TO STATE
   IN THREE PLACES.

   WHAT WAS TRUE UNTIL TODAY, AND WHY IT IS NOT ANY MORE
   `SHELL.md`, quoted verbatim in this file's header since the rebuild:
   "Drops the rail entirely — no hamburger is drawn anywhere in the kit."
   That sentence was obeyed exactly, and MEASURED IN A BROWSER at 380 x 800
   it produced this: rail hidden, rail handle hidden, aside hidden, aside
   handle hidden, `0` reachable navigation controls in the whole document.
   Not "fewer controls" — none. A phone could not move between screens and
   could not reach the assistant, on every screen in both doors.

   THE CLIENT HAS RULED THE OTHER WAY, AND HER SENTENCE IS A STRUCTURE RATHER
   THAN A PERMISSION. 2026-09-04, verbatim: *"now i want you to self manage
   preparing the app for other devices sizes / ipad and phone"*, and then,
   in the same breath, exactly what the menu is to be: *"i want that the
   navigatuin menu is with the navbar sections first, and the submenu with
   the pages."*

   SO THE "NO HAMBURGER" LAW IS NOT SIMPLY DELETED — IT IS NARROWED, AND THE
   NARROWING IS THE POINT. What that law was protecting against is a rail
   folded into a button ON A WIDTH THAT COULD HAVE HELD THE RAIL: a hamburger
   at 1440 hides navigation that had somewhere to stand, which is the failure
   `SHELL.md` names. Below `md` there is no such width — 380 minus a 208
   column is 172px of card — so the choice at that width was never
   "rail or hamburger", it was "menu or nothing", and this file spent a
   fortnight shipping nothing. THE LAW STILL BINDS AT EVERY WIDTH THAT CAN
   SEAT A RAIL: this trigger is `md:hidden` and there is no prop that can
   draw it wider. Desktop and tablet are untouched.

   AND IT IS NOT A FLAT LIST, WHICH IS THE HALF OF THE CLIENT'S SENTENCE MOST
   EASILY LOST. The obvious build — drop the rail's whole register into a
   drawer — was written first and rejected: the kit's own placeholder rail is
   two groups of four-and-three, a real workspace's is more, and a phone
   scrolling one undifferentiated column of every destination is precisely
   the "one long scroll" the client's wording rules out. SECTIONS ARE THE
   FIRST SCREEN. A section's pages are the second. `RailGroup.heading` is
   already the word for the first and `RailGroup.items` already the second,
   so nothing here is coined and nothing is a second source of truth: this is
   the rail's own register, re-presented.

   WHY IT IS A `Sheet` AND NOT A PANEL THIS FILE DRAWS
   Because every hard part is already solved there and solved once. `Sheet`
   is the kit's Radix-backed drawer: it carries `.motion-sheet` and
   `.motion-scrim` from `foundations/motion/motion.css` (law 6.1 — a
   component never writes its own duration or curve, and this file may not
   edit that layer), it traps focus, it closes on Escape and on the scrim, it
   portals out of the shell's own stacking contexts, and it renders NOTHING
   at all while closed — so "anything hidden must be genuinely unreachable"
   is true by construction rather than by an `inert` this file would have to
   maintain. A hand-drawn drawer would have re-derived five behaviours and
   got one of them wrong.

   `side="left"` IS THE READING-START EDGE, NOT PHYSICALLY LEFT — `Sheet`'s
   own header says so and positions it with `start-0`. The menu comes from
   the same edge the rail it replaces stands on, in both directions of text.

   THE TWO LEVELS SWAP; THEY DO NOT SLIDE. `.motion-panel-in` is the class,
   and motion.css's own words are the argument: it is for "a route that only
   swaps a panel inside a persistent shell … because the thing that moved is
   small". §8 in that file rejects horizontal panel travel outright ("sliding
   panels horizontally to imply a carousel is a lie about the information
   architecture"), and sections-to-pages is a drill-down, not a filmstrip.
   `.motion-row-enter` per row was tried and dropped for the reason §7 states
   itself: twenty rows each rising is a wave, and a wave is parallax in
   disguise. ONE class, on the level that changed, keyed so it re-runs.

 * A row in the narrow menu — a section on the first level, a page on the

 * three unrelated controls stacked on each other.
 *
 * `--control-height-input` (44) AND NOT THE RAIL'S `--control-height-button`
 * (40), AND THAT IS THE ONE PLACE THIS DELIBERATELY DIVERGES FROM THE RAIL.
 * The kit's own name for that token is "the touch row" (`button.tsx`,
 * `size="lg"`), and this surface EXISTS ONLY BELOW `md` — it is the one
 * control in the shell that is never operated by a mouse. Spending the touch
 * rung here is reading the ladder the kit already ships, not inventing a
 * phone number: WCAG 2.5.5's target minimum is the reason that rung exists
 * and this is the one place in the file that can actually honour it.
 *
 * THE TONES ARE THE PANEL'S, NOT THE SPINE'S, AND THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT.
 * The rail's rows read `--spine-ink` / `--spine-active-fill` because a rail
 * lies flat on the ground and the ground is the spine. This drawer is a
 * PORTALLED PANEL: `SheetContent` paints `bg-popover`, which is not on any
 * spine, so a `--spine-*` value in here would resolve against `:root` and
 * paint a rail's colours on a surface that is not a rail. `--surface-quiet`
 * / `--surface-selected` / `--ink-*` are the panel ladder, which is what
 * every other row on a panel in this kit already spends.

          RATHER THAN A TIDINESS ONE. It was written first as a plain
          `<Button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>` standing outside the
          `Sheet`, which LOOKED identical and MEASURED broken: Radix restores
          focus on close to `triggerRef.current`, that ref is only populated
          by `DialogTrigger`, and without one it is `null` — so choosing a
          destination dropped focus onto `<body>` and a keyboard reader
          started again from the top of the document. Measured in
          `verify/shell-narrow` both ways before the change; after it, focus
          lands back on this button.

          `asChild` SO THE KIT'S `Button` IS THE CONTROL, not a second
          button-shaped thing beside it — Radix's `Slot` merges the trigger's
          behaviour, its ref and its `aria-expanded` / `aria-haspopup` onto
          the element this file already draws. There is no `aria-expanded`
          written here for the same reason: Radix owns the state, so it owns
          the announcement, and a hand-written one would be a second copy
          that can disagree.

          `variant="secondary"` — A PAPER SQUARE, NEVER MANGO, AND THAT IS
          RULING 26 RATHER THAN TASTE. A screen gets one mango. Between `sm`
          and `md` the band's mango IS drawn (the trailing cluster returns at
          `sm`) while the rail is still absent, so a mango menu button would
          be two brand fills on one screen at a real width. Secondary
          re-resolves to `--spine-chip-fill` on the ground — see THE PAPER LAW
          — so the square reads on all three spines without naming a colour.

          `size="icon"` AND AN `aria-label`, WHICH IS 26.01's GLYPH RULE
          APPLIED HONESTLY: the kit's argument for a glyph-only control is
          that the glyph is unambiguous and the word is noise, and a menu
          glyph is the most conventional mark on the web. The label is
          therefore the control's ONLY name, which is why it arrives as a prop
          with a default rather than as a string in this markup — the
          application translates everything. */}

/**
 * The ground, the two flat columns, and the one card that floats.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — the spine ground; the rail flat on it; the breadcrumb
 *                      on it, joined to the card's squared leading corner;
 *                      the floating card with the header band — eyebrow,
 *                      title at its derived step, the identity chips under
 *                      it, the quiet line — then the figures and the body,
 *                      and the footer last when one is declared; the aside
 *                      when one is passed; an edge handle per column.
 *  2. hover          — the edge handles only, a fill swap
 *                      (`--btn-primary-hover`) on the kit's own colour
 *                      duration and curve, same as `Button`'s. Nothing else
 *                      here is pressable; the band's own controls, the
 *                      rail's and the body's own theirs.
 *  3. focus-visible  — tokens.css §8 rings every control at once, and the
 *                      control here is the handle's own 32px circle (the
 *                      button IS the mark now, so the ring rings the same
 *                      box it paints) and the band's own mango, which is a
 *                      `Button` and carries its own.
 *  4. active/pressed — none of the shell's. A handle's press MOVES the
 *                      handle, which is a louder answer than a 1px nudge, and
 *                      the band's mango is a `Button`.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply, anywhere. A shell is not a control,
 *                      and a region the reader may not see is ABSENT
 *                      (ch24.6): `rail={null}`, an omitted `aside`, an
 *                      omitted `onCreate` / `onEdit`, `actionsVisible={false}`
 *                      and `footerVisible={false}` all draw NOTHING rather
 *                      than something dimmed.
 *  6. loading        — NOT the shell's. Law 4: "a state is a body swap …
 *                      either way the rail, header and tabs stay drawn and
 *                      stay put." The shell is what stays put, so it has no
 *                      loading form of its own; `state` is forwarded to the
 *                      figure strip and to nothing else, and the body's own
 *                      state is `children`'s.
 *  7. empty          — same. An empty screen is a full shell with a register
 *                      in its card. A count of zero still renders as nothing
 *                      rather than "0" (`Badge`'s rule).
 *  8. error          — same, except the one exception law 4 names: a dead
 *                      session replaces the window, and a screen that does
 *                      that renders no shell at all rather than an empty one.
 *  9. rtl            — logical properties throughout. No physical side is
 *                      named anywhere in the file; the columns take their
 *                      edges from flex order, the handles from `start` /
 *                      `end`, and the card's one squared corner from
 *                      `rounded-ss` — start-start, not top-left — so the
 *                      mirror is free.
 * 10. dark           — every fill is a token. The ground is the spine —
 *                      #1C1B18 ink, #2F2D28 paper, #FED069 mango, which does
 *                      not move with the palette and must not — and the card
 *                      above it is #26241F, with `--shadow-lifted` at
 *                      rgba(0,0,0,.55) rather than light's .14 charcoal. Ink
 *                      measures 1.111, paper 1.127, mango 10.661. The thin
 *                      case is ink and paper, ~1.1–1.3 in both palettes
 *                      except ink-light (17.386 — see the file header's
 *                      "THE EDGE HANDLES" for the full six), which is what
 *                      the shadow exists for.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS — REWRITTEN 2026-09-04. Two of the three were wrong on a
 * real device and the numbers are in the file header's NARROW section.
 *  mobile  — NO RAIL COLUMN, but navigation is REACHABLE: a glyph-only menu
 *            control stands in the BOTTOM BAR under the card (`md:hidden`)
 *            and opens the sections-then-pages drawer. Client, 2026-09-04:
 *            "should only stay in bottom navbar" — it used to stand at the
 *            top-left and does not any more. The assistant is reachable too,
 *            and now from the TOP BAR: its trigger sits immediately before
 *            the reader's own face at the reading end of the ground, both
 *            drawn at all times, on her instruction. The column itself still
 *            OVERLAYS the card rather than docking beside it, so the card
 *            keeps the full width between the gutters. No title-row controls
 *            and no mango in the band; no footer. Every figure, every count
 *            and every identity chip stays: "drops controls, never counts".
 *  tablet   — the RAIL docks at `md` and the menu control disappears with
 *            it, because a width that can seat a rail must not fold one into
 *            a button. The ASIDE still overlays here: at 834 a docked
 *            assistant beside a docked rail left the card 249px wide, which
 *            is not a narrow card, it is a broken one. Both columns are only
 *            ever side by side from `lg`. The band's controls and the footer
 *            come back at `sm`.
 *  desktop  — the two-column form, unchanged in every measured particular:
 *            the aside returns to the flow at `lg`, the body's inset steps
 *            up at `lg`, and nothing else in this file moved.

    /* HAS THE ASSISTANT EVER BEEN OPEN? — A LATCH, AND IT EXISTS TO STOP A
       DARK FLASH ON EVERY PHONE PAGE LOAD. Added 2026-09-04 with the bottom
       sheet below.

       THE BUG IT PREVENTS, EXACTLY. The narrow scrim (see the aside dock) is
       a permanently-mounted element carrying `.motion-scrim` and this file's
       own `data-state`. `.motion-scrim[data-state="closed"]` is
       `motion-fade-out … both` — a real CSS animation, and a CSS animation
       RUNS ON MOUNT. So a scrim that is simply always in the tree plays its
       140ms fade FROM FULLY PAINTED on the first frame of every page load at
       380: a charcoal wash over the whole phone, once, on a screen nobody has
       touched. Measured before this latch existed, not suspected.

       WHY NOT THE OBVIOUS FIXES. Mounting the scrim on `isAsideOpen` alone
       kills the exit — motion.css §3b contract point 5, the one it says will
       be got wrong first: the element has to survive `--duration-exit` for
       the fade-out to play at all. `hidden` when shut is the same mistake
       spelled differently. Starting the scrim at `opacity: 0` and letting the
       animation win is a component writing its own motion, which is law 6.1.

       SO THE SCRIM IS NOT IN THE TREE UNTIL THE FIRST OPEN, AND IS IN IT
       FOR EVER AFTER. Before the first open there is nothing to fade out
       from, which is exactly the state the reader is in; from the first open
       onward both animations play on a mounted element, entrance and exit,
       for the rest of the session.

       IT IS NOT A BREAKPOINT AND IT IS NOT A `matchMedia`. It reads STATE,
       never width — the same value on a server render and on the first
       client render (`false`, or the caller's own `defaultAsideOpen` /
       `asideOpen`), so it cannot produce a hydration mismatch. The narrow
       scrim's own `hidden` / `max-[45rem]:block` pair does the width half in
       the cascade, where this file's house rule requires it.

       THE RENDER-TIME ADJUSTMENT IS DELIBERATE AND IS REACT'S OWN DOCUMENTED
       PATTERN for state derived from props ("adjusting state when a prop
       changes"). `toggleAside` alone would not catch it: `asideOpen` is a
       CONTROLLED prop, so an application can open the assistant without this
       component's handler ever running, and the latch has to notice that too.
       React re-runs this render immediately and commits once; nothing else in
       the tree observes the intermediate value. */

       in, and it is: what the call site said, then what the shell itself
       drew, then nothing.

       `rail === undefined` IS THE TEST, NOT `railNode`. The question this
       line asks is "did the SHELL build the rail?", because only then does
       the shell know what is in it — `RAIL_PLACEHOLDER_GROUPS` is literally
       the register the `<Rail />` two lines up is drawing, so the menu and
       the rail show the same thing on the ~44 screens that pass nothing. A

       TRUTHINESS, NOT `!== null`, SO THIS AND THE RAIL DOCK CAN NEVER
       DISAGREE. The dock below is written `{railNode ? … : null}`; a call
       site passing `false` (or any other falsy node) would otherwise get no

       different is the LAST rung, and it is different on purpose.

       `menuGroups` falls back to the rail NODE drawn flat, because a menu
       with the wrong shape is still navigation and a reader can still get
       somewhere. There is no equivalent degraded face: the only thing this
       file could substitute for an application's real person is the kit's
       fictional one, and a phone displaying "Member name / AC" over a real
       workspace's rail is not a degraded identity, it is a wrong one. So the
       third case draws NOTHING and `navMember`'s own doc says to pass it
       alongside `navGroups`.

       `!== undefined` AND NOT `??`, WHICH IS NOT PEDANTRY HERE. `navMember`
       is `RailMember | null | undefined` and the three values mean three
       different things — a person, "draw none", and "decide for me". `??`
       collapses the first two of those into one and would quietly turn the

            AS A SLOT: unlike `ambient` this is not a per-screen flourish a
            route opts into, it is a property of the shell itself, on every
            screen this shell ever draws.

            THE STACKING PROOF, NOT AN ASSUMPTION. `CursorGlow`'s own wrapper
            carries `-z-10` (see that file), which is a NEGATIVE stack level —
            CSS2.1 §E.2 step 2, painted before this SCREEN's own in-flow
            content (step 3+) and before every positioned descendant at
            stack level >= 0, which is everything else this shell draws: the
            rail dock and its `EdgeHandle` (`z-auto`/`z-10`), the content
            column carrying the breadcrumb, and the CARD itself
            (`relative z-[2]`, see the `CARD` comment below). A negative
            z-index inside THIS element's own `relative isolate` (the SCREEN
            div, immediately below) cannot ever paint above a z-0-or-higher
            sibling — that is what "negative" means in the stacking algorithm,
            not a convention this file has to maintain by keeping the glow
            first in the JSX. Measured in `verify/cursor-glow/`: the orb's
            resolved `z-index` is negative, the card's is positive, and a
            simulated `mousemove` over the card's own coordinates never
            changes the card's rendered pixels. Same guarantee `ambient`
            already relies on for this exact slot. */}

        {/* THE RAIL DOCK — the column PLUS the gutter after it, in one
            positioned box, and that pairing is what makes the handle's rule
            expressible in two classes.

            ═══ THE DOCK'S TRAILING GUTTER IS GONE, 2026-09-06 ═══════════════
            CLIENT, VERBATIM: *"there's too much margin from sidebar to
            content, make it slimmer, same as weverywhere else"*.

            The whole arithmetic and the ruling on which of the two numbers to
            drop is written out at `DENSITY_RAIL` above; what happens HERE is
            the removal of `pe-[var(--shell-gutter)]` from this line. The dock
            is now exactly its column: 195 wide expanded, the icon rail's own
            width collapsed, and the card begins at its trailing edge.

            WHY THIS GUTTER AND NOT THE RAIL'S OWN INSET, ARGUED RATHER THAN
            ASSUMED — because either one, deleted, would have produced a
            slimmer edge and only one of them is the redundant one.

              · THE RAIL'S INSET IS LOAD-BEARING ON FOUR SIDES. `--rail-inset`
                is the padding on `RAIL_COLUMN`, so it holds the rail's items
                off the window at the LEADING edge and off the top and bottom
                as well. Delete it and the rail's rows run into the window's
                own edge, which is the one thing every screenshot of this
                product has never shown. Delete only its trailing half and the
                rail is inset by one number on three sides and a different
                number on the fourth, which is the asymmetry this pass exists
                to remove. It also does real work the gutter cannot do: it is
                the padding the member chip's own pill sits inside, so the
                chip's leading and trailing air are the same measure.
              · THIS GUTTER WAS ONLY EVER THE SEAM. It separated the dock from
                the content column, and the dock's trailing edge is not a
                thing a reader can see: the rail column paints nothing
                (measured `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)`), so the "sidebar" a viewer
                perceives is the spine running under everything, and the seam
                lands in the middle of an unbroken ground. It was air between
                two invisible edges, spent on top of air that was already
                there.

            SO THE GAP IS NOW MADE BY EXACTLY ONE NUMBER, the rail column's own
            trailing `--rail-inset`, which since `DENSITY_RAIL` above resolves
            to the same `--space-5` `--shell-gutter` does. MEASURED at 1440 x
            900, comfortable, expanded: sidebar items end at 176.25, the card
            begins at 195, gap 18.75 — the same 18.75 the card keeps against
            the window on its other three sides. Collapsed: avatar ends at
            48.75, card begins at 67.5, gap 18.75. Before this change both
            measured 41.25.

            THE CONTENT COLUMN'S `md:ps-0` IS STILL RIGHT AND IS DELIBERATELY
            NOT TOUCHED. Its rule is "the inline gutters are paid by whoever is
            there to pay them", and the dock is still there paying this one —
            it is simply paying it out of the rail's inset now instead of out
            of a second inset of its own. Adding `md:ps-[var(--shell-gutter)]`
            back would restore the doubled 37.5 under a different name.

            ═══ WHERE THE HANDLE STANDS ═════════════════════════════════════
            NO LONGER A MID-EDGE GRAB IN EITHER STATE — see the `placement`
            below, which quotes the two client instructions that moved it and
            argues the boundary it is centred on. What is worth saying at THIS
            level is why the pairing described at the top of this block still
            matters after the gutter went: the dock is the handle's containing
            block, and now that the dock's trailing edge IS the card's leading
            edge, "the boundary a viewer sees" and "this box's end" are the
            same coordinate. The straddle is therefore expressible as an inset
            on this box, with no measurement and no second element. */}

                 TWO CLIENT INSTRUCTIONS, VERBATIM, AND THEY ARE ONE CONTROL
                 IN TWO STATES:

                   (2) "bring the ocntract sidebra button next to the avtara
                        card in sidebar, aligned horizontally but 50% inside
                        the navbar and 50% outside"
                   (3) "when contracted place he button avobe the avatra round
                        image"

                 So: EXPANDED it stands beside the member chip, on the seam
                 between the sidebar and the content, half over each.
                 COLLAPSED it stands above the bare round avatar, centred in
                 the icon rail's column. Both axes of both states are in this
                 one `placement` string, which is exactly what that prop was
                 made caller-owned for (see `EdgeHandle.placement`: "One
                 `placement` string, both axes, chosen by the caller from its
                 own state") — no second prop, no boolean meaning "but not
                 centred", no class fixed inside `HANDLE_HIT`.

                 WHAT THIS REPLACES. Until today both states were a MID-EDGE
                 GRAB: `top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2`, with `start-0` expanded and
                 `end-[var(--shell-gutter)]` collapsed — measured at 1440 x
                 900 with its centre at y 450, the viewport's exact middle,
                 beside a nav row and nowhere near the person's own face. That
                 placement said which way the column was about to travel and
                 nothing else. The client has asked for it to say WHOSE
                 sidebar it is instead, by putting it at the foot with the
                 member.

                 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                 WHICH x IS "THE BOUNDARY" FOR THE 50/50 STRADDLE
                 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                 The card's LEADING EDGE, and there is only one honest
                 candidate. "50% inside the navbar and 50% outside" is a claim
                 about what a reader SEES, and what a reader sees is not the
                 rail's box: `screen-shell-rail` paints nothing at all
                 (`background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)`, measured), so there is
                 no painted sidebar edge anywhere. The mango a viewer calls
                 "the navbar" is the SPINE, on `screen-shell-card`, and the
                 spine runs edge to edge under the whole window — under the
                 rail, under the gutter, and behind the card. The ONLY visible
                 line between "sidebar" and "content" on the entire screen is
                 where the card's own off-beige begins. So that is the line
                 the button is centred on, and half of it lies on the spine
                 and half of it lies on the card, which is what a reader will
                 read as half in and half out.

                 AND IT IS THE SAME COORDINATE AS THIS DOCK'S TRAILING EDGE,
                 which is what makes it expressible without measuring
                 anything. Since the dock's own trailing gutter came off (see
                 above), the dock ends exactly where the card starts — 195 at
                 1440 expanded, 67.5 collapsed. The dock is this button's
                 containing block, so `-end-[calc(--control-height-button/2)]`
                 pushes the button's trailing edge half its own width past that
                 line and lands its CENTRE on it. HALF THE BUTTON'S OWN SIZE
                 TOKEN, never a literal 18.75: `HANDLE_HIT` sizes the circle
                 with `--control-height-button`, so if that token ever moves
                 the straddle stays 50/50 by derivation instead of by two
                 numbers that agree today.

                 AND THE HALF THAT LIES ON THE CARD COVERS NOTHING THE CARD
                 DRAWS, which is the other half of "50% outside" and the half
                 that could have been a defect. The overhang is half the
                 button, 18.75; the card body's own leading padding is 30 at
                 this width (`DENSITY_BODY`'s `lg:p-[var(--space-7)]`), so the
                 button's trailing edge stops 11.25 short of the first pixel of
                 content — measured, and hit-tested at that content edge, which
                 returns the body and not the handle. The button is over the
                 card's own margin, never its content. It DOES lie over the
                 card's rounded bottom-leading corner, which is exactly the
                 effect asked for, and it paints above it: `HANDLE_HIT` is
                 `z-10` inside a `z-auto` dock, so it competes directly with
                 `CARD`'s `z-[2]` in the SCREEN's stacking context and wins.
                 `document.elementFromPoint` returns the handle at its centre
                 and at all four of its quarter-points, in every state.

                 REJECTED, AND WHY. (a) Centring on the rail COLUMN's trailing
                 edge — identical coordinate today, but only by accident: it
                 stops being the card's edge the moment anything is put back
                 between the two columns, and it is an edge nobody can see. (b)
                 Centring on the rail's CONTENT edge (where the chip's pill
                 actually ends, 176.25) — that is a real visible line, but it
                 is the line the client called "too much margin" one sentence
                 earlier, and straddling it would put the whole button inside
                 the gutter she had just asked to shrink. (c) Measuring the
                 card in an effect and positioning off it — forbidden outright,
                 and unnecessary: the two edges are the same box's edge.

                 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                 THE VERTICAL, EXPANDED — "aligned horizontally" WITH THE CHIP
                 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                 Her "aligned horizontally" means the two objects sit on one
                 horizontal line, i.e. their vertical CENTRES match. The chip
                 is the last child of a rail that fills this dock, so its
                 centre's distance from the dock's own bottom is arithmetic on
                 tokens and needs no measurement:

                     rail column's bottom padding          --rail-inset
                   + half the chip's height        --space-1 + --avatar-md / 2

                 `rail.tsx` states that height explicitly and states why —
                 "THE AVATAR NOW SETS THE HEIGHT and the `--space-1` padding
                 around it becomes real: 4 + 32 + 4 = 40" — so the chip is
                 `--space-1` twice plus `--avatar-md`, with no type in the
                 measurement since the client removed the role line. Take off
                 half the button's own height and that is its `bottom`.

                 IT IS WRITTEN AS THE WHOLE CALC EVEN THOUGH IT CANCELS TODAY.
                 At today's tokens the chip's height (3.75 + 30 + 3.75 = 37.5)
                 IS `--control-height-button` (37.5), so the two halves cancel
                 and the expression collapses to plain `--rail-inset`. Writing
                 `bottom-[var(--rail-inset)]` instead would be a third pair of
                 numbers that happen to agree — it would silently misalign the
                 day the avatar rung or the button rung moves, and the reader
                 who found it would have no way to know it had ever been a
                 derivation. The calc costs one long line and states the
                 relationship it is standing on.

                 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                 THE COLLAPSED STATE — ABOVE THE FACE, AND THE LANE IT NEEDS
                 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                 Horizontally the icon rail is a symmetric column and the
                 avatar is centred in it, so the button is centred in it too:
                 `start-0 end-0` plus `mx-auto`, which centres a
                 fixed-width absolute box in its containing block. NOT
                 `start-1/2 -translate-x-1/2` — that pairs a LOGICAL inset with
                 a PHYSICAL translate, so it centres in LTR and throws the
                 button a full width off in RTL, and this file names no
                 physical side anywhere. `mx-auto` is symmetric, so it is
                 direction-blind by construction.

                 Vertically it sits `--space-3` above the avatar's top edge:
                 `--rail-inset` (the column's bottom padding) + `--avatar-md`
                 (the face) + `--space-3` (the air between them) is the
                 button's own `bottom`. `--space-3` because that is the gap
                 the COLLAPSED rail already sets between its own circles
                 (`rail.tsx`'s nav takes `gap-[var(--space-3)]` when
                 collapsed), so the button joins the ladder that is already
                 there instead of introducing a spacing of its own.

                 AND THE ROW ABOVE HAD TO BE GIVEN THE ROOM — see
                 `MEMBER_HANDLE_LANE` in `rail.tsx`. A 37.5 circle dropped into
                 the collapsed rail's `--space-6` foot gap would have covered
                 26.25px of the last nav row, and a destination under an opaque
                 mango circle is a destination nobody can press. Measured with
                 a deliberately over-full rail (40 entries) on
                 `verify/rail-foot/`, in both cases, before and after. */

              READING END OF THE GROUND. CLIENT-ORDERED 2026-09-04; the whole
              sentence and every clause of it is quoted and answered at THE
              PHONE'S TOP BAR above, with the collision that forced the corner
              handle to stand down.

              WHAT USED TO BE IN THIS EXACT PLACE, AND WHY IT IS GONE. Until
              today this row was `screen-shell-nav-bar`: one glyph-only menu
              control at the LEADING edge, opening the sections-then-pages
              drawer. The client has seen it and redirected, verbatim: *"on
              mobile remove the section menu button from top left, should only
              stay in bottom navbar"*. So the control is REMOVED FROM HERE
              rather than duplicated — there is exactly one `NavSheet` in this
              file and it is now mounted in the bottom bar below the card. Her
              word is "only", and a menu reachable from two places on one
              screen is not "only".

              THE DRAWER ITSELF IS UNCHANGED AND THAT IS ALSO A RULING. She
              approved the sections-then-pages structure ("i want that the
              navigatuin menu is with the navbar sections first, and the
              submenu with the pages"); what moved is the button that opens
              it, not what it opens. `NavSheet`'s own argument, its trigger's
              variant/size/label rules and its two levels are untouched.

              WHY THE ROW ITSELF SURVIVED THE MOVE RATHER THAN BEING DELETED
              AND REBUILT. Everything the old block argued about WHERE chrome
              stands is still exactly true of this one and is not restated:
              it is on the GROUND, not in the card, because the band is inside
              the card and scrolls out of reach on a long screen at exactly
              the width where reaching matters; and it is a SEPARATE SIBLING
              above the trail rather than a wrapper around it, because
              `screen-shell-breadcrumb` may take no block-end padding and open
              no stacking context (the folder tabs' overlap and their z-order
              both depend on that), so this row pays its own `--space-3`
              beneath itself and touches nothing of the trail's.

              `md:hidden` IS STILL THE WHOLE GATE, AND IT IS STILL ON THE
              WRAPPER. Above `md` the rail is docked with the member's own
              chip at its foot and the assistant has its edge handle, so
              neither control in here has anything to do; the row is
              `display: none`, which is not merely invisible — it is out of
              the tab order and out of the accessibility tree, which is what
              "genuinely unreachable" means. Measured at 1440 and 834: neither
              takes focus.

              `justify-end` IS THE WHOLE OF "ON THE RIGHT", and it is logical
              rather than physical, so the cluster sits at the reading end in
              both directions. DOM order inside it is assistant, then face —
              which paints the icon to the LEFT of the picture in LTR and to
              its right in RTL, exactly as the client asked for in the one
              direction she reads.

              IT IS DRAWN WHENEVER EITHER HALF EXISTS, not only when both do.
              A screen with no assistant still shows the reader's face; a
              screen with no member still shows the assistant. Only a screen
              with neither draws no row at all, and then it costs no padding
              either. */}

                   said exactly that. `navLead` puts a second cluster at the

                   NOT SUSPECTED: with the assistant OPEN at 380 the dock is
                   `max-lg:absolute inset-y-0 end-0 z-[3]` and it spans the
                   whole 380 — so `document.elementFromPoint` at the centre
                   of this bar's assistant button returned the assistant's
                   own breadcrumb list, not the button. Both controls were
                   painted, both were in the tab order, and a TAP on either
                   went to the panel lying over them. The client's words are
                   "visible all times"; a control you can see and cannot
                   press is the worse half of that, not the better one, and
                   this button is the very control that CLOSES the thing
                   covering it.

                   THE LADDER, WHICH IS THE SCREEN'S OWN AND IS NOT EXTENDED
                   LIGHTLY: `CursorGlow` negative, the trail's rest tabs 1,
                   the card 2, the trail's live tab and the aside dock 3, and
                   now this bar at 4 — still inside the SCREEN's own
                   `isolate`, so nothing outside this shell is reordered.
                   Four is the first index over the dock and no higher.

                   IT IS A SIBLING OF THE BREADCRUMB, NOT AN ANCESTOR OF IT,
                   which is why this may declare a stacking context at all.
                   `screen-shell-breadcrumb`'s own block forbids a context on
                   THAT wrapper because the folder tabs' 1/3 indices have to
                   resolve against the SCREEN; this element sits beside it in
                   the same flex column, overlaps it nowhere, and traps
                   nothing of its.

                   UNCONDITIONAL RATHER THAN `max-md:`, because it is already
                   a no-op everywhere else: from `md` this row is
                   `display: none`, which has no stacking level to argue
                   about. One class that is always true beats two that have
                   to agree — the same reasoning the aside handle's own
                   `pointer-events-auto` is written with.

                   AND THE BOTTOM BAR DELIBERATELY DOES NOT GET THIS. It is
                   under the open panel at 380 by the same mechanism, and
                   that is a question rather than a bug: the assistant is
                   about to become a sheet rising to 85% of the height with
                   the top 15% left visible, which puts THIS bar in the strip
                   that stays and the foot of the screen under the sheet. So
                   the top bar is lifted because the client's sentence
                   demands it and the coming shape agrees; whether a reader
                   should be able to reach the section menu while the
                   assistant is open is hers to answer, and it is in the
                   report rather than decided here.

                   THE SHEET LANDED LATER THE SAME DAY AND THE PARAGRAPH
                   ABOVE IS NOW HISTORY RATHER THAN A FORECAST — kept because
                   it is the reasoning that put the 4 here, and the 4 is still
                   what makes this button pressable in the 720–768 band where
                   the bars have flipped and the sheet has not. BELOW 45rem
                   THE LADDER INVERTS: the aside dock takes `z-[5]` and its
                   scrim covers this bar along with everything else, because
                   the client's "make the 15% stay visible dut darkened" does
                   not have a bright rectangle cut out of it. The button is
                   covered, not dead — a tap on it lands on the scrim, and
                   the scrim closes the assistant. The whole argument, with
                   the alternative that was rejected, is at the dock's own
                   `max-[45rem]:z-[5]`. And the bottom bar's question is
                   answered by the shape: at 380 the sheet's foot IS the
                   window's foot, so the section menu is under it and is
                   reached by closing the assistant, which is one tap on the
                   scrim from anywhere in the strip. */

                  consuming app drew its own fixed `<header>` on phones for
                  as long as this shell had no mobile chrome at all — its
                  source said so in as many words ("ScreenShell has no
                  mobile-chrome concept of its own … the rail simply
                  disappears below `md`"). That stopped being true on
                  2026-09-04, and the two bars would have stacked: the app's
                  logo and face in one, this bar's assistant and face in
                  another, two faces on one 380px screen. Rather than teach
                  the app to suppress this row, the row takes what the app
                  had, and the app's bespoke header goes away. One bar, one
                  face, one place the client's "logo avatar and ai butto"
                  can all be true at once.

                  Rendered raw, with no wrapper of its own: the caller is
                  handing over a cluster it has already composed, and a
                  wrapper here would add a box it cannot see to reason about.
                  `min-w-0` on the row is what keeps a long workspace name
                  from pushing the face off the end. */}

              {/* THE ASSISTANT'S OWN CONTROL — THE SAME CONTROL, RELOCATED,
                  AND NOT A SECOND ONE. It calls `toggleAside`, the identical
                  handler the edge handle and the assistant's folder tab both
                  call, and it announces the identical pair of strings
                  (`asideOpenLabel` / `asideCloseLabel`, defaults "Open the
                  assistant" / "Close the assistant"). So a reader who meets
                  this button on a phone and the handle on a desktop meets one
                  action with one name, never two that can disagree — and
                  nothing about how the assistant PANEL is positioned or
                  animated is touched here. That is another pass's work
                  (`foundations/motion/motion.css` is not this file's to
                  edit); this is a trigger and only a trigger.

                  `Sparkle` IS THE ASSISTANT'S BRAND MARK, constant across
                  states — the same glyph the edge handle carries, for the
                  reason stated at `EdgeHandle.icon`: the state is announced
                  by the label, never by swapping the mark, so the icon does
                  not flicker between two shapes as the column opens.

                  `variant="secondary"` — PAPER, NOT MANGO, AND THAT IS
                  RULING 26 RATHER THAN A DEMOTION. The corner handle this
                  replaces spends `--btn-primary-fill`, which is the brand
                  fill; the FACE beside it spends `--spine-active-fill`,
                  which is that same mango on the ink and paper spines. Two
                  mango circles touching each other in one corner is two
                  brand fills on one screen, which 26.02 forbids, and of the
                  two the face is the one that cannot move — 26.02 fixes the
                  member circle as the lit row's twin in all three spine
                  specimens, and the client's sentence makes the picture the
                  anchor the icon is placed relative to. So the assistant
                  takes the ground's paper chip, which is exactly what the
                  menu trigger one file-section down already does and for
                  the identical reason. `--btn-secondary-fill` is rebound to
                  `--spine-chip-fill` on the SCREEN (see THE PAPER LAW), so
                  this reads correctly on all three spines without naming a
                  colour. LOGGED AS OWED: if the client wants the assistant
                  to be the phone's one brand fill instead, the change is
                  this one word plus a ruling that the top bar's face is
                  something other than mango — not one without the other.

                  `size="icon"` AND AN `aria-label` — 26.01's glyph rule, and
                  the label is the control's ONLY name, which is why it is a
                  translated prop rather than a string typed here.

                  `aria-expanded` IS WRITTEN BY HAND HERE, unlike the menu
                  trigger's, and the difference is where the state lives.
                  Radix owns the sheet's open state and therefore owns that
                  announcement; the assistant's open state is THIS file's
                  (`isAsideOpen`), so this file has to say it. It is the same
                  attribute `EdgeHandle` publishes from the same value. */}

              THE TOP-LEFT CORNER. CLIENT-ORDERED 2026-09-04, verbatim: *"on
              mobile remove the section menu button from top left, should only
              stay in bottom navbar"*.

              WHAT IS IN IT TODAY IS THE SECTION MENU AND NOTHING ELSE, AND
              THAT IS AN HONEST STATE RATHER THAN A FINISHED ONE. The client
              named the bar and named one thing that lives in it; she has not
              said what else belongs there. This file will not guess: a set of
              "primary destinations" invented here would be a product decision
              taken by a design kit, and it would be wrong in a way nobody
              could argue with because nobody asked for it. So the bar is a
              real flex row with a real gap and one item in it — adding a
              second is one JSX sibling and no layout change — and the
              question is asked out loud in the report instead of answered in
              code.

              `justify-start` WHILE IT HOLDS ONE ITEM, AND THAT IS THE
              DEFENSIBLE ARRANGEMENT OF A ONE-ITEM BAR RATHER THAN A HIDDEN
              PREFERENCE. The menu sits at the READING START of the foot,
              which is the same edge the rail it stands for occupies at every
              wider width, and it is diagonally opposite the top bar's cluster
              at the reading end — so the phone's chrome reads as
              start/bottom = where you can go, end/top = the assistant and
              you. Centring it instead was considered and is the shape a
              five-item bar wants, not a one-item one: a single glyph floating
              in the middle of an otherwise empty strip reads as an
              unfinished bar, while a glyph at the edge reads as the first
              slot of a row. Both are one class; the choice is the client's
              and it is in the report.

              IT IS IN NORMAL FLOW, NOT FIXED, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES
              "DOES NOT OVERLAP THE CONTENT" TRUE BY CONSTRUCTION RATHER THAN
              BY A COMPENSATING PADDING SOMEBODY HAS TO MAINTAIN. `PAGE` is
              `h-dvh` + `overflow-hidden` and the card's BODY is the only
              scroller, so a `shrink-0` row at the end of this flex column is
              pinned to the bottom of the window exactly as a fixed bar would
              be — and the card, which is `flex-1`, simply ends above it. A
              `fixed`/`sticky` bar would have painted over the card's last
              rows and needed the card to pay a bottom inset equal to a height
              this file would then have to know; measured at 380, the card is
              47.5px shorter with this row present and its bottom edge clears
              the bar by the `--space-3` this row pays above itself. Nothing
              is clipped and nothing is covered.

              `md:hidden` IS THE GATE, ON THE WRAPPER, for the third time in
              this file and for the same reason each time: above `md` the rail
              is docked and this row is `display: none`, which takes the
              trigger out of the tab order and out of the accessibility tree
              rather than merely out of sight.

              IT IS A `<nav>` AND THE ONLY ONE A PHONE HAS. `Rail` draws a
              real `<nav aria-label>` at its own root, and below `md` that
              whole subtree is inside `screen-shell-rail-dock`'s
              `hidden md:flex` — so a phone's landmark list had no navigation
              entry at all, and this element is now it. The name is
              `railLabel`, the SAME translated word the rail's landmark and
              the drawer's heading already carry, because three names for one
              region is three things to get wrong. Above `md` this element is
              `display: none` and the rail's own `<nav>` is the live one, so
              the two are never both in the tree and the name is never
              duplicated. */}

            dock — AND, OPEN ONLY, A SECOND GUTTER AFTER IT, which the rail
            deliberately does not carry.

            THE RAIL'S OUTER EDGE STAYS FLUSH ON PURPOSE (see `screen-shell-
            rail-dock`, above): the client's spine screenshots pin that edge
            to the window with no gutter at all, and this file leaves it
            alone. THE ASIDE'S OUTER EDGE IS A DIFFERENT RULING. Owner,
            2026-09-03, on the live product: "the same spacing that is at
            the bottom of the content and between the content and the
            assistant — I want it on the right of the assistant / so same
            margins everywhere." Today that edge is flush to the window with
            NO margin at all — the one edge of the card's whole neighbourhood
            that was not `--shell-gutter` — so `pe-[var(--shell-gutter)]`
            joins the dock's own `ps-[var(--shell-gutter)]` when the column is
            open, spending the SAME token a second time rather than a new
            number: card-to-assistant and assistant-to-window are now the one
            measure, exactly as content-to-rail and content-to-window
            (window-to-rail, rather — the rail's flush edge) already read as
            one measure apiece.

            IT IS CONDITIONAL ON `isAsideOpen`, NOT A PERMANENT CLASS, because
            the SHUT case has its own settled invariant one paragraph down
            ("the dock IS the gutter" — one `--shell-gutter`, not two) and
            widening it unconditionally would double the window-edge gap
            every time the column is closed, which nobody asked for.

            OPEN, the handle takes `end-[var(--shell-gutter)]`: the new
            padding sits OUTSIDE the handle's containing block's coordinate
            system (insets are measured from the padding edge, so `end-0`
            would still have landed at the window regardless of the new
            padding) — so the placement has to move in step with it, from
            the window's edge to the ASIDE COLUMN's own outer edge, one
            gutter in. This USED TO BE the identical formula the rail's own
            SHUT state read to find ITS column's edge past a `pe-gutter`, and
            THAT CROSS-REFERENCE IS RETIRED AS OF 2026-09-06: the rail dock no
            longer HAS a trailing gutter (the client's "make it slimmer, same
            as weverywhere else" — see `DENSITY_RAIL` and the rail dock above),
            so its column's edge and its dock's edge are now one coordinate and
            it needs no formula to step past anything. This aside dock still
            pays a `pe-` when it is open and so still needs one, which is why
            the line below stays exactly as it was — the two docks have simply
            stopped being the same shape, and a note claiming they still are
            would be the next reader's wrong lead.
            SHUT, the column is not rendered at all — zero width, no strip, no
            icons, client verbatim — so the dock IS the gutter, ONLY
            `--shell-gutter` (18.75–20px) wide with no buffer past it to the
            window's true edge, unlike the open case above.

            THIS IS WHERE THE CIRCLE GENUINELY CHANGED THE GEOMETRY, so it
            gets its own placement rather than the bar's `start-0`. The bar
            was 20px wide and the gutter was ~18.75–24, so `start-0` (pinned
            to the dock's card-facing edge, extending TOWARD the window)
            landed inside the dock with at most a sub-pixel spillage nobody
            could see. The circle is 32px — wider than the gutter at every
            density — so the same `start-0` would push its far edge PAST the
            window's true edge (measured: 13.25px off-canvas at 1440 wide),
            which is not an overlap, it is the button getting cropped by the
            viewport. `end-0` instead: the circle's WINDOW-facing edge is
            what is pinned now, flush to the true edge exactly the way the
            kit's own floating launcher is (`fixed right-4 …` in
            `web/components/agent-host.tsx`), and it is the card that eats
            the extra width, the same direction the old 20px box already
            spilled into by 1.25px — a floating round button sitting slightly
            over the card's own rounded corner is the shape a floating button
            is supposed to take, not a defect to hide. */}

                 the window's top and bottom edges. This dock paid only the
                 horizontal one, so the assistant ran the full height of the
                 viewport and its composer sat hard against the bottom edge,

                 first and pushed the whole column down 18.75px: the aside

                 the body's top level with the card's (47.33). A top padding

                 TWO CHANGES, 2026-09-04, AND BOTH ARE MEASUREMENTS RATHER
                 THAN OPINIONS.

                 WHAT THIS BLOCK USED TO SAY: `hidden … md:flex`. Two things
                 followed from it and both were wrong on a real device.

                 1 · AT 380 THE ASSISTANT WAS UNREACHABLE. The paragraph the
                     file header used to carry — "ch19 gives it a floating,
                     non-modal form that needs no column at all, and that
                     form is what a phone gets" — described a launcher that
                     lives in the APPLICATION (`agent-host.tsx`), not in this
                     kit. Every screen this shell draws therefore shipped a
                     phone with no assistant and no way to ask for one, which
                     is the same class of bug as the missing rail beside it.
                 2 · AT 834 IT DOCKED, AND THE CARD DIED. Measured on an iPad
                     viewport with both columns in the flow: rail 195 + aside
                     371 + gutters left the content card 249px wide. That is
                     not a narrow card, it is a broken one, and it happens at
                     the single most common tablet width there is.

                 THE MECHANISM, AND WHY THIS ONE AND NOT THE OTHER TWO.

                 · DEFAULT-CLOSED WAS REJECTED because it is not a guarantee.
                   `defaultAsideOpen` already defaults false; the 249px card
                   above was produced by a call site passing `asideOpen`, and
                   a rule an application can opt out of by accident is not a
                   rule. The card's width must not depend on anyone's props.
                 · A `Sheet` FOR THE ASSISTANT WAS REJECTED because the
                   conversation is a `React.ReactNode` this file was handed
                   ONCE. Rendering it in a drawer below `lg` and in a column
                   above it means either two mounts of a live conversation —
                   two scroll positions, two drafts, two streams — or a JS
                   media query deciding which tree exists, which is a
                   hydration mismatch waiting on the first server render.
                   The narrow NAV can be a sheet precisely because it is
                   built from DATA and holds nothing; the assistant cannot.
                 · SO: ONE MOUNT, ONE TREE, AND THE DOCK STEPS OUT OF THE
                   FLOW. `max-lg:absolute` is the whole mechanism. The column
                   is the same element with the same children at every width;
                   all that changes is whether it takes layout space from the
                   card or paints over it. No JS, no media query in
                   TypeScript, nothing to hydrate, and — because the classes
                   are `max-lg:`-prefixed rather than a `lg:` reset of an
                   overlay default — the cascade at `lg` and above resolves
                   to the identical `position: relative` in-flow flex item
                   this dock has always been. That last point is the reason
                   for the `max-` direction: desktop is not restored, it is
                   never left.

                 `inset-y-0` IS BLOCK-AXIS AND CARRIES NO SIDE. The file's
                 "no physical side is named anywhere" rule is about the INLINE
                 axis, which is what mirrors; `end-0` keeps this dock on the
                 reading-end edge in both directions, exactly as the in-flow
                 order does above `lg`.

                 `z-[3]` PUTS IT OVER THE CARD AND NOWHERE NEAR THE GLOW. The
                 card is `relative z-[2]` (see `CARD`), the breadcrumb's tabs
                 sit at 1 and 3 around it, and `CursorGlow` is negative. 3 is
                 one step over the card, inside the SCREEN's own `isolate`,
                 so nothing outside this shell is reordered.

                 `pointer-events-none` ON THE DOCK, `auto` ON WHAT IS PAINTED.
                 Shut, this box is still an `--shell-gutter`-wide strip lying
                 over the card's trailing edge; without this it would swallow
                 taps on whatever is under it — a table's last column, a row's
                 overflow control — for no visible reason, which is the worst
                 kind of bug to be handed. The column and the handle take the
                 events back. Above `lg` the dock is in the flow and overlaps
                 nothing, so it keeps events, and this whole line is absent
                 from the cascade there. */

              /* ── AND BELOW 45rem THE DOCK IS THE WHOLE WINDOW, BECAUSE THE
                 ASSISTANT STOPPED BEING A COLUMN AND BECAME A BOTTOM SHEET.
                 CLIENT-ORDERED 2026-09-04, three sentences in one breath:

                     "assistan is a slide up"
                     "everythung that's slisde in in desktop, should be slide
                      up in mobile"
                     "for slide up, make them 85% of the sccreen, make the 15%
                      stay visible dut darkened (like in desktop when we open
                      slide in)"

                 The third sentence is the specification and the parenthesis
                 is the acceptance test: the strip she wants left over is not
                 empty space, it is the SAME scrimmed page a desktop slide-in
                 already shows past its own edge. So this dock now has to hold
                 two things it never held — a full-bleed sheet and a scrim
                 over everything behind it — and neither of them fits inside a
                 gutter-wide strip pinned to the reading end.

                 WHY 45rem AND NOT `md`, WRITTEN DOWN BECAUSE THE TWO ARE 48px
                 APART AND THE FILE USES BOTH. In a media query `rem` is
                 always the INITIAL font size (16px) and never this kit's 15px
                 root, so `md` is 768px and `45rem` is 720px, and the band
                 between them is real. Everything the client's sentence is
                 about already draws its line at 720:
                   · `Sheet` flips a side drawer into a bottom sheet at
                     `max-[45rem]:` (components/sheet/sheet.tsx, NARROW_BOTTOM)
                   · motion.css §3a flips the sheet's own travel there
                   · motion.css §3b flips a non-sheet panel's travel there
                   · motion.css §3c, added for this panel, exists only there
                 Anchoring the GEOMETRY to `md` would put the shell 48px out
                 of step with the motion layer that moves it: between 720 and
                 768 the panel would have been a bottom sheet that still
                 travelled sideways, or a side column that slid up. One
                 boundary, four files, and the one already written into three
                 of them wins. The `md:`/`max-md:` rules elsewhere in this
                 file are about the phone's BARS, which is a different
                 question with its own settled answer, and they are left
                 alone — in the 720–768 band the top bar is drawn and the
                 assistant is still the side overlay it is today, which is
                 exactly what that band does now.

                 `max-[45rem]:start-0` IS THE WHOLE OF "FULL BLEED" and it is
                 an addition rather than a replacement: `max-lg:inset-y-0` and
                 `max-lg:end-0` are already true down here, so pinning the
                 remaining side is one class and the box becomes the viewport.
                 No `inset-0`, which would have restated three insets to
                 change one and left two spellings of the same edge.

                 THE PADDING GOES TO ZERO, AND IT IS NOT COSMETIC. An
                 absolutely positioned child is laid out against its
                 containing block's PADDING box, so the sheet's `inset-x-0`
                 and the scrim's `inset-0` would each land one gutter in on
                 every side while looking correct in the source. The client's
                 own arithmetic (85 + 15 = the screen) has no room in it for a
                 gutter. Each side is zeroed by name rather than with `p-0`
                 deliberately: Tailwind emits the `padding` shorthand BEFORE
                 the per-side properties, so a `p-0` would have lost to the
                 `pb-`/`ps-`/`pe-` above it at equal specificity and the bug
                 would have been invisible in the class list.

                 `max-[45rem]:z-[5]` LIFTS THE WHOLE DOCK OVER THE PHONE'S TOP
                 BAR, WHICH IS THE ONE GENUINELY CONTESTED DECISION HERE.
                 The bar is `relative z-[4]`, one step over this dock's
                 `max-lg:z-[3]`, and that was put there so its assistant
                 button stayed PRESSABLE under an open side panel — the exact
                 "visible but dead" defect that block describes finding and
                 fixing. A scrim at `z-[3]` would darken the whole screen
                 except a bright rectangle in the top corner, which is not
                 "the 15% stay visible dut darkened", it is 15% minus a hole.

                 So down here the ladder inverts and the scrim covers the bar
                 too — and the defect does not come back, because TAPPING THE
                 SCRIM CLOSES THE ASSISTANT. The button's own square of ground
                 still closes the assistant when it is tapped; what answers
                 the tap is the scrim rather than the button, which is the
                 standard bottom-sheet dismissal and is the behaviour of the
                 desktop slide-in the client's parenthesis names as the model.
                 The control is also still on the keyboard's path and still
                 announces "Close the assistant", so it is covered, not dead.
                 The alternative — keeping the bar above the scrim — was
                 rejected in the same breath as the hole: an undimmed cluster
                 floating over a dimmed strip contradicts the sentence that
                 asked for the strip.

                 FIVE IS THE FIRST INDEX OVER THE BAR AND NO HIGHER, and it is
                 still inside the SCREEN's own `isolate`, so nothing outside
                 this shell is reordered. The bar keeps its 4: between 720 and
                 768 there is no scrim and no sheet, and 4-over-3 is still
                 what makes its button pressable there. */

                2026-09-04 and it is the second half of one sentence, not a
                flourish: the strip of page the sheet leaves uncovered is
                REQUIRED to still be there and REQUIRED to be dimmed, and her
                own reference for how dim is the drawer scrim the kit already
                draws on a desktop.

                SO IT IS THAT SCRIM, TO THE CHARACTER. The colour expression
                is copied from `components/sheet/sheet.tsx`'s own `SCRIM`
                const — `color-mix(in srgb, var(--kw-charcoal) 28%,
                transparent)` — rather than re-derived, because the kit's
                drawer scrim is a stated value (`.kw-scrim--drawer`, charcoal
                at 28%, GAPS-A.md OVL-2) and two places computing it is two
                places for it to drift. `--kw-charcoal` is the raw palette
                layer and is reached deliberately for that file's reason: no
                semantic token stays charcoal in both palettes. Measured
                against a `Sheet` at 380 and it is the same colour and the
                same 28%.

                `.motion-scrim` AND `data-state`, WHICH IS THE WHOLE OF ITS
                MOTION. motion.css §3 fades it in over `--duration-overlay`
                and out over `--duration-exit`, matched to the panel beside
                it; this file names no duration and no curve, per law 6.1.

                `hidden` / `max-[45rem]:block` IS A PAIR RATHER THAN A `max-`
                PREFIX, AND IT IS THE ONE PLACE IN THIS DOCK WHERE THAT IS
                RIGHT. Everywhere else the default is the desktop's and the
                narrow rule is the exception, so `max-*` keeps the desktop
                cascade literally untouched. This element has no desktop
                behaviour to preserve — it is NEW, and above 45rem it must not
                exist at all — so the safe default is `display: none` and the
                exception is the one width that wants it. Written the other
                way round (`max-[45rem]:block` alone) a future change to the
                media query would leave a full-screen charcoal wash on every
                desktop.

                IT DISMISSES ON TAP, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING RATHER THAN
                CONVENIENT. Because the dock is lifted over the phone's top
                bar (argued at the dock's own `max-[45rem]:z-[5]`), this
                surface is what a finger meets where the assistant's trigger
                is painted — and it calls `toggleAside`, the identical handler
                that trigger, the folder tab and the edge handle all call. So
                the trigger's square of ground still closes the assistant when
                it is tapped, and the "visible but dead control" defect this
                file already found and fixed once does not come back through
                the scrim.

                `aria-hidden` AND NO ROLE, WHICH IS DELIBERATE AND IS NOT AN
                OVERSIGHT. A scrim is a pointer affordance and a redundant
                one: the assistant already has three keyboard-reachable
                closes — the top bar's trigger (still focusable, still
                announcing "Close the assistant" while it is covered), the
                folder tab inside the panel, and the edge handle above 45rem.
                Giving this box a fourth name and a fourth tab stop would make
                a screen reader announce a decoration; Radix's own
                `Dialog.Overlay`, which `Sheet` renders, is the same shape for
                the same reason.

                IT TAKES POINTER EVENTS ONLY WHILE OPEN. The dock is
                `max-lg:pointer-events-none` and what is painted takes them
                back, so this line is the taking-back — and it is conditional
                because a closed scrim is a fully transparent box over the
                whole viewport. `opacity: 0` does NOT stop hit testing; a
                permanently-live scrim would swallow every tap on the card
                for as long as the page was open, which is the worst bug in
                this block's neighbourhood and the reason the condition is
                written on the state rather than assumed from the fade.

                AND IT IS NOT MOUNTED UNTIL THE ASSISTANT HAS BEEN OPENED

                "that should minimize it with a nice animation."

                The column used to be mounted on `isAsideOpen` and unmounted
                the instant it flipped, so there was nothing left in the tree
                for an exit to play on. This wrapper is what stays: it holds
                the column at all times and collapses the track it sits in,
                `.motion-column-collapse` (motion.css §7) — the inline-axis
                twin of the row collapse, added for this, so the timing and
                curve stay in the motion layer where law 6.1 requires them.

                `inert` WHEN SHUT IS NOT OPTIONAL. A collapsed track is zero
                pixels wide and fully transparent, but its contents are still
                in the accessibility tree and still in the tab order — a
                keyboard reader would tab into a panel nobody can see, which
                is a worse bug than the instant disappearance this replaces.
                `inert` removes the whole subtree from focus and from the
                accessibility tree in one attribute, which is exactly the
                "shows nothing" the client's own earlier ruling asked for
                ("closed assistant show nothing, it's literally only the
                bar") — now true for a keyboard and a screen reader, not only
                for the eye.

                ONE THING STILL STEPS RATHER THAN EASING, said plainly: the
                dock's own trailing gutter (`pe-[var(--shell-gutter)]`, above)
                is dropped the moment the state flips, so the ~22px of air
                beyond the column disappears in one frame while the column
                itself eases away. It sits OUTSIDE this wrapper — moving it
                inside would either double the shut state's gutter or shrink
                the open panel's own width, both of which are measured
                properties other rulings depend on. A small step at the
                outermost edge, during a 140ms exit; logged here rather than
                left for someone to rediscover. */}

                 between them broke that: a block box does not stretch its

                   row. It is the same expression the column below spells as
                   `w-`/`max-w-`, which is the one duplication this approach
                   costs: Tailwind's arbitrary values cannot be read back out
                   as a custom property. Kept adjacent and measured together

                   IT MOVED OUT OF A `style={{}}` ATTRIBUTE ON 2026-09-04 for
                   one reason: it now has to differ by breakpoint, and an
                   inline style cannot carry a media query. The `lg:` line is
                   `min(23.75rem, 40vw)` unchanged — the same 356.25px the
                   inline value resolved to — so nothing above `lg` moved.
                   BELOW `lg` THE CAP IS THE VIEWPORT, NOT 40% OF IT, and that
                   is the whole difference. 40vw of a 380px phone is 152px: a
                   conversation in a 152px column is not a narrow assistant,
                   it is an unusable one, and the 40% cap only ever existed to
                   stop a docked column eating a WIDE card, which is a problem
                   that does not exist once the column stopped docking. So the
                   overlay takes the width it can have — the viewport less the
                   ground's own gutter on each side — and stops at 23.75rem,
                   which is still ch19's one stated assistant measure. */

                     THE GEOMETRY IS THIS FILE'S JOB AND NOT THE MOTION
                     LAYER'S. motion.css §3c says so in as many words
                     (contract point 4, inherited from §3b): the class travels
                     the panel, it does not place it. Placed wrong, the travel
                     would still be perfect and the destination still wrong.

                     `inset-x-0` + `bottom-0` + `w-full` AND ALL THREE ARE
                     NEEDED. `w-[23.75rem]` above is still in the cascade, and
                     an absolutely positioned box with `left: 0; right: 0` and
                     a stated width is over-constrained — the reading-start
                     inset wins and the sheet comes out 356.25 wide against a
                     380 screen, off-centre, with a stripe of card down one
                     side. `max-w-none` retires the narrow cap for the same
                     reason: the cap exists to hold an OVERLAY COLUMN one
                     gutter off each window edge, and this is not that any
                     more.

                     `h-[85dvh]` IS THE CLIENT'S 85, AND IT IS A HEIGHT RATHER
                     THAN A CAP. `Sheet` spells the same number
                     `max-h-[85dvh]` with `h-auto`, which is right for a menu
                     that should be as short as its contents; the assistant is
                     a conversation with its own scroller, so a cap would make
                     the sheet's height a property of how many turns had been
                     said and the strip above it would move as the reader
                     talked. She asked for 85 and 15, not for "up to 85".
                     `dvh` and not `vh`, `Sheet`'s own reason: a phone's
                     visual viewport shrinks under the browser chrome, and
                     `vh` would put the composer under it.

                     `rounded-t-[var(--radius)]` — the same corner, from the
                     same token, that `Sheet`'s `bottom` variant takes. The
                     radius is on the edge the page shows past, which here is
                     the top one, and only that one: the other three meet the
                     window.

                     THE SURFACE IS THE ONE THING THAT IS NOT MERELY MOVED,
                     AND WITHOUT IT THE WHOLE FEATURE IS A BUG. This column
                     paints NOTHING on a desktop by design — `ASIDE_BODY` is
                     "paper on the ground, painting nothing", because up there
                     it stands beside the card on the same ground. A
                     transparent box over the card is not a sheet, it is the
                     conversation and the card's own rows printed on top of
                     each other; measured at 380 before this line existed and
                     it is exactly that. `bg-popover` /
                     `text-popover-foreground` / `shadow-xl` are the three
                     `Sheet` itself spends (the kit's drawer surface:
                     `--popover` under `--shadow-overlay`), taken from there
                     rather than chosen here, so the assistant and every other
                     drawer on the phone are one material.

                     `.motion-edge-panel-narrow` IS THE TRAVEL, AND IT IS A
                     CLASS THAT DOES NOTHING ABOVE 45rem — the whole rule
                     lives inside that media query, which is what lets this
                     one panel slide up on a phone while keeping the inline
                     MINIMISE (`.motion-column-collapse`, on the wrapper) that
                     the client asked for by name on a desktop. It is
                     unprefixed here for that reason: there is no `max-` to
                     write, because there is no desktop rule to switch off.
                     See §3c for the three ways of avoiding a new class and
                     why each is worse.

                     THE PANEL IS UNREACHABLE BY POINTER THE MOMENT IT IS
                     CLOSED, not when the exit finishes. §3c's contract point
                     5 splits those two events on purpose, and this is the
                     pointer half of it — `inert` on the wrapper is the
                     keyboard and accessibility half and is already there. The
                     exit still plays: `pointer-events` is not a paint. And
                     once it has played, the animation's `both` fill parks the
                     panel at `translateY(100%)`, one whole sheet-height below
                     the window, where the SCREEN's own `overflow-hidden`
                     clips it — so a closed assistant costs no dead zone and
                     no scrollbar. Both are measured, not assumed.

                     WHY THERE IS NO `max-[45rem]:` HIDE ON TOP OF THAT. The
                     panel must survive the exit (§3c point 5) and it must
                     stay out of the tab order while it is gone — `inert` on
                     the wrapper does the second without touching the first,
                     which is the pairing that block already argues for. On
                     load, before anything has been opened, the wrapper is
                     `opacity: 0` with no transition to run on a first paint,
                     so the mount-time exit animation plays on an invisible
                     box and nobody sees the sheet fall past. That is the
                     wrapper's collapse rule doing a second job, and it is
                     written down here because it is not obvious and because
                     removing that `opacity` would break this. */
                  /* AND THE INLINE INSET HAS TO BE PAID HERE NOW, WHICH IS
                     THE ONE THING THE MOVE TOOK AWAY WITHOUT SAYING SO.
                     Above 45rem this column has no inline padding of its own
                     and never needed any: the DOCK pays it, one
                     `--shell-gutter` on each side (`ps-` always, `pe-` when
                     open), which is what holds the conversation off the
                     card and off the window. Zeroing those paddings so the
                     sheet could reach both window edges took the
                     conversation's own margins with them — measured at 380,
                     every turn started at x 0, hard against the glass. It is
                     `--aside-inset` and not `--shell-gutter` because this is
                     now the assistant's INTERNAL measure rather than the
                     ground's, and the two are the same value at every
                     density (see `DENSITY_ASIDE`/`DENSITY_GUTTER`), so
                     nothing moves and no new number enters the file. It sits
                     on the PANEL rather than on the body so the folder tab
                     is inset by exactly the same amount, which is the
                     relationship the dock's padding already produced above
                     45rem — tab and body flush with each other, both one
                     inset from the column's edge. The block-start and
                     block-end are already paid inside (`ASIDE_TAB`'s `pt-`,
                     `ASIDE_BODY`'s `pb-`) and are not doubled here. */

                    it carries, and a labelled generic is not a landmark — the
                    accessible-name-and-description spec attaches the name to
                    the element's own role, and `generic` has no landmark
                    mapping for that name to land on. So `asideLabel` was
                    always readable AT the assistant, never as an entry in a

                    though `screen-shell-rail`'s own wrapper is the identical
                    role-less-div shape — its landmark comes from the real
                    `<nav aria-label>` `Rail`'s own root draws one level in,
                    not from this shell's wrapper. The aside has no such inner
                    node — `BreadcrumbFolders` renders a `<nav>` of its own for
                    the tab, but that nav names the TAB ("Clients"), not the
                    panel — so the wrapper has to carry the role itself.
                    `complementary` over `<aside>`: this file's other levels
                    (`rail`, `card`, `body`) are all plain `<div>`s keyed by
                    `data-level`, and swapping element types for one of five
                    would make the shape read as an exception rather than a
                    role attribute doing its one job. */}
                {/* THE TAB — `asideLabel` drawn as ONE folder tab, through the
                    same component the content trail uses rather than a second
                    drawing of the shape. `label` reuses `asideLabel` too — the
                    landmark's name is the same word the tab shows, not a
                    second string to translate.

                    CLIENT, 2026-09-04: "i want to close the assistant by
                    clicking on its folder tab, that should minimize it." A
                    single, otherwise-read-only crumb is `BreadcrumbFolders`'
                    own "one tab, nothing to its left" state (its TEN STATES
                    #1) — but THIS tab is not a location, it is furniture that
                    doubles as the column's close control, so it now takes
                    that component's `onCurrentActivate` escape hatch instead:
                    the ONLY call site in the kit that does, added to
                    `BreadcrumbFolders` for exactly this. Every real
                    breadcrumb trail (the content column's own, above) never
                    passes it and renders BYTE-IDENTICAL to before this
                    change — see that prop's own doc for why a real trail's
                    "current page is not a link" law cannot be reached by a
                    call site that leaves it out.

                    `toggleAside` / `asideCloseLabel` ARE THE EDGE HANDLE'S
                    OWN — not a second pair invented for the tab. Both
                    controls flip the identical `isAsideOpen` state through
                    the identical handler, and both announce the identical
                    string ("Close the assistant" by default) while the
                    column is open, so a screen reader hears one description
                    of one action from either control, never two. This block
                    only renders while `isAsideOpen` is true (see the
                    ternary above), which is also why `currentActivateExpanded`
                    can safely read `isAsideOpen` directly rather than a
                    literal `true` — it is always true here, and stays
                    correct if that ever stops being so.

                    THE CLOSE IS ANIMATED NOW, AND THE PARAGRAPH THAT USED TO
                    STAND HERE IS RETIRED. It said there was no inline-axis
                    collapse in `foundations/motion/motion.css` to reach for
                    and that motion was a foundation this file could not edit,
                    so the toggle stayed an instant swap; both halves were
                    true when it was written and neither is now.
                    `.motion-column-collapse` (motion.css §7) was added for
                    exactly this ruling and is on the wrapper one level up —
                    "minimise" is the column's track easing shut on the inline
                    axis, which is the direction the client's own word points
                    in. BELOW 45rem THE SAME TAP DOES SOMETHING ELSE AGAIN:
                    the panel is a bottom sheet down there, so it falls rather
                    than narrows (motion.css §3c, and the geometry is on the
                    panel itself). One control, one handler, two shapes,
                    neither of them a duration written in this file.
                    `rail.tsx`'s own collapse is still unanimated and is still
                    a separate question nobody has asked.

                    UNPADDED AT THE BLOCK-END, same reasoning as
                    `screen-shell-breadcrumb`: the strip's own negative margin
                    (`--folder-tab-overlap`) is the whole attachment mechanic,
                    so padding here would be subtracted from it. */}

                 questions. OPEN, it is a close control belonging to the
                 column it sits against, so it stays where that column's own
                 edge is — vertically centred, the mid-edge grab every other
                 handle uses. SHUT, the column is gone and the button is the
                 only way back to the assistant; the client looked for it in
                 the screen's top-right corner and it was floating in the
                 middle of the right edge instead. So when shut it takes the
                 corner: one shell gutter down from the top, one in from the
                 end, the same inset the content column pays, which is what
                 makes it read as sitting in the page's corner rather than
                 stuck to its side. */
              /* `pointer-events-auto` TAKES THE EVENTS BACK from the dock's
                 own `max-lg:pointer-events-none` (argued there). It is
                 unconditional rather than `max-lg:`-scoped because it is a
                 no-op above `lg` — the dock keeps events there and this
                 element already inherits them — and one class that is always
                 true beats two that have to agree. */
              /* AND SHUT, BELOW `md`, IT IS NOT DRAWN AT ALL — ADDED
                 2026-09-04 WITH THE PHONE'S TOP BAR, AND IT IS A COLLISION
                 RATHER THAN A CHANGE OF MIND. The corner this handle takes
                 when shut (`top-gutter` / `end-gutter`) measured at 380 on
                 the build before this one at x 323.75, y 18.75, 37.5 square.
                 The top bar's assistant button now stands in that same
                 square of ground, and it is the SAME control — same
                 `toggleAside`, same `asideOpenLabel` — so both drawn is one
                 action wearing two buttons stacked on each other, which is
                 the client's own "should only stay in" objection to the menu
                 applied to the assistant.

                 `max-md:hidden` AND NOT A `hidden md:block` PAIR, so the
                 cascade at `md` and above resolves to the identical
                 unprefixed rules this handle has always had — desktop and
                 tablet are not restored, they are never left. Same `max-`
                 direction and same reasoning as the aside dock's own
                 `max-lg:` block one level up.

                 IT IS ON THE SHUT BRANCH ONLY, WHICH IS THE NARROWEST
                 SUPPRESSION THAT CLEARS THE COLLISION. Open, this handle is a
                 mid-edge CLOSE grab (`top-1/2`) against a column that is
                 already covering the top bar at 380, so it collides with
                 nothing and it is a second way out of a panel that fills the
                 phone. Removing a close affordance the client did not ask to
                 remove is not this pass's business — and the assistant's
                 own folder tab (its other close control) is still there
                 beside it.

                 `hidden` IS `display: none`, so the button is out of the tab
                 order and out of the accessibility tree, not merely
                 unpainted. Measured with the focus sweep, not with
                 `checkVisibility`. */
              /* AND OPEN, BELOW 45rem, IT IS NOT DRAWN EITHER — ADDED
                 2026-09-04 WITH THE BOTTOM SHEET, AND IT IS THE SAME KIND OF
                 COLLISION AS THE SHUT BRANCH'S, NOT A CHANGE OF MIND ABOUT
                 CLOSE AFFORDANCES.

                 THE BLOCK ABOVE ARGUES, CORRECTLY FOR THE SHAPE IT WAS
                 WRITTEN AGAINST, that the OPEN handle collides with nothing:
                 it was a mid-edge grab on the inline edge of a column that
                 ran the full height of the window, which is what a mid-edge
                 grab is for. The sheet has no inline edge. `top-1/2` at 380
                 puts this circle at y 406 — 40% of the way DOWN the sheet's
                 own face, floating over the conversation, pinned to nothing
                 and grabbing nothing. Measured: the handle's centre lands
                 inside `screen-shell-aside-body`, not on any edge of it.

                 THE ASSISTANT IS STILL CLOSABLE THREE WAYS DOWN HERE, WHICH
                 IS WHY THIS IS A SUPPRESSION AND NOT A LOSS: the folder tab
                 at the head of the sheet (`onCurrentActivate`, argued above),
                 the top bar's own trigger — still on the keyboard's path,
                 still announcing "Close the assistant" — and the scrim, which
                 answers a tap anywhere in the 15% including the square of
                 ground the trigger is painted on. That is one more than a
                 desktop has.

                 `max-[45rem]:hidden` RATHER THAN `max-md:hidden`, WHICH IS
                 THE ONE ASYMMETRY IN THIS TERNARY AND IS DELIBERATE. The two
                 branches are answering two different questions: the SHUT
                 handle stands down because the phone's TOP BAR took its
                 corner, and the bars flip at `md`; this one stands down
                 because the panel became a SHEET, and the sheet flips at
                 45rem (see the dock's own block for why that boundary and not
                 the other). Written with one breakpoint for tidiness, the
                 720–768 band would either lose a close control it still has a
                 use for or keep one that no longer points at an edge.

                 `hidden` IS `display: none`, so the button is out of the tab
                 order and out of the accessibility tree, not merely
                 unpainted — measured with the focus sweep, not with
                 `checkVisibility`. */
