   RecordRoute — `/t/[...path]` in the system app: the one dynamic record
   route, and the screen that proves the record chrome.

   THE SHAPES
   `ScreenShell` (the rail and the page frame, header slot left empty — see
   override 73 below) wrapping `RecordChrome` (shape 1) with `StepperHero`
   (shape 4) in its hero slot. `door="system"`, so the measure is
   `comfortable` and the progression is the seven-stage vocabulary (ruling 04).

   WHY THIS ROUTE MATTERS MORE THAN THE OTHER TEN
   The record chrome applies to fourteen screens across the two doors. Every
   one of them is this file with a different `kind`, a different tab set and
   different facts — a ticket, a story, a sprint, a task, a process, a
   purpose, a meeting, a time entry, and their portal twins. If the four
   regions are right here they are right in all fourteen; if they are wrong
   here they are wrong fourteen times.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 27.8 (record detail), 27.13 (tabs) and
   chapter 23 (the record hero with the stages in it).

     ch27.8, the region order, verbatim:
       "Breadcrumb, then the identity row — record number in the charcoal
        pill, status, relation, since — then the title on its own line, then
        tags beneath it. Keys sit above because they tell you which record
        this is before you read what it's called; tags sit below because they
        describe it afterwards. Facts strip, the record's own text,
        attachments, then the ink footer. That order never changes."

     REVERSED BY OVERRIDE 73 (2026-08-26) — SEE `record-chrome.tsx`'S HEADER
     FOR THE CLIENT'S VERBATIM RULING. There is no breadcrumb on this route
     any more, and the identity row moves BELOW the title instead of above
     it. That override is what moved this route OFF `DetailScreen` and back
     onto `ScreenShell` + `RecordChrome` directly, which is the second, load-
     bearing change in this file: `DetailScreen` draws its own breadcrumb,
     eyebrow and title in `ScreenShell`'s header band — a region entirely
     apart from `RecordChrome`'s identity row in the body pane below — and
     that split is what produced the exact bug the client's screenshot
     showed: a breadcrumb-plus-eyebrow bar, a gap, then the ID chip and Edit
     on their own row far below. `RecordChrome` now carries `title` itself
     (see override 73's own comment for why that also puts Edit "aligned
     with the title" for free), so this route no longer needs a separate
     header band at all — `ScreenShell`'s `header` slot is left empty and
     everything the record needs to say lives in `RecordChrome`'s body pane.
     `segments`, `breadcrumb` and `breadcrumbLabel` are removed from this
     route's own props with the same reasoning override 73 used for
     `RecordChrome`'s API: nothing renders a breadcrumb on a record screen
     any more, and the one caller of this route in the demo
     (`demo/routes/system-s-t.tsx`) never passed them.

     ch27.8 on what the ink footer holds, verbatim: "Latest activity on the
       left — a short reverse-chronological feed with an add-a-note field —
       and Record on the right, two to four key/value rows."

   THE FOOTER'S FEED IS NOT THE ACTIVITY TAB. Both are this record's history
   and they are two props on purpose: `activity` is the TAB and holds all of
   it, `latest` is the footer's left column and holds the newest few, which is
   the chapter's own word — "a SHORT reverse-chronological feed". One prop
   feeding both would put the whole history in a summary card or two lines in
   a tab, and neither is what 27.8 draws.

   THE NOTE FIELD IS THE SYSTEM DOOR'S, AND IT IS THE APPLICATION'S TO WIRE.
   ch27.8 draws it on a record like this one, so the route offers it — but it
   appears only when a handler arrives, because a field that accepts a note
   nothing stores is worse than no field. No handler is defaulted here: where
   a note goes is the application's fact, not a screen's. The portal door
   never gets one at all, and `RecordChrome` warns if it is handed one.

     ch27.8 on what the page is FOR, verbatim: "The detail screen is for
       reading … Everything that changes the record happens in the slide-in
       from 27.3, so this page never contains a form."

     ch27.13, verbatim: "A record's sections — Overview, Activity, Files — use
       the underline strip with a quiet count, never the folder shape. Folder
       tabs belong to collections and main screens only; inside a record they
       would claim the page is a different collection."

     ch23 on the one mango, verbatim: "The current stage carries the only
       mango in the hero, so Edit drops to the paper secondary when a stage is
       highlighted. Two mangos in one header is the most common way this
       composition goes wrong."

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · THE PROGRESSION IS DRAWN ONCE. `RecordChrome` has a `stages` slot of its
     own AND a `hero` slot. Passing both would draw two steppers on one
     screen, so this route passes the stages to `StepperHero` and leaves
     `RecordChrome`'s own slot empty. One progression, one hero.
   · EDIT IS THE PAPER SECONDARY (ch23). Whenever the hero is drawn with a
     current stage — which is every ready render of this route — the mango
     belongs to that stage and the header's Edit steps down. It is computed,
     not remembered: `stagesShown` decides it.
   · NO FORM ON THIS PAGE (ch27.8). There is no field, no save and no dirty
     state in this file. Edit is a handler the route hands upward.
   · THE TAB SET IS THE UNDERLINE STRIP (ch27.13), and the counts are quiet.
   · A STATE SWAPS THE PANEL, NEVER THE FRAME (ch27 law 4). The identity row,
     the title, the hero and the strip stay drawn through loading, empty and
     error, because the route already knows them.
   · DESTRUCTIVE NEVER GETS A BUTTON (ch27.8). Archive and delete are the
     route's overflow, not a control drawn here.
   · EVERY USER-FACING STRING IS A PROP (PATTERN §7), including all seven
     stage labels — see the note on `SYSTEM_STAGES` below.
   · No fill, no radius, no ring and no type step is written in this file.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. The tab handler and the stage handler are built during this
   module's own render.
