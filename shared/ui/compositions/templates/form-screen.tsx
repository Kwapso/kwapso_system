/* ============================================================================
   FormScreen — the one shell every form in both apps renders through. Either
   a panel over the work, or the full content area.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 27.2 (add form), 27.3 (record edit), 27.35
   (validation), 27.30 / 27.38 (the full-width variants) and chapter 09.

     ch27.2 on where a form lives, verbatim:
       "Creating a record slides a panel in from the right over the collection
        you were reading — from the bottom on a phone — while the page behind
        blurs back and stops responding. It still has its own URL, so a
        half-finished record survives a reload. Centred modals are for
        confirmations only."

     ch27.2 on the inside of the panel, verbatim:
       "No cards inside the panel — the panel is the sheet. Fields are
        off-beige fills laid directly on it, and a group starts with a hairline
        and an uppercase eyebrow, nothing more. Required group first, optional
        second, never mixed; a form with one group has no eyebrow at all.
        Stacked cards inside a form read as several forms and are not used
        here."

     ch27.2 on the footer, verbatim:
       "Filling a form means scrolling down, so the buttons are where the
        scrolling ends: a footer pinned to the panel's bottom edge, same paper
        as the form, separated by one hairline — no second tone. One order
        everywhere … the hint or reference against the left edge, then Cancel,
        then Create. The header carries the title and one ✕, never a commit."

     ch27.2 on why the footer states the reason, verbatim:
       "A field is checked when it loses focus, and its message sits under that
        field. But the commit is where the scrolling ends, so the footer
        carries the reason too … 'Two required fields are empty — Title,
        Owner'. Nobody should reach the bottom of a long form and have to
        guess."

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · NO CARD INSIDE A FORM. Groups are `FormSection`, which is a fieldset with
     an eyebrow and a hairline — never a `Card`. ch27.2 forbids the stack.
   · THE FOOTER IS PINNED IN A PANEL AND FLOWS ON A PAGE. In panel mode the
     commit sits in the sheet's own footer and is bound to the form by `form=`,
     so it stays visible while the fields scroll. On a page the form's own
     `FormActions` carries it, in the flow, where the scrolling ends.
   · CONTEXT LEFT, PRIMARY LAST. `FormActions` is end-aligned with the primary
     last, and the missing-field sentence rides the `meta` slot on the left.
     That is both ch27.2's order and this repo's own settled ruling.
   · THE TITLE IS IN THE HEADER, NEVER A SECOND TIME. In panel mode the title
     goes to `SheetTitle` and the form draws none, so a reader never meets the
     same heading twice.
   · A DISABLED COMMIT STATES ITS CONDITION. `missing` produces the sentence
     beside the button rather than a tooltip on it.
   · Focus is one global rule. No ring, no radius, no fill written here.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. `useId`, Radix Sheet, and submit handlers built during this
   module's own render.

/**
 * The one form shell.

 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — title, groups, footer.
 *  2. hover          — owned by the fields and the buttons.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *  4. active/pressed — owned by `Button`.
 *  5. disabled       — `disabled` freezes the whole form through `Form`'s one
 *                      `<fieldset disabled>`; every control then draws its own
 *                      fill and ink. Never an opacity.
 *  6. loading        — `submitting` keeps the commit's fill and grows a
 *                      spinner (PATTERN §4); `state="loading"` unfills the body
 *                      while the record is being fetched.
 *  7. empty          — `state="empty"`: a form with no fields for this reader.
 *                      ch24.6 hides rather than disables, so this is a real
 *                      case and not a placeholder.
 *  8. error          — two kinds, kept apart: `errors` is per-field validation
 *                      with a summary, `state="error"` is ruling 06's block
 *                      failure where the form could not be built at all.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply to the shell.
 * 10. read-only      — pass `disabled` with no `onSubmit`: the values are
 *                      readable and nothing commits.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — chapter 09's one stated form breakpoint is
 *  48rem, and `Form`'s own grid owns it: one column below, two above, never
 *  three. In panel mode `Sheet` rises from the bottom on a phone, which is
 *  `sheetVariants`' own behaviour and not re-decided here.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling. `"right"` is the physical value the sheet
 * primitive takes; with RTL out of scope it is the inline end. At narrow the
 * panel is a bottom sheet instead (27.32, ruling W1), which has no side at all.
