   MultiStepForm — CH27.38, "Multi-step form · For decisions with
   consequences, not for long forms".

   COMPOSED, NOT DRAWN
     · StepperHero  — shape 4, the same rail onboarding and import already use.
                      CH27.38 requires exactly that: "All three multi-step
                      things in the system — onboarding, import, this — use the
                      same left rail and the same button order."
     · FormScreen   — shape 5 at `surface="page"`. It owns the title, the body
                      column, the meta line above the buttons and the Back /
                      Next pair.
     · Choice + Checkbox — the kit's selection control, for a step that picks.
   Not one fill, radius, ring or type step is written in this file.

   DESIGN SOURCE — KWAPSO-SPEC.md CH27, composition 27.38.

     The strapline, verbatim:
       "Planning a sprint, closing a month, moving an account onto a new
        contract. A form becomes a wizard only when a later step depends on an
        earlier one — never to make twelve fields feel shorter."

     "Three steps, or it is a form", verbatim:
       "A wizard is allowed at three steps and no more. If the steps do not
        depend on each other it is one panel with groups of fields (27.2) —
        splitting a flat form into pages only hides its length."

     "The rail carries a summary", verbatim:
       "Completed steps collapse into one line of prose with 'Change' beside
        them, so the decisions already made stay readable while the current one
        is being made."

     "Every step states its arithmetic", verbatim:
       "Three tickets, 26h of the 40h booked. A wizard exists because the steps
        interact, so each step shows the consequence of what has been picked —
        otherwise the split earns nothing."

     "Nothing exists until the last step", verbatim:
       "Said in the rail and under the buttons. The sprint appears on the
        timeline when it is opened, not while it is being planned, so an
        abandoned wizard leaves no ghost record."

     "Back never loses a step", verbatim:
       "Moving back keeps every value; the step rail is clickable for completed
        steps. There is no 'you will lose your progress' dialog inside a wizard
        — only on closing it entirely (ruling 11)."

     "It is a page, like import and onboarding", verbatim:
       "Full content area, rail and header intact, no dim."

     Narrow, verbatim: "Narrow · one step per screen, the summary above the
       buttons".

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · THREE STEPS AND NO MORE. `MAX_WIZARD_STEPS` is 3 and a fourth warns in
     development rather than being drawn. A flat form is `FormScreen` on its
     own; this composition is not the way to shorten one.
   · A LATER STEP MUST DEPEND ON AN EARLIER ONE. `dependsOnEarlierStep` is a
     required prop with no default, so a call site has to answer the chapter's
     question before it can render a wizard; `false` warns in development.
   · NOTHING EXISTS UNTIL THE LAST STEP, SAID TWICE. Once in the rail's summary
     and once in the meta line above the buttons — the chapter's own "Said in
     the rail and under the buttons".
   · THE RUNNING SUMMARY IS PROSE WITH "CHANGE" BESIDE IT. One line, not a
     table of completed values.
   · NO DIM. It is a page. There is no overlay in this file.
   · ONE MANGO — `FormScreen`'s commit. Back is the cancel variant, Change is
     a text button.
   · Every user-facing string is a prop. No px, no hex, no `border`.

   NARROW (380px)
   One step per screen, which is what the composition already is: the rail
   folds rather than restacking (`StatusStepper` owns that), the summary and
   the arithmetic sit in the meta line directly above the buttons — the
   chapter's "the summary above the buttons" — and `Form`'s grid is one column
   below its own breakpoint. Nothing is dropped: the step count, the running
   summary, the arithmetic and both buttons are all drawn at 380.

   RENDERING CONTEXT

 *  2. hover          — the rail's completed stages, the controls'. Not here.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *  4. active/pressed — the controls' own.
 *  5. disabled       — `submitting` freezes the commit; the rail's later steps
 *                      are `later`, which is a fill and an ink, not an opacity.
 *  6. loading        — `state="loading"`: the rail stays and the body unfills,
 *                      so the reader keeps their place in the sequence.
 *  7. empty          — does not apply. A wizard with no steps is not a wizard.
 *  8. error          — `state="error"`: the body carries the failure; the rail
 *                      stays, because the steps already taken are still true.
 *  9. selected       — the current step on the rail, and the picked rows in a
 *                      selection step.
 * 10. read-only      — does not apply. This is the one screen in the batch
 *                      that holds fields.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  · 380 — one step per screen. The rail folds; the summary and the arithmetic
 *    sit immediately above the buttons; both buttons stay.
 *  · tablet / desktop — the same, with `Form`'s two-column grid available to a
 *    step that asks for it.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling.

         the rail stacked ABOVE the form and every wizard in the kit drew its
         steps on the wrong side. L-F7 / L-F17.

         The grid is the artifact's own, copied off 27.38's markup and

         Two items in an auto-fit track list collapse the empty tracks, so it
         resolves to an even split at every width — which is what the chapter
         draws, the rail column carrying the summary card beside the steps.

         It is switched on at 45rem rather than left to the grid's own wrap,
         so it changes at the SAME width `StepperHero` lies its rail down at.
         Left to itself the grid would go two-column at ~584px while the rail
