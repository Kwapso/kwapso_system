   EmptyCollectionScreen — composition 27.21.

   THE ONE SENTENCE
   "A collection nobody has added to. The rail, header, tabs and toolbar all
   stay drawn (law 4): only the rows are replaced. It is the one empty state
   allowed to carry an action, because the action is the whole point of the
   screen."

   DESIGN SOURCE — "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 27.21, verbatim:

     THE FRAME NEVER GOES AWAY
       "Rail, header, figures, tabs and toolbar stay exactly where they are —
        only the rows are replaced. A member should be able to search, switch
        tab or add a record from an empty collection without the page changing
        shape when the first record arrives."

     FIGURES READ ZERO, IN DISABLED INK
       "Zeros are shown, not hidden. A blank strip looks broken; a zero in
        disabled ink says the count is real and the collection is simply new."

     TWO ACTIONS, AND THE MANGO IS THE FIRST RECORD
       "Add the first takes the one mango — the only place a labelled create
        button is allowed, because there is no toolbar + to lean on and the
        screen exists to be filled. Import sits beside it in paper."

     IT SAYS WHERE RECORDS COME FROM
       "One sentence naming the two routes — someone adds one, or a client
        raises one. An empty state that only says 'no records' teaches nothing
        and gets screenshotted into a support thread."

     NO ILLUSTRATION, EVER
       "No empty-box drawing, no mascot, no dashed placeholder rectangle. Type
        and one button carry it, left-aligned like everything else. The brand
        does not draw pictures of absence."

     DOORS DIFFER
       "The portal's empty collection drops Import and says 'Raise your first
        request', because a client cannot add records on someone else's
        behalf. Everything else is identical."

   FOUR SCREENS, NEVER CONFLATED — 27.21 · 27.22 · 27.23 · 27.7
   The chapter's own group heading is "Three different emptinesses, three
   different answers. They must never be mistaken for one another", and 27.7
   is a fourth thing again. What separates THIS file from the other three:
     · 27.21 (here)  — nothing has been created. The frame stays, the figures
                       read ZERO, and this is THE ONE empty state that carries
                       a labelled mango create.
     · 27.22 no-results — records exist and a facet excluded them. No mango in
                       the body at all; the facets stay on screen with an ×.
     · 27.23 not-found  — one record's URL is dead. The body names the record
                       NUMBER and hands back a route.
     · 27.7 denial      — a dialog over the blurred page naming who can grant
                       access. Never a code.

   IT IS A MAIN SCREEN IN ITS EMPTY REGISTER
   `SHELL.md`: "a main screen is in the navbar; a detail screen has
   breadcrumbs." A collection is in the navbar whether or not anybody has
   added to it, so this screen is `MainScreen` with `state="empty"` — and
   27.21's own first sentence is the same law from the other side: "The frame
   never goes away … rail, header, figures, tabs and toolbar stay exactly
   where they are — only the rows are replaced."

   What the shell sweep fixed here, off `SHELL.md`'s own list of errors:

     · THE OFF-BEIGE BODY PANE. This file used to return a bare `div` holding
       `CollectionFrame`, so the page, the screen card, the rail and the body
       pane were all missing — and 27.21's sentence names the rail first.
     · THE FIGURE STRIP LIES BARE. The three zeros were in `StatGrid`'s CARDS.
       `SHELL.md`: "the figure strip on a main screen — bare on the body pane,
       NOT in cards … the one exception is the dashboard (27.11)". They are a
       `StatStrip surface="bare"` now, and the zeros are unchanged.
     · EXPORT AND THE STEPPED-DOWN CREATE ARE IN THE HEADER BAND. They were in
       `CollectionFrame`'s `actions`, which is the TOOLBAR inside the panel;
       the artifact draws both beside the heading.
     · NO FOOTER, AND IT CANNOT GROW ONE. `MainScreen` has no footer slot.

   WHY THE BODY IS STILL COMPOSED HERE AND NOT `ShapeStateBody`'s
   `ShapeStateBody` routes through `ScreenRegister`, which is CENTRED and
   draws a MARK above the title. 27.21 forbids both in the same breath —
   "left-aligned like everything else" and "no empty-box drawing" — so the
   body is composed here from `Headline`, `Text` and two `Button`s and handed
   to `MainScreen`'s `emptyBody` slot, which exists for exactly this: a shape
   that owns a screen's words handing its own register down rather than
   taking `CollectionFrame`'s default. Nothing here draws a fill or a radius.

   AND WHY THE STRIP GOES THROUGH `figureStrip` RATHER THAN `figures`
   `MainScreen` hands its `figures` DATA to `StatStrip` along with the
   screen's `state`, and a `StatStrip` in the empty state draws the register
   instead of its tiles. That is right for a collection whose numbers came out
   of a request that returned nothing, and it is exactly wrong here: 27.21
   wants the zeros DRAWN, in disabled ink, because "a blank strip looks
   broken". So the strip is passed as the node `MainScreen` keeps for a route
   that has to keep its own — and it is the route's job to keep it bare, which
   is why `surface="bare"` is written out below.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · ONE MANGO, AND IT IS "ADD THE FIRST". The header band's create steps down
     to a paper glyph on this screen so the screen never carries two, and
     `onCreate` is withheld from `MainScreen` so no second one can be drawn.
     Override 17 counts ACTIONS, not objects, and the register's create is one.
   · A ZERO IS DRAWN, IN DISABLED INK. `Badge count={0}` renders NOTHING by
     kit law, so the tab counts and the figure values are passed as nodes in
     `--ink-disabled` rather than as counts. That is the artifact's sentence,
     not a workaround.
   · EVERY STRING IS A PROP with a default (PATTERN §7).
   · NO CSS `border`, no px, no literal colour, no gradient, no illustration.
   · Focus is one global rule. Dark is a token flip.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. The toolbar, the tabs and the two actions all carry
   handlers built during this module's own render.

 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *  4. active/pressed — owned by `Button`.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. Nothing on an empty collection is
 *                      switched off; the zeros are DISABLED INK, which is a
 *                      colour for a real count, not a disabled control.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply here. A collection whose rows have not
 *                      arrived is 27.6, a different composition: it keeps the
 *                      row geometry rather than saying "nothing yet".
 *  7. empty          — see 1.
 *  8. error          — does not apply. A collection that FAILED is ruling
 *                      06's block failure, not an empty one.
 *  9. selected       — the open tab, owned by `CollectionFrame`.
 * 10. read-only      — a reader with no create right is passed no `onCreate`;
 *                      the control is then absent, never dimmed (ch24.6).
 *
 * NARROW (380px), STATED
 *  · The frame does NOT change: header, figures, tabs and toolbar all stay
 *    drawn. 27.21's narrow render is the same screen, not a reduction.
 *  · THE RAIL AND THE HEADER CONTROLS ARE THE TWO EXCEPTIONS, and they are
 *    `SHELL.md`'s, not this screen's: "drops the rail entirely — no hamburger
 *    is drawn anywhere in the kit. Drops controls, never counts." Export and
 *    the stepped-down create go with it; every zero stays, which is the one
 *    thing 27.21's own narrow caption asks for ("zeros stay"). The register's
 *    "Add the first" is in the BODY, not the header band, so it survives —
 *    which is the whole point of the screen.
 *  · The figure strip rewraps to one column on its own `auto-fit` grid; the
 *    zeros stay ("zeros stay" is the narrow render's own caption).
 *  · Tabs marked `narrow: false` are hidden below `sm` — the artifact's narrow
 *    render carries All / Mine and drops Archived.
 *  · The toolbar condenses rather than being dropped (27.1): the search field
 *    takes its own full-width line and the facet, export and create sit under
 *    it.
 *  · The two actions STACK, mango first, and the body's tail sentence is
 *    dropped — both are the artifact's own narrow drawing.

     nothing by kit law, so the zero is a node in the disabled ink token.

     CORRECTLY DIVERGENT — do not "fix" either of these to tertiary.
     GAPS-CONTRAST §2 rows 6 and 10 measure both at 2.433:1 light / 3.321:1
     dark. The register figure below is the one that matters: at 41.25px it
     is LARGE TEXT, so its threshold is 3.0 rather than 4.5 — and it misses
     even that, in light, by 0.567. It stays, because the artifact asks for
     this tier by name and gives its reason: 27.21's heading is "Figures read
     zero, in disabled ink" and its body is "A blank strip looks broken; a
     zero in disabled ink says the count is real and the collection is simply
     new."

     Worth saying out loud, since the artifact chose an exempt tier for the
     largest number on the screen: a zero here is not a disabled control. It
     is the answer to "how many are there", drawn at 41px precisely so it
     carries — and then painted in the one ink that is excused from being
     legible. Recorded in GAPS-CONTRAST "Resolved" as a ruled divergence with
