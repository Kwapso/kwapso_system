/* ============================================================================
   Shape states — the loading, empty and error version of every shape in this
   folder (imported by all eleven of them; shape 12 of 12).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 27, four compositions and one law:

     ch27 · Law 4 · A state is a body swap, verbatim:
       "Loading, empty and archived are the same composition with the body
        replaced; adding, editing and denial are the same composition with a
        layer over it. Either way the rail, header and tabs stay drawn and
        stay put. Only a whole-page failure is allowed to replace the frame."

     ch27.6 loading, verbatim: "A loading screen in kwapso is the destination
       screen with its body unfilled. Rail, header, title and tabs render
       immediately from what the app already knows, so the page never appears
       to be built twice." And what it forbids: "A centred spinner on an empty
       page, a percentage that isn't real, a 'please wait' sentence."

     ch27.21 empty and ch27.22 no-results are DIFFERENT SCREENS and the kit
       says so: "It is a different screen from 27.21 and must never be
       mistaken for it: nothing here is missing, something here is switched
       on." Empty carries the one mango create; no-results carries no mango
       at all, "because clearing filters is a retreat".

     ch27.23 not found: the frame stays. "Only a whole-page failure or a dead
       session (27.19) may replace the frame."

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · IT NEVER DRAWS A REGISTER OF ITS OWN. `ScreenRegister` (tier 2) already
     draws all four tones with the marks ruled in GAPS-COL3 SCR-4. This file
     chooses the tone and supplies the words; it writes no layout, no ink and
     no mark.
   · EMPTY AND NO-RESULTS ARE NEVER THE SAME REGISTER. `filtered` picks the
     tone, and the two carry different copy and different actions, because
     ch27.22 says offering "Add a record" to somebody whose filter is too
     narrow makes them create a duplicate.
   · A STATE IS THE BODY, NEVER THE FRAME. `ShapeStateBody` returns the body
     only. Every shape here keeps its heading, tabs and toolbar drawn while
     it is in one of these states — that is law 4, and each shape enforces it
     by passing `state` down to the collection that owns its body rather than
     replacing itself.
   · ONE COPY OBJECT PER SHAPE, NOT THIRTY PROPS. PATTERN §7 requires every
     user-facing string to be a prop with a default. Eleven shapes × eight
     strings is eighty-eight props, so each shape takes one `copy` prop of
     `Partial<ShapeStateCopy>` merged over its default. Every string is still
     overridable per locale, which is the rule's actual purpose.
   · Focus is one global rule. No radius, no colour and no size is decided
     here — this file is words and routing.

   WHY THE SHELL MEASURE LIVES HERE
   `SHAPE_SHELL` is the two-door measure from commission §9, copied from
   `ScreenRenderer`'s own map so the two can never drift. It sits in this file
   because this is the module every other shape already imports; a thirteenth
   file for one record of two strings would be worse. Logged as SHP-1 in
   GAPS-SHAPES.md.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   No `"use client"`. This module holds no state, calls no hook and creates no
   handler during its own render.

 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply, same reason as hover.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. There is nothing here to switch off.
 *  6. loading        — `tone="loading"`: skeleton lines, never a spinner.
 *  7. empty          — `tone="empty"`, or `noResults` when `filtered`.
 *  8. error          — `tone="error"`: CH21's poppy-dot eyebrow
 *                      (`words.errorEyebrow`, "Load failed" by default),
 *                      ruling 06's sentence, and whatever `action` the call
 *                      site passes — `ScreenRegister`'s own action row is a
 *                      `flex flex-wrap` slot, so a Retry AND a secondary
 *                      Copy/text action both fit one `action` node (a
 *                      fragment of two `Button`s), the same shape as a
 *                      single retry. 2026-09-02: closed against a client
 *                      reference card that showed both the dot and a two-
 *                      button row; see `ScreenRegister`'s own header.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply.
 * 10. read-only      — does not apply.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED. `ScreenRegister` is a single column
 *  at every width and the kit draws it the same in both renders; a register
 *  that restacked would jump when data arrived, which ch27.6 forbids.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling. Nothing here is directional.
