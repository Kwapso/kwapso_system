   NewEmptyRecordScreen — CH27.39, "A record with nothing in it yet · Just
   created — and every panel says what it is waiting for".

   COMPOSED, NOT DRAWN
     · DetailScreen     — shape 0b: `ScreenShell`'s four levels with the three
                          things a record puts in them, and `RecordChrome` —
                          which IS 27.8 — inside them. The band, the identity
                          row, the line tabs, the one opaque panel and the
                          footer are all its. 27.39's own last rule is "It is
                          27.8, not a special screen", so this file adds no
                          region — and the shell it now stands on is the one
                          BOTH screens share, not a region of this screen's.
     · DescriptionList  — the facts row. Unset facts are its `emptyValueLabel`.
     · CollectionFrame  — one per empty panel, `tone="bare"`, in its own
                          `empty` state, carrying that panel's own sentence
                          and that panel's own paper action.
     · the ink footer   — `RecordChrome`'s, which is `RecordDetail`'s. The log
                          and 27.8's add-a-note field are its LEFT column and
                          the key/value pairs its right; this file supplies the
                          content and composes no feed and no field of its own.
   Not one fill, radius, type step or ring is written in this file. The one
   exception is stated and justified below: `text-ink-disabled` on "Not set".

   DESIGN SOURCE — KWAPSO-SPEC.md CH27, composition 27.39.

     The strapline, verbatim:
       "The first minute of a record's life. It is 27.8 with empty panels, and
        each one names what will fill it and who fills it. This is the screen
        that decides whether a new record feels started or abandoned."

     "Empty panels stay, and explain themselves", verbatim:
       "Every panel a full record would have is drawn, each with one sentence
        naming what fills it and when. A record that hides its empty sections
        teaches nobody what happens next."

     "Unset facts read 'Not set' in disabled ink", verbatim:
       "Not blank, not a dash, not hidden. Disabled ink is exactly the right
        weight for a value that is legitimately absent, and it keeps the facts
        row the same shape as a filled record's."

     "One action per empty panel, in paper", verbatim:
       "Link a ticket, Write to the client. Each is the paper secondary — the
        page already has its mango on Edit, and an empty record should not
        shout three primaries at a reader."

     "The log is never empty", verbatim:
       "It always holds the creation line with the actor and the time, so the
        footer is a real panel from the first second. A record with an empty
        history looks broken and unowned."

     "It is 27.8, not a special screen", verbatim:
       "Same identity row, same facts row, same charcoal footer, same tabs.
        Nothing about being new changes the composition — only what the panels
        say."

     "Doors differ", verbatim:
       "A request raised in the portal lands here with the client's words
        already in 'What was asked' and Owner unset — which is why Owner is
        the first thing the system asks a member to fill."

     Narrow, verbatim: "Narrow · the same sentences, one panel per screen
       width".

   IT IS A DETAIL SCREEN, AND THERE IS NO BREADCRUMB ON ONE — OVERRIDE 73
   (2026-08-26). The client: "detail pages do not need this bar that you
   have on top where we have Padelbase and the number." So it is
   `DetailScreen` with the band empty, and the four levels arrive with the
   shape rather than being missing: off-beige page, soft-paper screen card,
   the rail, and THE OFF-BEIGE BODY PANE the panels stand on. The title
   leads the body pane and the identity chips — the black ID chip first —
   sit directly under it, and 27.39's "same identity row … same charcoal
   footer, same tabs" is otherwise untouched: every one of them is still
   drawn by the same `RecordChrome` one level down.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · IT IS 27.8. `RecordChrome` is the whole composition. This file supplies
     facts, prose, empty panels and a log; it invents no region and moves
     none.
   · "NOT SET" IS DISABLED INK, AND IT IS A REAL VALUE. `DescriptionList`'s
     `emptyValueLabel` renders wherever a fact's value is `undefined`, so the
     facts row keeps a filled record's shape. `text-ink-disabled` is a TOKEN
     utility, not a literal, and the precedent is `empty-collection.tsx`,
     which draws its zeros the same way for the same reason.
   · EVERY EMPTY PANEL IS DRAWN AND EXPLAINS ITSELF, LEFT-ALIGNED. `body` is
     REQUIRED on an empty panel: a panel that cannot say what fills it is
     exactly the panel the chapter forbids, and in development an omission
     warns. The sentence is composed rather than routed through
     `CollectionFrame`'s empty register, because that register is CENTRED —
     the same reason `empty-collection.tsx` composes its own body for 27.21's
     "left-aligned like everything else".
   · ONE PAPER ACTION PER EMPTY PANEL. `action` renders `variant="secondary"`
     and nothing else — this file offers no way to make a panel action mango.
   · ONE MANGO, AND IT IS EDIT. There are no stages on a record this new, so
     chapter 23's "Edit drops to the paper secondary" does not fire here and
     Edit keeps the page's single mango.
   · THE LOG IS NEVER EMPTY. `log` defaults to the creation line and an empty
     array warns in development. There is no state of this screen in which
     the log renders a register.
   · NOTHING IS CENTRED. 27.37 is the only centred composition in the kit.
   · Every user-facing string is a prop. No px, no hex, no `border`, no
     gradient, no exclamation mark.

   THE DIVERGENCE THAT WAS LOGGED HERE IS CLOSED (DEF-1, 2026-08-23)
   This header used to record that `RecordDetail`'s region 4 drew a wrapping
   line of tertiary sentences instead of CH27.8's charcoal card, and that the
   log therefore rode in the panel as its last section. Region 4 IS the card
   now. The log and its note field moved out of the panel and into the
   footer's left column, the key/value pairs are the right column, and this
   screen draws what the chapter draws. NEW-1 closes with it.

   NARROW (380px)
   "The same sentences, one panel per screen width." The panel is already one
   column at every width — 27.8: "No side rail of metadata … the reading
   column stays single" — so nothing restacks and nothing is dropped. What
   changes at 380 is `DescriptionList`'s pair layout, which puts each label
   above its value below 48rem, and `ActivityFeed`'s time column, which drops
   to `auto` so a history line keeps its measure. Every empty panel, every
   sentence, every paper action and the whole log are drawn at 380: the
   chapter's rule is that they stay, so they stay.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. Tab, action and note handlers are built during this render.

 *  2. hover          — the buttons' and the tabs'. Never this file's.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *  4. active/pressed — the controls' own.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply as a control state. "Not set" is
 *                      DISABLED INK on a value that is legitimately absent,
 *                      which is a meaning and not a state; a reader who may
 *                      not act is passed `actionsVisible={false}` and sees no
 *                      action rather than a grey one (CH24.6).
 *  6. loading        — `state="loading"`: the panel unfills, the band stays.
 *  7. empty          — IS THE SCREEN. Every panel is drawn in its own empty
 *                      state with its own sentence; `state="empty"` on the
 *                      shape is a different thing (a record whose sections do
 *                      not exist) and is left available rather than used.
 *  8. error          — `state="error"`: ruling 06's block failure in the panel.
 *  9. selected       — the active tab, owned by the shape.
 * 10. read-only      — the normal case. Nothing here is a field except the
 *                      add-a-note composer, which CH27.8 puts in the log.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  · 380 — one panel per screen width, which is what the composition already
 *    is. The facts row puts each label above its value, the log's time column
 *    goes `auto`, and nothing is hidden: every empty panel keeps its sentence
 *    and its paper action.
 *  · tablet / desktop — the facts row pairs label and value on one line and
 *    the log's times align at the drawn 74.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling. Nothing here names a side.
