   AccessDeniedScreen — composition 27.7.

   THE ONE SENTENCE
   "Someone pasted a link to a screen their role does not include. The screen
   they asked for still renders behind, blurred and scrimmed like any other
   layer, and the denial sits over it saying plainly what is out of reach and
   who can grant it."

   DESIGN SOURCE — "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 27.7, verbatim:

     DENIAL IS A DIALOG OVER THE PAGE
       "The screen they asked for still renders behind — blurred, desaturated,
        scrimmed, exactly as under a form panel or a delete dialog — and the
        denial sits over it. A signed-in person who mistyped a URL is never
        shown a bare page that implies they're logged out, and the
        surroundings prove they are still where they thought they were."

     SAY WHAT, NOT WHO ELSE
       "'Your role doesn't include this collection' — business language, and
        nothing more. The screen never names which roles do have access, never
        lists what the user is missing, and never shows a code, a '403' or
        'insufficient privileges'. Who can grant it is a person to ask, not a
        permission map."

     ONE WAY OUT: BACK, IN PAPER
       "The only button is Back, because the user chose where they were going
        and we don't reroute them somewhere else. Back, Cancel and Discard are
        never mango — retreating is not the primary action, even when it is
        the only one on screen. Beside it, a named person to ask; Request
        sends the ask with the reference, it does not open a mail client."

     THE RAIL SHOWS THE DOOR IT WON'T OPEN
       "Blocked items stay visible in disabled ink rather than disappearing,
        so the workspace doesn't look different to different people."

     DOORS DIFFER
       "In the portal a denial almost always means the record belongs to
        another client, so the copy says 'this isn't in your workspace' and
        points at their own overview. It never names another client."

   HOW THIS IS KEPT DISTINCT FROM 27.21, 27.22 AND 27.23
     · It is the only one of the four that is a LAYER. The other three are
       body swaps inside a frame that stays; this one leaves the requested
       screen drawn underneath and puts a dialog over it.
     · It is the only one that names a PERSON who can grant it, and the only
       one with a Request control and a reference.
     · It carries NO mango at all — not even the moved case 27.23 allows.
     · It never states a record number as its subject and never says what
       happened to anything. 27.23 says what happened; this says who to ask.

   THE ONE AUTHORISED BLUR — AND THE FIGURES ARE THE ARTIFACT'S OWN.
   Nothing else in the kit blurs. The `behind` node is blurred, desaturated
   and made inert (`aria-hidden`, `pointer-events-none`); the scrim is
   `Dialog`'s own, so it is "exactly as under a form panel or a delete
   dialog". T3B-1 logged the radius and the saturation as unstated and this
   file derived both; the 2026-08-22 extract STATES them — 27.7 and 27.2 draw
   the page behind with `filter: blur(2.5px) saturate(.82); opacity: .5`, and
   27.2's prose spells it out: "blurred 2.5px, desaturated and dropped to
   half opacity". The derivations (`--space-1`, `saturate-50`, full opacity)
   are gone; the drawn values ship. T3B-1 is closed by the artifact itself.

   WHAT THE ARTIFACT ACTUALLY DRAWS, TRANSCRIBED OFF p22
   The card opens on a **poppy-dot chip reading `No access`** in the quiet
   fill — not an uppercase eyebrow, and the words "No access" are not the
   headline. Under it the headline IS the sentence, "This collection isn't
   part of your role.", at the modal's title step. Then the paragraph, with
   the member's name in medium. Then a **nested soft-paper well** holding the
   label "Who can grant it" in sentence case over an avatar row — `AC`,
   "Member name · workspace owner", and `Request` as bare bold type at the
   trailing end, no pill. Then the card's own footer line: `Reference 4182-AC`
   at the reading start, a paper `Back` pill at the end, facing each other.
   The narrow render drops the well's label and the reference and takes Back
   to the full measure; everything else is the desktop card, shorter.

   Five of those were wrong until 2026-08-24 and are recorded in
   GAPS-KIT-F.md as AD-1 … AD-5.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · NO CODE, EVER. There is no "403" in this file and no prop that can carry
     a status. `reference` is a support reference the artifact draws, not an
     error code.
   · NO MANGO. Back is `secondary`, Request is `secondary`. The chapter says
     retreating is never the primary action even when it is the only one.
   · THE PAGE BEHIND IS REAL. `behind` takes the actual screen. Passing
     nothing draws nothing behind, which is honest — never a fake page.
   · EVERY STRING IS A PROP with a default.
   · No CSS `border`, no px, no literal colour, no illustration.
   · Focus is one global rule. Dark is a token flip.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. Radix `Dialog`, and both controls carry handlers.

 *                      Radix moves focus into the dialog and traps it.
 *  4. active/pressed — owned by `Button`.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. Neither control is ever switched off:
 *                      Back is the way out and Request is the ask.
 *  6. loading        — the Request in flight is `Button loading`, which keeps
 *                      its own fill. Nothing else here waits.
 *  7. empty          — `grantor={null}` renders no grantor block. A denial with
 *                      nobody to ask still says what is out of reach, which
 *                      is the honest picture; an invented name would be
 *                      worse than none.
 *  8. error          — DOES NOT APPLY, and this is the whole point of the
 *                      composition. A denial is not an error and never shows
 *                      a code (27.7). A request that FAILED to send is the
 *                      Button's own business.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply.
 * 10. read-only      — always. Nothing here is editable.
 *
 * NARROW (380px), STATED
 *  · The page behind stays blurred and scrimmed at every width — the point is
 *    that the reader can see they are still where they thought they were, and
 *    that is as true on a phone.
 *  · `DialogContent` is `max-w-full` inside a 24 gutter, so the 460 surface
 *    becomes the width of the phone minus its gutter. Its 32 inset does not
 *    shrink.
 *  · The paragraph swaps to the artifact's shorter narrow wording, and the
 *    grantor's role shortens with it ("owner", not "workspace owner").
 *  · The grantor row and the two controls stack; `ActionRow align="end"`
 *    reverses below `sm` so Back is on top while staying last in the DOM.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling.
