   BulkEditScreen — composition 27.32.

   THE ONE SENTENCE
   "Changing several records at once. The bulk bar replaces the toolbar in
   place (27.1) and the panel that opens is the edit panel from 27.3 with one
   difference: every field says what it will do to how many records."

   DESIGN SOURCE — "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 27.32, verbatim:

     THE COUNT IS IN EVERY SENTENCE
       "Title, helper line, each field's note and the commit button all carry
        the number. 'Edit' with no count is how somebody changes 240 records
        meaning to change four."

     UNTOUCHED FIELDS STAY UNTOUCHED
       "A bulk panel opens with nothing filled. Only fields the reader
        actually sets are written; the rest are left exactly as they are per
        record, and the panel says so in prose above the fields."

     MIXED VALUES ARE NAMED, NOT BLANKED
       "A field whose records disagree reads 'Mixed — leave as they are' in
        tertiary ink rather than showing empty. Blank would imply the change
        is to clear it."

     IT SAYS HOW MANY WILL ACTUALLY CHANGE
       "Under a set field: changes 6 records, 4 are already In review. The
        difference between selected and affected is exactly what a reader
        wants to know before pressing."

     THE SELECTION STAYS VISIBLE
       "The list keeps its ticks and its selected fills beside the panel, so
        the subject of the edit is never off-screen. Nothing collapses to '6
        items'."

     ONE LOG LINE PER RECORD
       "A bulk change writes an ordinary activity line on each record, not one
        'bulk operation' entry. A record's own history must be complete
        without knowing about the batch."

     DOORS DIFFER
       "The portal has no bulk edit and no row checkboxes at all: a client
        acts on one request at a time, which is also why its rows carry no
        selection column."

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · THE BAR REPLACES THE TOOLBAR IN PLACE. It goes into `CollectionFrame`'s
     own toolbar slot and the search, the facets and the page actions are not
     passed while a selection is live. The frame does not move, nothing is
     stacked above it, and no second row appears — "in place" is the whole
     instruction.
   · EVERY FIELD NAMES ITS OWN BLAST RADIUS, AND IT IS COMPUTED, NOT TYPED.
     `formatChanges` is given the selected count and the already-at-this-value
     count; a field that is SET draws the note and a field that is untouched
     draws nothing, because there is nothing yet to describe.
   · MIXED IS WORDS IN TERTIARY INK, NEVER A BLANK CONTROL. It rides the
     `Select`'s placeholder, which ruling 25/27 already puts in tertiary — so
     the ink is the kit's, not a colour chosen here.
   · ONE LOG LINE PER RECORD IS SAID ON THE SCREEN. It is the save bar's meta
     line, beside the commit, because the promise is about what the press
     does.
   · ONE MANGO, AND IT IS "Change 6". Every control in the bulk bar is paper
     EXCEPT Delete, which p36 draws as the poppy fill at both widths
     (`background: var(--poppy)`, charcoal label) — the one filled red pill
     the compositions draw outside 27.4's confirmation. 27.20's "never a
     filled red button in a list" governs LISTS; the bulk bar is a toolbar
     replacement acting on a counted selection, and the artifact's own
     drawing separates the two. The code follows the drawing.
   · THERE IS NO `door` PROP. The portal has no bulk edit and no row
     checkboxes; a prop offering a portal variant would imply one exists.
   · EVERY STRING IS A PROP with a default (PATTERN §7).
   · No CSS `border`, no px, no literal colour, no gradient, no illustration.
   · Focus is one global rule. Dark is a token flip.

   THE COLLECTION BEHIND THE PANEL IS A MAIN SCREEN, AND IT IS DRAWN AS ONE
   THIS COMPOSITION AS A WHOLE IS NEITHER OF THE TWO SCREENS — it is a
   selection STATE plus an overlay, and `SHELL.md` gives selection its own
   treatment rather than a screen of its own. But the collection UNDER the
   overlay is an ordinary main screen: it is in the navbar, it has an eyebrow
   with a count, tabs and a toolbar. So it is drawn by `MainScreen`
   rather than assembled here.

   It used to hand `eyebrow` and `heading` straight to a bare
   `CollectionFrame`. That is 26.03's anatomy diagram, not a screen: it draws
   level 4 (the panel) and the off-beige ground under it, and simply omits
   level 1 (the page), level 2 (the soft-paper SCREEN CARD) and the header
   band that lies on it. `SHELL.md` is the law being followed — "the eyebrow
   and the title are in the HEADER BAND, on the screen card's soft paper" —
   and `MainScreen`'s own header says why a route may not shortcut it: "this
   file does not simply hand `CollectionFrame` a heading."

   DO NOT PUT IT BACK. No route paints its own idea of the page; the four
   levels are written down in exactly one place, `screen-shell.tsx`, and
   reaching past `MainScreen` to `CollectionFrame` is how they went missing
   the first time. The OVERLAY is untouched by this and stays what it is.

   Two of `MainScreen`'s slots are deliberately NOT used here. `meta` is a
   description line under the heading and 27.32 draws none. `panel={false}`
   would remove the soft-paper panel and with it the toolbar and the folder
   tabs — which is the opposite of what this screen needs, since the toolbar's
   slot is the whole subject of the bulk bar below.

   WHY THE PANEL IS A `Sheet` HERE AND NOT `FormScreen`
   `FormScreen surface="panel"` is 27.3's edit panel and would be the obvious
   reach, but it pins `side="right"` — and 27.32's narrow render is explicit:
   "the panel is a bottom sheet". So the panel is assembled from the same
   parts `FormScreen` uses — `Sheet`, `Form`, `Field`, `FormActions` — with
   the side chosen by width. Nothing is redrawn; one prop is chosen that the
   shape does not expose. Logged as T3B-9 in GAPS-TRACK3B.md, because the
   shape should probably grow the prop rather than every caller repeating
   this.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. A media subscription, Radix `Sheet`, and the selection and
   field handlers built during this module's own render.

 * A collection with a live selection, and the panel that edits it.

 *  1. default        — the frame, the bulk bar in the toolbar's place, the
 *                      ticked rows, and the panel beside them.
 *  2. hover          — the row wash is `DataTable`'s; the controls' is
 *                      `Button`'s. Nothing here draws one.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *  4. active/pressed — the controls' own.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. A record the reader may not change is
 *                      not selectable in the first place
 *                      (`DataTable isRowSelectable`), which is ch24.6's hide
 *                      rather than dim, one level down.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply. The rows are already on screen; that
 *                      is how they got ticked. A change IN FLIGHT is the
 *                      commit control's own spinner, which `Button` draws.
 *  7. empty          — NOT A STATE OF THIS SCREEN. With nothing ticked there
 *                      is no bulk bar and no panel: the collection is 27.1
 *                      again, which is what `selectedIds` being empty draws.
 *  8. error          — does not apply here. A change that failed is reported
 *                      per record, because the promise this screen makes is
 *                      one log line per record.
 *  9. selected       — THE SUBJECT OF THE WHOLE SCREEN. `DataTable` draws the
 *                      ticks and the selected fills, and they stay drawn
 *                      beside the panel: "nothing collapses to '6 items'".
 * 10. read-only      — a reader with no bulk right is passed no handlers, so
 *                      the bar's controls are absent rather than dimmed.
 *
 * NARROW (380px), STATED — the artifact's own second render
 *  · THE BULK BAR WRAPS. It stays in the toolbar's place and does not become
 *    a second row or a floating bar; it is a wrapping flex row, so the count
 *    and Clear take the first line and the actions fall to the next.
 *  · EXPORT LEAVES THE BAR. The artifact's narrow bar carries Edit, Assign
 *    and Delete. Export of a selection is available from the page's own
 *    export (27.31), so nothing is lost.
 *  · THE EYEBROW SAYS THE SELECTION. "Group · 6 selected" replaces "Group ·
 *    24 open" while something is ticked, because at this width the bar's own
 *    count can be below the fold.
 *  · THE PANEL IS A BOTTOM SHEET, not the right-hand drawer. The list stays
 *    above it, still ticked.
 *  · THE PROSE SHORTENS. "Only the fields you touch are changed." — the
 *    artifact's own narrow wording.
 *  · EVERY COUNT STAYS. Title, each set field's note and the commit control
 *    all keep their number at 380 exactly as at 1440. That is the rule this
 *    composition exists for.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling.
