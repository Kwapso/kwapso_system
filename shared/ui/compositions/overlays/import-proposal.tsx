   ImportProposalScreen — composition 27.44, and ruling 33.

   THE ONE SENTENCE
   "The import that maps itself. The system reads the file, proposes a field
   for every column with a confidence, and asks a person to approve it. This
   is the one overlay in the kit that owns the window — a half-finished import
   must not be abandoned by a stray click behind it."

   DESIGN SOURCE — "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 27.44, verbatim:

     A PROPOSAL IS NEVER APPLIED BY ARRIVING
       "Nothing is written until Approve is pressed, and the screen says so
        beside the button. Confidence is shown per field so the person
        approving knows which line they are actually vouching for."

     LOW CONFIDENCE IS A DOT AND A SENTENCE
       "A field the system is unsure about takes a poppy dot, a plain count in
        the header — '1 needs you' — and the real values from the file so the
        guess can be judged. Never a percentage alone."

     STEPS STAY VISIBLE AND REVISITABLE
       "The four steps sit down the left, current in mango, done in paper,
        later in disabled ink. Going back a step keeps the proposal — a person
        checking their work should not have to re-upload."

     IT IS THE ONLY OVERLAY THAT OWNS THE WINDOW
       "The floating layer never dims the page; this does, because an
        abandoned half-mapped import is worse than an interruption. Escape
        asks before it discards (ruling 11)."

     DOORS DIFFER
       "Clients never import. A file a client sends arrives as an attachment
        on a request, and a member runs this composition against it — so the
        confidence and the approval always belong to someone at kwapso."

   AND RULING 33, verbatim — the ruling that names this screen:
     "Where the system guesses — the import mapping today, anything else
      later — the guess is shown with a confidence per field, the unsure ones
      are surfaced first, and nothing is written until a person presses
      Approve."

   THIS IS NOT 27.30. SEE THE SAME NOTE IN `import.tsx`.
   The two are separate compositions in separate groups and the chapter draws
   them separately. In one line each: 27.30 is a full-width PAGE where a
   PERSON maps six columns by hand across a rail of four ticked steps, and
   commits with the row count on the button. 27.44 is an OVERLAY THAT OWNS THE
   WINDOW where the SYSTEM has already proposed every mapping with a
   percentage, the unsure ones are surfaced with a poppy dot and a count, and
   the commit is the single word Approve. Nothing in this file counts rows on
   its commit control and nothing in `import.tsx` states a confidence.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · CONFIDENCE PER FIELD, ON EVERY FIELD. `confidence` is required on a
     `ProposedMapping`, not optional. Ruling 33 says "a confidence per field",
     and an optional confidence is a confidence that gets dropped.
   · THE UNSURE ONES ARE SURFACED FIRST. This file sorts them to the top
     itself rather than asking the call site to — the same thing
     `ImportWizard` does with its own `unsure` flag, for the same reason.
   · NEVER A PERCENTAGE ALONE. A field under `needsYouBelow` draws three
     things together: the poppy dot, the words "Needs you", and the REAL
     VALUES out of the file. The percentage rides beside them; it is never
     the only signal, and the dot is never the only signal either (ruling 26).
   · THE COUNT IS PLAIN WORDS IN THE HEADER. "1 needs you" — a count and a
     sentence, not a badge with a number in it.
   · NOTHING IS WRITTEN UNTIL APPROVE, AND IT IS SAID BESIDE THE BUTTON. The
     sentence sits in the footer's meta slot, on the same row as Approve.
   · ESCAPE ASKS BEFORE IT DISCARDS. This overlay does NOT close itself.
     Escape, the scrim and the close chip all call `onRequestClose`; ruling
     11's confirmation is the application's to draw, and this screen refuses
     to guess that a stray keypress meant "throw the mapping away".
   · ONE MANGO, AND IT IS APPROVE. Cancel is paper — retreating is never the
     primary action.
   · THERE IS NO `door` PROP. Clients never import; a prop offering a portal
     variant would imply one exists.
   · EVERY STRING IS A PROP with a default (PATTERN §7).
   · No CSS `border`, no px, no literal colour, no gradient, no illustration.
     The dim is `Dialog`'s own scrim — a `color-mix` fill, not an opacity and
     not a blur.
   · Focus is one global rule. Dark is a token flip.

   WHAT THE ARTIFACT DRAWS TWICE, DIFFERENTLY
   In the desktop render the unsure row's field cell holds the PROBLEM —
   `Needs you — "14.08.26", "ASAP", "—"` — and no proposed field. In the
   narrow render the same column carries a proposed field ("Due date") AND the
   values. The proposal plainly exists at both widths, so this file draws the
   union: the control with the proposal in it, and the dot, the words and the
   real values under it. Logged as T3B-4 in GAPS-TRACK3B.md.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. Radix `Dialog`, one piece of disclosure state for the
   narrow summary, and select handlers built during this module's own render.

/**
 * The overlay that proposes a mapping and asks to be approved.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — the rail, the proposal, the sentence, the two buttons.
 *  2. hover          — the controls'. Nothing in this file draws a wash.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      and Radix traps focus inside the overlay while it is
 *                      open — which is the point of an overlay that owns the
 *                      window.
 *  4. active/pressed — `Button`'s, `Select`'s and `StatusStepper`'s.
 *  5. disabled       — a LATER step, drawn by `StatusStepper` as the quiet
 *                      fill with disabled ink, which is the artifact's own
 *                      words for it. Nothing else here is switched off:
 *                      Approve stays live with an unsure field on screen,
 *                      because ruling 33 asks a person to vouch, not the
 *                      model to be certain.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply. A file still being read is step 01; a
 *                      proposal still being computed has not opened this
 *                      screen yet.
 *  7. empty          — does not apply. A file with no columns produces no
 *                      proposal and this overlay is not raised.
 *  8. error          — does not apply to the overlay. A file that could not
 *                      be read fails at step 01 with the file named; a low
 *                      confidence is NOT an error and must never be drawn as
 *                      one — it is a question, and the answer is a person.
 *  9. selected       — the current step, `StatusStepper`'s mango pill with
 *                      `aria-current="step"`. Colour never alone.
 * 10. read-only      — does not apply. There is exactly one reader of this
 *                      screen and they are the approver.
 *
 * NARROW (380px), STATED — the artifact's own second render
 *  · THE STEPS BECOME A BAR. The four pills down the left do not survive 380,
 *    so the rail is replaced by the step's name and "02 of 04" on one line —
 *    the artifact's own words.
 *  · ONE FIELD AT A TIME. Each unsure column becomes a card carrying its own
 *    heading, its real values, its proposed field and two paper controls,
 *    Note and Skip. The confident columns collapse behind one line — "13
 *    columns mapped" with a Show — so the screen opens on the work rather
 *    than on the thirteen rows nobody needs to read. Note and Skip are drawn
 *    at this width only, because it is the only width where the row is a card
 *    with room for them; on desktop, skipping a column is the field control's
 *    own job. Logged as T3B-4.
 *  · THE HEADER COUNT STAYS. "1 needs you" is the first thing on the panel at
 *    both widths — it is the reason the screen is open.
 *  · THE SENTENCE STAYS BESIDE THE BUTTON. `DialogFooter` reverses to a
 *    column below 40rem, so Approve spans the row with Cancel under it and
 *    "Nothing is written until you press Approve" above both.
 *  · THE OVERLAY STILL OWNS THE WINDOW, and at 380 that is the whole screen
 *    inside the scrim's own inset.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling.
