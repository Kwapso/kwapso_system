/* ============================================================================
   DeleteConfirmationDialog + ArchiveConfirmationDialog — compositions 27.4
   and the second half of 27.5. The one composition that is a modal, and the
   softer dialog that points away from it.

   MISSING UNTIL 2026-08-26. The client's fidelity re-audit against the
   original artifact found that neither dialog was built anywhere: 27.4 is a
   headline specimen ("Deletion is the only irreversible action in either
   door, so it is the only one that stops the page") and archive.tsx's own
   header logged its dialog as ARCH-2, "raised from the row menu of every
   collection rather than from here" — and no file ever raised it. Both are
   drawn here from the artifact's own markup, figure for figure.

   DESIGN SOURCE — "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html", 27.4 and 27.5.

     27.4's own opening, verbatim:
       "Deletion is the only irreversible action in either door, so it is the
        only one that stops the page. Type delete in the field below to see
        the confirm arm."

     27.4 "The title is the sentence", verbatim:
       "Number, em-separator, record title, question mark. The body then lists
        exactly what goes and what stays, in counts — '14 comments, 3
        attachments', not 'all related data'."

     27.4 "Type-to-confirm above ten", verbatim:
       "A single record deletes on one press. Ten or more, or anything a
        client can see, requires typing the word. The button stays poppy
        throughout — a destructive action is never disguised as a quiet one;
        only the press is gated."

     27.4 "Poppy fill, charcoal label", verbatim:
       "Solid #E94A32 with charcoal type in light, lifted #F2634B in dark.
        Never red text, never a red outline. Keep is the #E2DDD4 quiet fill,
        and the pair follows the one button order the kit uses everywhere:
        context left, Keep then Delete against the right edge, the deciding
        button furthest right."

     27.4 "It offers the softer route", verbatim:
       "Every delete dialog names archive as the alternative, in prose. That
        is why 27.5 exists and why archive is never buried in a menu."

     27.4 narrow, verbatim:
       "Below 720px the dialog becomes a bottom sheet with 24px corners. The
        two buttons share one row, each taking half the width — Keep on the
        left, Delete on the right — exactly as Discard and Save do on a form."

     27.5's archive action, its own caption:
       "The archive action · same dialog contract as delete, softer words."
       And the prose: "Same dialog, same geometry, same button order — the
       words and the fill are what differ. … the confirm is mango rather than
       poppy because the action is reversible. Archiving always records why:
       the reason field is required, the confirm stays in the quiet fill until
       it holds something, and the reason is written into the log and shown on
       the Archived tab."

   ONE CONTRADICTION IN THE ARTIFACT, RESOLVED TOWARD ITS OWN PROSE
   The artifact's interactive script draws the DELETE button in the quiet
   fill until the word is typed (`cpDelBg = cpDelArmed ? 'var(--poppy)' :
   '#E2DDD4'`). Its prose card rules the opposite: "The button stays poppy
   throughout — a destructive action is never disguised as a quiet one; only
   the press is gated." The prose is the sentence that RULES; the script is a
   demo's convenience. Delete therefore keeps `variant="destructive"` at all
   times and the PRESS is gated (`aria-disabled`, click swallowed) until the
   word matches. ARCHIVE has no such prose and its script and prose agree, so
   its confirm genuinely swaps fills: quiet until the reason holds something,
   mango after — which is also why archiving is visibly the softer act.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · LAW 5 — NAME THE RECORD. The title is assembled "Delete 4182 — Record
     title goes here?"; "Delete this item?" is not a kwapso dialog.
   · ONE BUTTON ORDER. Context (the hint) left, Keep, then the deciding
     button furthest right. `AlertDialogFooter` already draws it.
   · THE MODAL IS THE KIT'S ONE MODAL. `AlertDialog` — no close chip, no
     dismiss-on-scrim, Escape routes to Keep. Below 45rem it is the kit's
     bottom sheet (ruling W1's side rule and 27.4's own narrow render).
   · NEVER RED TEXT, NEVER A RED OUTLINE. The destructive fill comes whole
     from `buttonVariants({ variant: "destructive" })`.
   · EVERY STRING IS A PROP with the artifact's drawn value as its default.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. Controlled/uncontrolled confirm text, a media query hook.
