   FilterBuilderScreen — composition 27.33.

   THE ONE SENTENCE
   "What opens behind '+ filter' when one chip is not enough. It is a panel
   over the collection, it reads as prose, and its output is either the
   toolbar's chips or a saved view that becomes a tab."
   (The kit's own sentence says "folder tab"; the folder tab variant was
   retired on 2026-09-02 and a saved view becomes a line tab now. The
   MECHANIC — a saved view arrives on the strip — is untouched.)

   DESIGN SOURCE — "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" chapter 27.33, verbatim:

     IT READS AS A SENTENCE
       "Where · field · operator · value, then 'and' down the left. A filter a
        person can read aloud is a filter they can check; a grid of unlabelled
        dropdowns is not."

     THE MATCH COUNT IS LIVE AND STATED
       "Top right of the panel and on the commit button: 6 of 24 match. Nobody
        should have to apply a filter to find out it returns nothing — that is
        what 27.22 is for, and it should be rare."

     NO GROUPS, NO "OR"
       "Conditions only ever narrow. Nested groups and mixed and/or are
        deliberately out of scope: two saved views are clearer than one filter
        nobody but its author can read."

     ITS OUTPUT IS CHIPS OR A TAB
       "Show applies it as toolbar chips. Save as a tab turns it into a folder
        tab on this collection for everyone — which is how the tab set grows,
        and why saving says who it affects."

     REMOVING IS ONE PRESS PER ROW
       "Each condition carries its own ×, and the toolbar chip says '3
        conditions' with an × that clears the lot. Nothing is only removable
        by re-opening the builder."

     NARROW STACKS, KEEPS THE COUNT
       "Below 720px each condition becomes a card of three stacked fields; the
        match count and Show sit at the bottom in the usual order, context
        left and commit right."

     DOORS DIFFER
       "The portal has search and its three tabs, and no builder — a client
        filtering their own dozen requests is a scroll, not a query."

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · IT READS AS A SENTENCE, AND THE SENTENCE IS IN THE DOM. Where · field ·
     operator · value, in that order, with "and" leading every row after the
     first. The conjunction is a word in tertiary ink in its own column, not
     a control: there is nothing to choose, because there is no "or".
   · NO GROUPS, NO "OR" — AND NO PROP THAT COULD ADD ONE. There is no
     `conjunction` on `FilterCondition`, no `children` on it, and no nesting
     in the type. The out-of-scope sentence is printed on the screen as well,
     because a reader looking for the missing control should find the answer
     rather than the absence.
   · THE COUNT IS LIVE, STATED TWICE, AND NEVER GUESSED. `matchCount` and
     `totalCount` come from the application — this screen counts nothing
     itself — and are drawn top right of the panel and again on the commit
     control. A builder that computed its own count would be lying whenever
     the query and the list disagreed.
   · REMOVING IS ONE PRESS PER ROW. Every condition owns an ×; the toolbar
     chip owns the × that clears the lot. Both are always drawn.
   · SAVING SAYS WHO IT AFFECTS. "Saving adds a tab for everyone on this
     collection" sits beside the control that does it, not in a confirmation
     after the fact. (The kit wrote "folder tab"; see the head.)
   · ONE MANGO, AND IT IS "Show 6". Clear is a text button and Save as a tab
     is paper: saving is not the primary act, applying is.
   · THERE IS NO `door` PROP. The portal has no builder.
   · EVERY STRING IS A PROP with a default (PATTERN §7).
   · No CSS `border`, no px, no literal colour, no gradient, no illustration.
   · Focus is one global rule. Dark is a token flip.

   THE COLLECTION BEHIND THE PANEL IS A MAIN SCREEN, AND IT IS DRAWN AS ONE
   THIS COMPOSITION AS A WHOLE IS NEITHER OF THE TWO SCREENS — 27.33 is "a
   panel over the collection", and the panel is the subject. But the
   collection UNDER it is an ordinary main screen: it is in the navbar, it has
   an eyebrow with a count, tabs and a toolbar. So it is drawn by
   `MainScreen` rather than assembled here.

   It used to hand `eyebrow` and `heading` straight to a bare
   `CollectionFrame`. That is 26.03's anatomy diagram, not a screen: it draws
   level 4 (the panel) and the off-beige ground under it, and simply omits
   level 1 (the page), level 2 (the soft-paper SCREEN CARD) and the header
   band that lies on it. `SHELL.md` is the law being followed — "the eyebrow
   and the title are in the HEADER BAND, on the screen card's soft paper" —
   and `MainScreen`'s own header says why a route may not shortcut it: "this
   file does not simply hand `CollectionFrame` a heading."

   DO NOT PUT IT BACK. No route paints its own idea of the page; the four
   levels are written down in exactly one place, `screen-shell.tsx`, and
   reaching past `MainScreen` to `CollectionFrame` is how they went missing
   the first time. The PANEL is untouched by this and stays what it is,
   including the side it rises from — see the next block.

   THE TOOLBAR'S CONTROLS GO TO `toolbarActions`, NOT `actions`. On
   `MainScreen` those are two different rows: `actions` is the HEADER BAND's
   cluster, one level up on the screen card, and `toolbarActions` is the
   panel's own inline end. Export and the collection's `+` are the toolbar's,
   which is where `CollectionFrame`'s `actions` slot always put them, so the
   re-base keeps them where they were drawn. `SHELL.md`: "the page header's `+`
   is mango; the collection panel's own `+` is charcoal" — this screen's one
   mango is "Show 6" in the panel, so no `onCreate` is passed and the header
   band draws no `+` at all.

   Two of `MainScreen`'s slots are deliberately NOT used here. `meta` is a
   description line under the heading and 27.33 draws none. `panel={false}`
   would remove the soft-paper panel and with it the toolbar and the folder
   tabs — which is where this screen's search field, its "3 conditions" chip
   and its `+ filter` live.

   WHY THE PANEL RISES FROM THE BOTTOM RATHER THAN THE SIDE
   The chapter calls it "a panel over the collection" and gives it no side and
   no measure. The kit's side drawer is 26.25rem, and the sentence this panel
   exists to draw — Where · field · operator · value · × — cannot be read at
   that width: every control crushes to two characters and an ellipsis, which
   is precisely the "grid of unlabelled dropdowns" the chapter is arguing
   against. The bottom sheet is the kit's other panel and it is full width, so
   the sentence reads left to right on a desktop and stacks into cards at 380
   exactly as the artifact draws it — and no width is invented to get there.
   The collection stays visible above it either way. Logged as T3B-12 in
   GAPS-TRACK3B.md: if the client wants the drawer, the drawer needs a second,
   wider measure and that is a kwapso value nobody has stated.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. A media subscription, Radix `Sheet`, and the condition
   handlers built during this module's own render.

 * The filter builder, over its collection.

 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — the collection, the chip in its toolbar, and the panel
 *                      over it with the sentence in it.
 *  2. hover          — the controls'. Nothing here draws a wash.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *  4. active/pressed — `Button`'s, `Select`'s and `Input`'s.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. A field the reader may not filter on
 *                      is not in `fields` (ch24.6), never a dimmed option.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply to the builder. The FIELD LIST is known
 *                      before the panel opens; the match count arriving late
 *                      is the count's own business and the application holds
 *                      it. Nothing here spins.
 *  7. empty          — NO CONDITIONS: the sentence is just the add control and
 *                      the two notes. The panel is not blanked and no register
 *                      is drawn — an empty builder is a builder waiting, not a
 *                      builder with nothing to say.
 *  8. error          — does not apply. A filter cannot fail; a filter that
 *                      matches nothing is 27.22, on the collection behind,
 *                      and the live count exists so it is seen before it is
 *                      applied.
 *  9. selected       — the chosen field, operator and value on each row, each
 *                      drawn by its own control with a real ARIA state.
 * 10. read-only      — a reader with no filter right is passed no handlers,
 *                      so the toolbar's Filter control is absent.
 *
 * NARROW (380px), STATED — the artifact's own second render
 *  · ONE CONDITION PER CARD. Below 45rem each row becomes a card of stacked
 *    fields: the conjunction and the × on the first line, then field,
 *    operator and value beneath. The sentence still reads top to bottom,
 *    which is the order it reads in at every width.
 *  · THE MATCH COUNT IS PINNED, AND IT MOVES. On desktop it sits top right of
 *    the panel; at 380 it moves into the footer beside the commit — "context
 *    left and commit right" — where it cannot scroll away.
 *  · THE FOOTER IS THE COUNT AND SHOW. Clear and Save as a tab are drawn from
 *    `sm` up, which is what the artifact's narrow render carries. Removal is
 *    not lost with them: each condition keeps its ×, and so does the toolbar
 *    chip.
 *  · THE PANEL IS THE SAME BOTTOM SHEET AT BOTH WIDTHS; what changes inside it
 *    is the sentence, which stacks into cards. The collection stays above it.
 *  · THE TOOLBAR CONDENSES. The chip and its × stay; the search field takes
 *    its own line. Nothing about removing a condition needs the panel.
 *  · BOTH NOTES STAY. The out-of-scope sentence and the who-it-affects
 *    sentence are the two questions this panel gets asked, at any width.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling.
