/* ============================================================================
   List — the primary collection row (7 direct call sites).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   Two drawings, both the kit's, and neither is a skin of the other:

     · design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-ui.css → `.kw-list`, `.kw-list__item`,
       `.kw-list__well`, `.kw-list__body`, `.kw-list__title`, `.kw-list__meta`
       — a flex column of rows, each `--space-4`/`--space-5` inset at
       `--radius-card`, hovering to a paper tone; a 32 pill "well" holding a
       mark; the title at `--text-body-s`/`--weight-strong` and the meta at
       `--text-caption`/`--ink-tertiary`. That is `variant="rows"`.

     · "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" → chapter 17 "Tables & lists", the two
       specimens headed "List rows — comfortable" and "List rows — compact",
       inside a `--card` box at radius 24 with `inset 0 -1px 0 var(--hair)`
       under every row but the last. That is `variant="panel"`, the default.

   Chapter 17's own spec line is quoted verbatim because it settles three
   numbers at once:

       "Header 11px/500 uppercase · rows 56px comfortable / 44px compact ·
        8% hairline under each row · first column is always the record name ·
        row action pinned right"

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · THE ROW IS 56 COMFORTABLE, 44 COMPACT. `--control-height-row` and
     `--control-height-input`, both kit-stated, both fixed at every width.
     They are minimums, not clips: a wrapped title grows the row.
   · The hairline under a row is the 8% one (`--border`), not the heavy
     `--hair-strong` — that weight is a SECTION rule and belongs to `Title`
     and to a table's header. The last row drops its rule, so a list never
     ends on a line separating it from nothing.
   · Hover is `--accent`, the neutral row wash, timed by
     motion.css `.motion-row-hover`. NEVER `--primary`: mango is a brand
     fill, and a hovered list would otherwise go mango row by row. The kit's
     own `.kw-list__item:hover` names `--surface-panel`, which is a different
     answer — see GAPS-COL3 LST-2 for why `--accent` was taken instead.
   · Selected is `--surface-selected` (override 44; `--surface-panel` until
     the K1 reversal put that paper under the rows), exactly as `TableRow`
     resolves it, and it does not change again on hover: it is already the
     loudest row on screen.
   · Disabled is a fill and an ink (`--btn-disabled-fill` /
     `--btn-disabled-label`) with the hover dropped, never an opacity.
   · The exclusive states are resolved in JS and emitted as ONE class set
     (PATTERN §4). Precedence: disabled > selected > default.
   · The mark is `Avatar` and the counts are `Badge`. Neither is redrawn
     here — the well is `Avatar variant="quiet"`, which is the same hairline
     fill `.kw-list__well` names.
   · Only four radii. Focus is one global rule (tokens.css §8).

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. A pressable row means this module builds an event handler
   during its own render, and `Avatar` is Radix-shaped underneath.

/**
 * The system's collection row.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — a row per record at the density's geometry, on the 8%
 *                      hairline, the last one without it.
 *  2. hover          — `bg-accent`, the neutral wash, timed by
 *                      `.motion-row-hover`. Only on a row that is pressable
 *                      and neither selected nor disabled; the precedence is
 *                      resolved in JS so there is no race to lose. A list
 *                      that is not pressable has no hover at all, because a
 *                      page of reacting rows that go nowhere is noise.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      at the row's own radius. Nothing here clips it: the
 *                      `panel` shell keeps `overflow-hidden` OFF and clips
 *                      its corners with the rows' own radius instead — see
 *                      the note at the shell.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply as a skin. Pressing a row navigates,
 *                      and the acknowledgement is the destination arriving.
 *                      The kit draws no pressed list row (GAPS-COL3 LST-4).
 *  5. disabled       — per row, or the whole list: `--btn-disabled-fill` /
 *                      `--btn-disabled-label`, `aria-disabled`, no hover, and
 *                      the row is a block rather than a button so there is no
 *                      tab stop that does nothing.
 *  6. loading        — `state="loading"`: the ROWS are replaced with skeleton
 *                      lines and the shell stays, so the page does not jump
 *                      when the records land. ch24.4: "Never a spinner where
 *                      a shape is known."
 *  7. empty          — `state="empty"`, or `rows: []`, draws chapter 21's
 *                      register inside the shell. A list with no rows and no
 *                      register renders `null` rather than an empty box.
 *  8. error          — `state="error"`: the register in its error tone,
 *                      `role="alert"`. Never a poppy row: colour belongs on
 *                      the pill in the row, not smeared across it.
 *  9. selected       — `--surface-selected` and `aria-selected`, and it does not
 *                      change again on hover.
 * 10. read-only      — always. A list shows values; it never edits one. An
 *                      editable row is `data-table`'s job.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile   — the row keeps its height and its parts. The TITLE COLUMN
 *             shrinks and truncates (`min-w-0` + `truncate`), the trailing
 *             meta and action stay whole. That is the right sacrifice: a
 *             record's name can be cut and still recognised, whereas a
 *             half-visible state pill or a cut-off action is useless. The
 *             row never restacks into two lines, because a two-line row at
 *             44 or 56 either overflows its own height or abandons a stated
 *             number, and both are worse than a truncated name.
 *  tablet   — unchanged.
 *  desktop  — unchanged. The kit states one geometry per density at every
 *             width; the list fills the column its parent gives it.
 *
 * RTL — safe. Every inset is `px-*`/`py-*`, the trailing group is pushed with
 * `ms-auto` (margin-inline-start), the leading mark is first in DOM order and
 * therefore at the reading start in Arabic, Urdu and Persian, and no rule in
 * this file names a physical side.
