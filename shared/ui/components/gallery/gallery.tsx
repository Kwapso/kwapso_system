/* ============================================================================
   Gallery — the one view where an image leads.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   `KWAPSO-SPEC.md` CH19 view 11 and CH27.28 "Gallery · For records whose
   content is a picture". CH27.28's rules are the brief, verbatim:

       "Offered only where images exist — Gallery appears in the view switcher
        for deliverables, assets and screens. It is never offered for tickets,
        accounts or sprints — an image-led view of text records is a grid of
        empty boxes pretending to be content."

       "One ratio, no cropping surprises — Every tile is 16:9 with the image
        contained, corners at the 24 radius, and the caption below it. Portrait
        assets letterbox onto paper rather than being cropped to fill — the
        brand shows the whole artefact."

       "The caption is a row, not a paragraph — Title on one line with an
        ellipsis, then one line carrying the status pill and the age. Two lines
        maximum under any tile, so the grid stays a grid."

       "No image is a state, not a placeholder — A record with nothing attached
        shows its title on soft paper at the same tile size — never a camera
        glyph, never a dashed box, never a mango 'upload' prompt in the grid."

       "The grid fills, it does not stretch — Columns are auto-filled at a 200
        minimum, so the tile size stays constant and the number of columns
        changes with the window. A tile never grows to 400 because there are
        only two records."

       "Narrow goes two-up — Below 720 the grid is two columns with a shorter
        image and a two-line caption; below 420 it is one. The image shrinks,
        the type does not."

   CH27.28's drawn value is the grid itself:

       grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr))

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · `auto-fill`, NOT `auto-fit`. The two differ in exactly the case CH27.28
     rules on: `auto-fit` collapses the empty tracks and lets two tiles stretch
     across the whole row, which is the "never grows to 400" the chapter
     forbids. `CardGrid`'s `fluid` is `auto-fit`, so it is not used here — the
     wall in this file is a template, not a second card. Logged as
     GAPS-TRACK2A GAL-1.
   · THE PICTURE FILLS THE TILE. `Image` at 16:9 on its own `cover` default.

     This bullet read the other way until 2026-09-09, and the reversal is the
     one thing in this file a reader should not skim. CH27.28 states, by name:
     *"Portrait assets letterbox onto paper rather than being cropped to
     fill"*, and this component obeyed it with `fit="contain"`. The client
     overruled the sentence: *"everywhere for images: do fill, not fit!"* —
     with a wide asset losing its ends given as the INTENDED consequence, not
     as a cost to design around. A later client ruling beats the artifact;
     that is the same order of precedence every override in `KWAPSO-SPEC.md`
     is recorded under, and it is why this is a change and not a defect.

     It is also the bullet above finally agreeing with itself. CH27.28's own
     grid sentence is *"the grid fills, it does not stretch — a tile never
     grows to 400"*: the whole point of `auto-fill` at a 200 minimum is that
     every tile is the SAME BOX. A wall of identical boxes, each holding a
     differently-shaped picture floating on quiet paper, is a ragged wall with
     tidy geometry underneath it — the grid was constant and the thing a
     reader actually scans was not. Cover makes the picture the same shape as
     the box that was already constant.

     WHAT IT COSTS, stated rather than buried: a portrait asset now shows its
     middle. The chapter's worry — *"cover would cut a face out of the
     frame"* — is real and is not answered by this note; it is answered by
     the ruling, which chose the trade knowingly. `Image` still takes
     `fit="contain"`, so a gallery that must letterbox is one prop away
     (`fit` is not passed through here; see the note at the call site).
   · NO PLACEHOLDER GLYPH. A tile with no picture draws its own title on soft
     paper, at the same 16:9 box. It is `aria-hidden`, because the caption
     under it already carries the title and a screen reader must not hear the
     name of the record twice; the stand-in is a picture of the words, not a
     second label.
   · THE CAPTION IS TWO LINES, HARD. Title on one line with an ellipsis; then
     one line for the status pill and the age. Nothing else fits under a tile.
   · The tile is `Card` and the picture is `Image`. Neither is redrawn: the
     radius, the fill, the hover lift, the picture's own loading and failure
     registers are all theirs.
   · Radii: 24 on the tile and on the media box. Nothing else.
   · Never mango — including for the missing-image state, which CH27.28 names.
   · Focus is one global rule (tokens.css §8). No `border` property, no
     opacity, rem only, LTR only.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. A pressable tile means a handler is built during this
   module's own render, and `Image` and `Card` are both client components.

/**
 * A wall of picture-led records.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — tiles at one ratio in an auto-filled grid, each with a
 *                      two-line caption under it.
 *  2. hover          — the TILE's, via `Card interactive`: the `--accent` wash
 *                      and `.motion-hover-lift`. The picture itself does not
 *                      move, zoom or dim — CH35 puts photography under type,
 *                      and a picture that scaled under the pointer would be
 *                      the scrim rule broken by motion instead of colour.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once, at
 *                      the tile's own 24. The wall sets no `overflow: hidden`.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply as a skin. Pressing a tile opens the
 *                      record.
 *  5. disabled       — per tile: `--btn-disabled-fill` /
 *                      `--btn-disabled-label`, `aria-disabled`, no hover, no
 *                      tab stop that does nothing. A fill and an ink.
 *  6. loading        — `loading`: `Skeleton variant="media"` in the same grid
 *                      at the same ratio, so the placeholder wall is the shape
 *                      of the real one and nothing reflows on arrival.
 *  7. empty          — no tiles, or `empty`: the quiet register across the
 *                      whole wall. Distinct from a tile with no picture, which
 *                      is a normal tile and NOT a register — CH27.28 makes the
 *                      distinction itself.
 *  8. error          — `error`: the register with a poppy dot, also across the
 *                      whole wall. A single PICTURE that failed is `Image`'s
 *                      own register inside its tile, and the tile stays.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. The kit draws no selected card
 *                      (GAPS-F CRD-3) and a gallery may not invent one.
 * 10. read-only      — without `onTileSelect` the wall is read-only.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS — and here the answer is CH27.28's own, at its own two
 * thresholds rather than Tailwind's.
 *  · base, to 26.25rem (the kit's 420) — ONE column. "Below 420 it is one."
 *  · 26.25rem to 45rem (the kit's 720) — TWO columns, fixed, not auto-filled:
 *    "below 720 the grid is two columns with a shorter image". The image
 *    shrinks with the column because the ratio is fixed; the type does not,
 *    because nothing here scales a type step.
 *  · 45rem and up — the auto-filled grid at the 200 minimum. The tile size
 *    stays constant and the COLUMN COUNT changes with the window.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only (ruling 10). Every inset is logical, the grid's order follows
 * the document and no rule names a side.
