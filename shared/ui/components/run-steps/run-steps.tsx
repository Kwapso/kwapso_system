/* ============================================================================
   RunSteps — a sequence executing, with per-step state (1 direct call site).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   Three parts of the kit, and all three are named:

     · "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" → chapter 19's `checklist` view, whose own
       catalogue entry reads verbatim:
           "checklist — Ordered steps with owner and sign-off ·
            Audits, handover, go-live · Steps"
       and whose row is drawn as a two-digit number, a title, an owner and a
       time. The chapter's `steps` view is its sibling: "Ordered stages with
       a progress bar".
     · Chapter 15's "Stepper — programme phases": four equal columns, a 26
       mark over a hairline connector, the label beneath. That is already
       transcribed into `status-stepper.tsx` as `variant="steps"`, and this
       file COMPOSES it for the rail rather than drawing a second one.
     · Chapter 07's state matrix, Loading row — "700ms spin / 1.4s bar" —
       which is `spinner.tsx`. A step that is RUNNING carries the kit's 22
       ring; nothing else in this file turns.

   ch27.44 "Import proposal" is the composition this component was built for:
   "Overlay screen · steps down the side · approve is a press".

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · THE RAIL IS `StatusStepper`, THE RING IS `Spinner`. Not one stage class
     and not one keyframe is written here. If a mark needed a fill this file
     did not have, that would be a gap to log, not a class to invent.
   · POPPY MEANS BLOCKED. A failed step takes `Badge variant="destructive"`
     — colour on the pill, never smeared across the row (ruling 26: "colour
     is the whole treatment"). The row itself keeps its paper, and the words
     always say what happened; the mark never carries it alone.
   · `--warning` IS a colour as of 2026-09-02 — the client's new orange
     (tokens.css §3) — where this line used to say it was the quiet chip. A
     SKIPPED step still does not reach for it, and now for the reason rather
     than for want of anything better: skipped is not a warning, it is a
     stage that did not run. Skipped stays the quiet fill with disabled ink,
     which is exactly how the kit already draws a stage that is not the
     present.
   · A step that has not started renders its NUMBER, not a zero and not a
     dash — the same two-digit tabular figure `StatusStepper` formats.
   · Disabled is a fill and an ink. Hover is a token. Never an opacity.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). A pressable step is a real
     button and takes the ring at its own radius.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. A pressable step means this module builds an event handler
   during its own render, and `StatusStepper` is a client module.

/* The five marks. Each is a fill and an ink — never an opacity — and each is
   the fill the kit already uses for that meaning:
     done     — the inverse mark chapter 15 draws for a completed phase
     running  — MANGO with a charcoal glyph, AND IT STAYS THERE. This line
                used to justify itself by pointing at the rail: both of the
                artifact's steppers filled the CURRENT mark that way (CH19
                view 17's `stepColors` gives `current: [MANGO, ONACC]`, CH15
                draws `background: var(--mango)` with `color: #1A1918`), and
                `StatusStepper` did the same on the rail, so matching it was
                how the row and the rail stopped disagreeing.

                THAT RAIL HAS MOVED, AND THIS MARK IS NOT FOLLOWING IT.
                Aurora ruled twice on 23 Sep 2026 — "on ticket stages, mark
                the active and past in black, only future are gray", then,
                reviewing the result, "remove the numbers inside (they are
                not numbered) is either check or empty". `StatusStepper
                variant="steps"` now draws done AND current as one ink circle
                with a `CheckFat` tick, and a later stage as an empty grey
                circle. There is no mango left on that rail and no number
                anywhere on it. This mark deliberately diverges, for three
                reasons:

                  · HER RULINGS NAME STAGES, AND A RUN IS NOT A PROGRESSION.
                    Both are scoped by their own words — "on ticket stages",
                    and "the stages are not numbered". The pass that made the
                    change read that scope narrowly enough to leave the
                    `stages` pill alone INSIDE `StatusStepper` itself, and
                    filed the question back to her rather than acting on it.
                    Carrying the ruling across into a different component's
                    five-state EXECUTION mark is a longer reach than the one
                    that pass already declined to make.
                  · THE SECOND RULING'S PREMISE IS FALSE HERE. "They are not
                    numbered" is what killed the number on the rail. A run
                    step IS numbered: CH19 view 17's row is specified as "a
                    two-digit number, a title, an owner and a time", which is
                    why the `pending` mark below still prints that figure. A
                    rule whose stated reason does not hold cannot be applied
                    by its conclusion alone.
                  · INK WOULD COST MORE THAN THE MANGO DOES. `done` is
                    already the ink circle. Painting `running` ink too would
                    leave the two told apart by GLYPH ALONE — tick versus
                    ring — which is exactly the distinction she struck down
                    on the rail. The ring moves, which is a stronger signal
                    than a static glyph, but it would still mean the one step
                    that is HAPPENING is filled the same as every step that
                    has already finished.

                The colour is also licensed here in a way it is not on the
                rail: this mark carries meaning by fill ALREADY — `failed` is
                poppy, two lines down — because a run mark reports a STATE
                where a rail mark reports a POSITION. Override 17 still
                covers the count: a mark is not an ACTION, and only actions
                are counted. The `Spinner` inside it keeps the ring, which is
                still the only thing on the row that moves.

                IF SHE RULES OTHERWISE, this is the whole edit: `running`
                takes `bg-surface-inverse text-ink-on-inverse` like `done`,
                and the row loses its only accent.
     failed   — poppy with a CHARCOAL glyph. Never white on red.
     skipped  — the quiet fill with disabled ink: `.kw-stage--later`'s pair
     pending  — raised paper with a hairline and a tertiary number, exactly
                as `StatusStepper variant="steps"` draws a later mark

   THE `skipped` MARK IS A KNOWN DIVERGENCE — do not re-flag it, and do not
   move it alone. GAPS-CONTRAST §2 row 8 names "`run-step-mark` pending" at
   2.335:1 light / 3.979:1 dark. THE LABEL IN THAT ROW IS WRONG: `pending` is
   `--ink-tertiary` on card and measures 6.506 light / 7.928 dark. The mark
   that sits in the exempt tier is `skipped` — one instance in the demo, step
   07, "Archive the source file".

   It stays because it is the SAME OBJECT as a later stage, drawn once. The
   artifact rules that pair directly — CH23's "Later is disabled ink, not
   hidden" — and this line takes it deliberately so the run row and the
   stepper rail do not draw one meaning two ways, which is the drift this
   file was already corrected for once (see `running`, above). Unlike the
   other four members of that family, no chapter names a SKIPPED run step, so
   this is a DERIVATION from `.kw-stage--later`, labelled one, and cheaper to
   overturn than any of them. If CH23's pair ever moves to tertiary, this
   moves with it in the same edit.

   What is actually at risk is small and worth stating: the mark carries only
   the ordinal, and the row's own label and description — "Skipped: the file
   came from a connector, not an upload" — are in full ink and unaffected. */

     that reading broke on 23 Sep 2026. The rail drew `current` as a mango
     circle carrying the stage's number, which said WHERE the run was and
     stayed silent on the outcome. Aurora's two rulings that day (quoted in
     the `running` note above) turned `current` into the same ink circle with
     the same `CheckFat` tick that `done` draws. Left alone, a failed step
     would now be marked on the rail with a TICK — the rail asserting the
     step succeeded, directly above a row drawing it poppy with a destructive
     Badge and the word "Failed".

     `later` is the only one of the rail's three positions that does not lie
     about it: the empty grey circle, not reached and not completed. Every
     step after the failure is `later` too, so the rail reads exactly what
     happened — the run got this far and stopped. The cost is that the rail
     carries no `aria-current` while a run is failed, and that matches the
     rows, which only set `aria-current="step"` on `running`; a failed run
     already had no current row to point at.

     `skipped` KEEPS `done` and therefore keeps its tick. That pairing
     predates both rulings and is argued on its own terms above — a skipped
     step is behind the run — so it is not something this change broke. It is
     the weaker of the two claims and worth her eye, but moving it is not
     this pass's call. */

/**
 * A sequence executing.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — the rail, then one row per step: mark, label,
 *                      description, meta.
 *  2. hover          — only on a pressable row, and then it is `--accent`,
 *                      the neutral wash, timed by `.motion-row-hover`. Never
 *                      mango, never an opacity, and never on the running row
 *                      — that row already carries the loudest fill on screen
 *                      and a hover on top of it would say nothing.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *                      Nothing here sets `overflow: hidden`, so a pressed
 *                      row's ring shows in full at the row's own radius.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply as a skin. Pressing a step opens its
 *                      detail; the acknowledgement is the detail arriving.
 *  5. disabled       — per step or whole run: `--btn-disabled-fill` /
 *                      `--btn-disabled-label`, `aria-disabled`, no hover, and
 *                      the row is a block rather than a button so there is no
 *                      tab stop that does nothing.
 *  6. loading        — TWO different things, kept apart. A STEP that is
 *                      running is `state="running"` and carries the kit's
 *                      ring — that is not a loading state, it is the
 *                      component's subject. The SEQUENCE that has not arrived
 *                      is `state="loading"` on the component, and it draws
 *                      skeleton rows with the rail kept, so the page does not
 *                      jump when the steps land.
 *  7. empty          — `state="empty"`, or `steps: []`: chapter 21's
 *                      register, or `null` when there is nothing to say
 *                      either. A run with no steps is not drawn as an empty
 *                      rail.
 *  8. error          — TWO different things again. A STEP that failed is
 *                      `state="failed"`: poppy on the mark and a destructive
 *                      `Badge`, with the words saying what happened — colour
 *                      on the pill, never across the row. On the RAIL it is
 *                      `later`, an empty circle, so the rail stops at the
 *                      failure rather than ticking it off (see `RAIL_STATE`).
 *                      The whole SEQUENCE failing to load is `state="error"`
 *                      and draws the register.
 *  9. selected       — the RUNNING step is the one the reader is on:
 *                      `--surface-panel` and `aria-current="step"`. A run has
 *                      no second notion of selection.
 * 10. read-only      — always. A run reports what is happening; starting,
 *                      retrying and cancelling are Buttons the call site puts
 *                      beside it, not controls this component owns.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile   — the rows keep their shape and the label TRUNCATES; the
 *             description wraps under it. Nothing restacks. The RAIL keeps
 *             its equal columns and ellipsises its labels, which is
 *             `StatusStepper`'s own stated behaviour and the right one:
 *             stacking a rail turns a stepper into a list and loses the
 *             spine that makes it readable as a progression at a glance.
 *  tablet   — unchanged.
 *  desktop  — unchanged. Neither the rail nor the rows change size or count
 *             with width; a run of twelve steps is a run of twelve steps on
 *             a phone, and `StatusStepper` does not fold in its `steps`
 *             variant.
 *
 * RTL — safe. The mark is first in DOM order and therefore at the reading
 * start in Arabic, Urdu and Persian; the tick and the warning glyph are
 * symbols and are not mirrored; the rail's connector fills in reading order
 * because motion.css mirrors its own `transform-origin`; every inset is
 * logical and the meta is pushed with `ms-auto`.
