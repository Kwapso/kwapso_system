/* ============================================================================
   Folder — the kwapso brand silhouette, as one path (new; 0 call sites yet).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   kit chapter 14, "Folder shapes — 9-slice · fixed corners & shoulder,
   stretchable fillers", plus the four brand slices shipped in
   `assets/folder/`. Chapter 24.3 ("Tabs") and 24.6 ("Record chrome") draw the
   same shape as a tab on a real screen and are the source for the tab strip's
   own numbers; chapter 27's collection anatomy states the 47.5 tab height.

   Chapter 14's own drawn markup assembles the shape from six positioned
   slices. THIS FILE DOES NOT. It draws one `<path>`, because a 9-slice made of
   images cannot take `currentColor`, cannot flip with the palette, and loads
   six assets to draw one outline. The path is a transcription of the slices,
   not a redrawing of them: every control point below is lifted verbatim from
   the shipped SVG and reassembled into a single contour.

   THE UNIT, AND WHY THERE IS ONE
   Chapter 14: "Assembled from the six brand slices at a uniform 1.6x scale."
   The slices' own coordinates are therefore the source of truth and 1.6 is the
   bridge to the kit's stated pixels. The rem base is 16, so

       1 brand unit  =  1.6 / 16 rem  =  0.1 rem, exactly.

   Every stated figure in the chapter falls out of that with no rounding:

       tab.svg       247.94 x 56.04   lip      19.05   -> 30.48  ("30.48px lip")
       corner-tr.svg  62.92 x 37      top row  36.99   -> 59.18  ("59.18px")
       corner-bl.svg 247.94 x 39.96   bottom   39.96   -> 63.94  ("63.94px")
       corner-br.svg  62.92 x 39.96   corner   62.92   -> 100.67 ("100.67 wide")
       ch24 tab                       height   29.6875 -> 47.5   ("47.5px")

   One correction falls out of it too. `corner-tr.svg` is 37 units tall, which
   would make the top row 59.20, but the chapter says 59.18 — and 59.18 is
   36.99, which is exactly `tab.svg`'s height below its own shoulder
   (56.04 - 19.05). The tab slice is authoritative and the corner slice is
   0.01 units generous. This file uses neither: the top row is not a number
   here at all, it is whatever is left after the two corner radii.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · The shoulder is a CURVE, never a slant. It is the `S` in tab.svg,
     reversed, control point for control point.
   · The rounded top-left corner always survives. It is drawn at a fixed
     6.6 units at every size and is never in a stretchable run.
   · Only FLAT runs take the width and the height. Every curve is a fixed
     length in brand units, so nothing is ever scaled non-uniformly and the
     viewBox never crops through a curve — chapter 14's two hard rules.
   · Allowed fills are soft paper, off-beige, mango and charcoal. Sky, forest
     and poppy never fill a folder shape, so no status fill exists here.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). Nothing here rings anything and
     nothing sets `outline: none`. The shape is `aria-hidden` and not a target.
   · No px and no hex. The path's numbers are SVG user units in a viewBox,
     which is unitless by definition; every CSS length is a token.

   WHY IT MEASURES
   A single path cannot be stretched by CSS without distorting its curves, and
   `preserveAspectRatio` can only letterbox, not 9-slice. So the viewBox is
   recomputed to the element's own box — the same move `tabs.tsx` already makes
   for its indicator, and for the same reason: the measured number is not a
   design value, it is the size the browser has already computed, so it
   rescales with the text-size control by construction. With the viewBox equal
   to the box, one user unit is one brand unit at every size and the curves
   cannot distort.
