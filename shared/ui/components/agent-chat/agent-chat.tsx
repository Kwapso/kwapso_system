   AgentChat — the assistant conversation, streaming (1 direct call site).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   Kit chapter 20's "The floating layer" block, read out of
   `Design Mothership/kit-current/Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html`. Kept figure for
   figure:

     · the panel head — a 20 mango mark at radius 6, the name at 13 / 500,
                        and a 16×3 pill handle pushed to the inline end
     · a turn         — a `--card` box at radius 24, inset 10/12, a column at
                        gap 5, with the ROLE NAMED above the words at 11.5 in
                        tertiary ink
     · the answer     — 13 / 1.4 in secondary ink
     · the sources    — pills on the panel tone at 11.5, tabular figures
     · the footnote   — 11.5 tertiary, the kit's own English: "Read 4 records
                        · never writes without you"
     · the composer   — a `--card` pill, inset 9/13, ghost text at 12.5

   Motion is `motion/motion.css` §10 ("STREAMING TEXT ARRIVAL"), and its two
   rules are quoted because the second is the one that gets forgotten:

       "(a) EACH ARRIVING CHUNK fades in over --duration-colour with a 4px
            rise. … The component wraps each streamed chunk in an element
            carrying `.motion-stream-chunk`; it must NOT re-render existing
            chunks, or the whole reply re-animates on every token.
        (b) THE CONTAINER MUST NOT ANIMATE ITS OWN HEIGHT while streaming. A
            growing message that eases its height on every chunk fights the
            scroll position and makes the text unreadable."

   Both are obeyed: chunks are keyed by position so React never remounts one,
   and the body carries `.motion-stream-body`, which states `transition:
   none`. The caret is `.motion-stream-caret` and the pre-first-chunk wait is
   three `.motion-thinking-dot`s.

   THE RULINGS THIS FILE IS BOUND BY
   · Ruling 32 — "kwapso ships an assistant, and it reads. Every answer names
     what it read, in words, underneath itself; it never writes without a
     press; and a refusal is a sentence, not an empty panel." All three are
     structural here: `sources` and `footnote` sit UNDER the answer, an
     `actions` slot is the only way a turn can offer to write anything, and a
     refusal is a normal turn carrying a sentence — there is no empty-panel
     branch to fall into.
   · Ruling 33 — "A proposal is not an action … nothing is written until a
     person presses Approve." A turn's `actions` are rendered as controls
     inside the turn, never auto-fired, and `confidence` is carried per source
     so the unsure ones can be surfaced first by the caller.
   · Ruling 31 — the assistant is one of exactly two tenants of the floating
     layer, with no scrim, no blur and no focus trap. That is the SHELL's law
     and the shell is `copilot-overlay`, not this file. This component is the
     conversation and is equally at home in a panel, a sheet or a page.

   OVERRIDE 25 (2026-08-23) — RULING 36 WINS, AND THIS FILE TAKES THE BUBBLE
   Ruling 36, verbatim: "Threads are yours-right on the charcoal fill,
   theirs-left on paper, avatars outside, 62% maximum width." CH20 drew both
   turns as the same `--card` box at full panel width with the role named in
   words above the text, and the build shipped both on purpose — CH20 here,
   ruling 36 in `chat.tsx`. The client ruled for ruling 36, so this file now
   wears the same skin as a person-to-person thread. GAPS-COL1 AC-1 is closed.

   WHAT THAT DECIDED, IN THE CLIENT'S OWN TERMS: the assistant takes the PAPER
   side and YOU take charcoal, so the charcoal fill still means "a person, and
   that person is you". A machine never wears the fill a person wears.

   THE 62% IS A WIDTH, NOT A MEASURE. Ruling 36's cap is 62 PER CENT of the
   thread; `--measure-body` is a character count — 62 when this was written,
   66 since override 31 (2026-08-23), and never the same rule as the per-cent.
   The two numbers used to read alike, which is exactly why the confusion was
   worth writing down; they now do not, and the argument is unchanged. The
   turn column's old
   `lg:max-w-[var(--measure-body)]` is therefore gone — kept beside a 62% cap
   it would have squeezed an answer to about forty characters a line. Whether
   the assistant's turn should ALSO be capped at the reading measure is open
   and unruled; it is logged, not guessed.

   THE ROLE IS STILL NAMED, FOR A SCREEN READER ONLY. Ruling 36 draws no name
   line, so "You" / "Assistant" is `sr-only`. The side and the fill are what a
   sighted reader reads; a screen reader gets the word, because a thread whose
   only signal is a colour would announce two identical paragraphs.

/* ============================================================================
   RULING D7-2 = 2A, 2026-08-24 — THE CITATION FORMAT
   ============================================================================
   CH27's closing paragraph owed "a citation format for assistant answers", and
   `verify/open.html` §C21 said what was missing was not the pill — the pill was
   already drawn — but WHAT A CITATION SAYS: "until the format is ruled, every
   application that wires the assistant will invent its own, and they will not
   match."

   The client ruled `D7-2 numbered`, which is `verify/decide-2.html` §D7's
   proposal 2A, drawn there as:

     · a SUPERSCRIPT MARK where the claim is made — "Three of the four overdue
       invoices are on the Ostwald retainer¹, and the retainer's own cap was
       raised on 12 August²" — at `--text-micro`, weight medium, raised.
     · a NUMBERED PILL under the turn — "1 · Invoices · 4 rows" — the same
       chip the kit already draws, with the number in front.

   and the page's `.ask` fixed the other half in the same breath: "Either way I
   will also fix the pill's TEXT to one shape — `collection · record` — which
   is the half of this that stops every application inventing its own."

   SO THE FORMAT IS A TYPE, NOT A CONVENTION. `label` is GONE. A source is a
   `collection` and a `record`, both required, and the pill renders them in
   that order with the artifact's middot between them. A caller cannot pass a
   sentence, a filename or a URL as "the label" any more, because there is no
   label to pass. That is the whole point of the ruling and a doc comment
   would not have carried it.

   THE NUMBER IS DERIVED, NEVER AUTHORED. It is the source's 1-based position
   in the turn's own `sources` array, so the mark in the prose and the pill
   under it cannot disagree — which is exactly what would happen if a caller
   numbered them by hand and then re-ordered the array.

   `Cite` IS HOW THE PROSE REACHES THE NUMBER. It takes the source's `id`, not
   a number: `<Cite for="s-2" />`. It reads the turn's sources from context and
   renders the mark for whatever position that source is currently in. A `for`
   that names no source of this turn renders NOTHING and warns in development
   — a superscript pointing at a citation that is not underneath the answer is
   worse than no superscript.

   WHAT A SCREEN READER GETS, WHICH IS NOT A BARE NUMBER
   The mark announces "Source 2" rather than "2"; the pill announces "Source 2:
   Ostwald · Retainer" rather than "2 Ostwald Retainer". Both words come from
   `citationLabel`, one prop with one default, because the applications run in
   more than one language. The middots are `aria-hidden` — they are punctuation
   between two named things, not content.

   WHAT WAS DRAWN AND IS DELIBERATELY NOT BUILT
   2A's "Made of" line offers `HoverCard` "for the preview on the pill". The
   drawing shows no preview and the ruling is about what a citation SAYS, so
   the hover card is not built. A pill with an `href` is a link, as before.

         16 Sep 2026: "Restore sentence-level citations in KB responses, fix
         numbering/text overlap on smaller screens." The numbered marks were
         pulled once already because the number collided with the line
         above it on narrow screens; the ruling was to fix the overlap, not
         drop the feature again.
         `align-super` was the collider: it wins the UA `vertical-align` back
         from the kit's own `sup`/`sub` reset (`vertical-align: baseline`,
         `line-height: 0`) to the browser's `super`, and `text-micro` here
         re-asserts a real line-height (`--text-micro--line-height: 1.3`) on
         top of that reset's `line-height: 0` — so the mark is raised by
         BOTH the reset's `position:relative;top` offset and the browser's
         own super shift, inside a line box that is no longer pinned to
         zero. On a sentence tightly wrapped at 375px that is enough to
         plant the number on top of the line above. `top-[-0.35em]` raises
         the glyph by roughly the same visual amount `align-super` did,
         `leading-[0]` puts the line-height back to the reset's zero (the
         trailing utility wins over `text-micro`'s own, the same order
         `turnVariants` already relies on for `text-caption
         leading-[var(--leading-normal)]` above), and dropping
         `align-super` leaves `vertical-align: baseline` in force, so the
         mark is offset by position alone and never inflates the row it
         sits in — see `verify/agent-chat-cite/`, which measures two
         adjacent wrapped lines' boxes at 375px and asserts they don't

 *                      `--surface-quiet`; a bubble does not. A conversation
 *                      whose every turn lit up as you read down it would be
 *                      unreadable, and a bubble is not a target.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      at the control's own radius. The send or stop control,
 *                      a source link and every action inside a turn are all
 *                      real controls already. The composer is §8's OTHER
 *                      case: a decorated pill around a bare field, so it
 *                      carries `data-focus-shell` and its Textarea carries
 *                      `data-focus-proxy` and the ring lands on the pill.
 *                      Still §8's one rule; this file writes no ring.
 *  4. active/pressed — belongs to the controls: the 1-hairline nudge every
 *                      Button carries.
 *  5. disabled       — `disabled` on the composer: the field takes the
 *                      disabled skin and the send control takes
 *                      `--btn-disabled-fill` / `--btn-disabled-label`. A fill
 *                      and an ink. A TURN is never disabled — what was said
 *                      was said.
 *  6. loading        — three genuinely different waits, and conflating them
 *                      is the usual bug:
 *                        · `loading` — the CONVERSATION is arriving from
 *                          storage. Skeleton turns, cold cache only.
 *                        · `thinking` — the request is out and nothing has
 *                          come back. Three breathing dots as their own turn,
 *                          on the skeleton's rhythm, because it is the same
 *                          event: waiting. It sits on the assistant's side,
 *                          in the assistant's bubble, behind the assistant's
 *                          mark — a wait that changed sides would read as a
 *                          second speaker.
 *                        · `streaming` — text is arriving. The caret blinks
 *                          at the end of the last answer; each chunk rises 4
 *                          and fades in once; the body's height is immediate.
 *  7. empty          — no messages: the quiet register, with the composer
 *                      still mounted. Ruling 32's "a refusal is a sentence,
 *                      not an empty panel" applies to a REFUSAL, which is a
 *                      turn carrying a sentence — there is deliberately no
 *                      code path that turns an answer into an empty panel.
 *  8. error          — two. `error` is the conversation failing to load: the
 *                      register, poppy dot, its own wording. `message.failed`
 *                      is one turn failing or being cut off: a poppy dot
 *                      beside the role and poppy ink on the footnote. Never a
 *                      poppy card — the dot names it and the words say it
 *                      (ruling 26).
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. A bubble is not a choice; where a turn
 *                      OFFERS choices they are `actions`, which are Buttons.
 * 10. read-only      — `composer={false}`. Every turn renders unchanged and
 *                      only the way in is gone, which is the honest read-only
 *                      for a transcript.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  · mobile (base) — the 62% cap opens to 85%, exactly as `chat.tsx` does it:
 *    at 380 a 62% bubble is about 200px of paper with a mark beside it, which
 *    is four words a line. The composer stays one row with the send control
 *    at the 32 dense height inside a 44 pill, clearing the touch row.
 *  · tablet (`sm:`) — the 62% cap takes over. The conversation inherits its
 *    width from whatever holds it — a floating panel, a sheet, a column — and
 *    a bubble that re-flowed on its own would fight that container.
 *  · desktop — UNCHANGED: 62% of whatever holds it, at every width above
 *    `sm:`. The turn column is NO LONGER capped at `--measure-body`; ruling
 *    36's 62% is a percentage of the thread and the measure is a count of
 *    characters, and stacking the two squeezed an answer to roughly forty
 *    characters a line. Whether the assistant's turn should also obey the
 *    reading measure is open (C15's own foot asks it) and is not guessed
 *    here.
 *
 * RTL — safe, and unused: the system is LTR only. Every inset is logical, the
 * head's controls are pushed with `ms-auto`, and the two sides are `self-end`
 * and `self-start` rather than left and right, so the thread mirrors whole.

               inline start — until it has grown.

               THE STADIUM RULE, and it is `chat.tsx`'s own: "a multiline
               composer steps to the box radius, because a pill that has grown
               three lines tall is a stadium." That composer knows it is
               multiline because the call site TOLD it. This one grows on its
               own, so the same fact is measured instead — `autoGrow` reports
               the crossing and the radius follows it. One rule, two ways of
               learning the same thing, and neither component invents a second
               shape.

               THE RING BELONGS TO THIS PILL, NOT TO THE BARE FIELD INSIDE IT.
               The client, 1 Sep 2026, over the assistant's message field:
               "when i select the text field, the 'select' outline is inside?
               should outline the full component! but remember, this should
               only change the color of the outline (like in the add/edit
               screens)." The focusable node here is a BARE `<textarea>`
               (`border-0`, `shadow-none`, no fill and no radius of its own,
               five lines down), so the global ring drew a plain rectangle
               sized to that textarea, sitting inside the rounded pill the
               reader perceives as the field.

               tokens.css §8 already names and solves this shape for every
               OTHER composite control in the kit — the search pill, a facet's
               typed field — and this composer was simply never marked. It is
               marked now: the pill is the shell, the Textarea below is the
               proxy, and the ring follows this element's own radius for free,
               pill or stadium, because an outline always takes the radius of
               the box it is drawn on. No ring is written here; §8 still owns
               the only one. */
