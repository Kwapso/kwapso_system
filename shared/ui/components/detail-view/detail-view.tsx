   DetailView — a record's overview panel.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-patterns.css, CH23. The kit draws this
   shape twice — a record's identity block and the hero band above it — and
   both are transcribed:

     .kw-accountcard        display: flex; flex-direction: column;
                              gap: var(--space-4);
     .kw-accountcard__id    display: flex; align-items: center;
                              gap: var(--space-3);
     .kw-avatar-lg          --avatar-lg (48), pill, --surface-brand /
                              --ink-on-accent, --text-body-s, --weight-strong
     .kw-accountcard__name  --text-body-l (18), --weight-strong
     .kw-accountcard__role  --text-caption, --ink-tertiary
     .kw-accountcard__kv    the label/value grid — `DescriptionList` draws it

     .kw-stagehero          background: var(--surface-panel);
                              border-radius: var(--radius-card);
                              padding: var(--space-6) var(--space-6);
                              display: flex; flex-direction: column;
                              gap: var(--space-3);
     .kw-stagehero__title   --text-h2, --weight-strong, --tracking-h2
     .kw-stagehero__meta    --text-caption, --ink-tertiary

   design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-ui.css → `.kw-empty`;
   kwapso-patterns.css CH21 → `.kw-register`. Both transcribed below.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · THE GROUND IS `--surface-panel`, NOT `--background`. PATTERN §11, ruled
     2026-08-22: in light, `--background`, `--card`, `--surface-raised` and
     `--popover` are the same colour, so a card drawn on the page tone has
     contrast 1.000 against its ground and is held up by its shadow alone.
     This component contains `Card`s, so it lays them on the panel tone — and
     that is also exactly what the kit does, with `.kw-stagehero` on
     `--surface-panel` and `.kw-card .kw-on-panel` sitting on it.
   · THE MARK IS 48 AND STAYS 48. Ruling 30 states three mark sizes
     absolutely, and `avatar.tsx` argues why: a mark's size is WHAT IT IS —
     24 in a dense row, 32 in a list, 48 on a record header. A 48 that shrank
     to 32 on a phone would start meaning "list item" at that width.
   · THE PAIRS ARE `DescriptionList`'S. This file draws no `<dl>`, no label
     ink and no grid; it hands `items` straight to the collection that owns
     that drawing, so a record's pairs and a drawer's pairs cannot diverge.
   · A SECTION IS A `Card`. Its header, its title, its description, its inset
     and its 24 radius are all `card.tsx`'s; none of them is redrawn here.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). Nothing here rings.
   · Disabled is a fill and an ink — and it does not apply, for the reason in
     state 5.
   · Every user-facing string is a prop with a default.
   · No product vocabulary (commission §11). A record, its header, its
     sections, its aside, its footer.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   No `"use client"`. This module holds no hook, no state and no handler of
   its own; the primitives it renders carry their own directives.

   THE ERROR REGISTER IS THE SHARED ONE — `CollectionRegister`.

   CH21's `.kw-register` was declared LOCALLY in six files, byte-for-byte the
   same markup in every one of them, and one record could show two different
   copies of it at once (a `detail-view` rendering a `DescriptionList`). The
   values inside all six were corrected in place on 2026-08-23, so nothing
   drew wrongly; six chances to drift is the defect, and this is the follow-up
   GAPS-FIDELITY-DE L-2 wrote out. `variant="block"` IS `.kw-register` — the
   panel tone at the 24 radius, `--space-7` inset, left-aligned per 27.21 —
   and `tone="error"` is the 7px poppy dot CH21 puts on exactly one of its
   four registers.

   `.kw-empty` STAYS LOCAL, and that is not an oversight. It is a different
   kit object: one line of words at the 14 step in tertiary ink, not an
   eyebrow / title / body / action column. `CollectionRegister`'s `inline`
   variant carries `.kw-empty`'s box but not its step or its ink, so folding
   the two together would either shrink this register's words or hand every
   inline register a container ink its title would inherit. Logged rather
   than forced.

/**
 * A record's overview.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — the panel ground, the header band, the pairs, the
 *                      section cards, the audit footer.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply to the view, and its section cards do
 *                      not take `interactive` either: `card.tsx` states that
 *                      a card which is not a target has no hover, because a
 *                      whole page of reacting boxes is noise. The controls
 *                      inside the header and the sections carry every hover
 *                      there is.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      at the control's own radius. This file sets no
 *                      `overflow: hidden` anywhere, so a ring on a control at
 *                      a card's edge is never shaved.
 *  4. active/pressed — the controls'. A record is not pressed.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply to the view, deliberately. A record the
 *                      reader may not ACT on disables its own controls — each
 *                      of which draws a fill and an ink — and keeps its values
 *                      legible. Greying a whole record hides information for
 *                      no reason, and dimming paper would be an opacity.
 *  6. loading        — `loading`: the frame stays and its parts become
 *                      `Skeleton`s. The title, the subtitle, the mark and each
 *                      section's body are placeholders; `aria-busy` is on the
 *                      root and the empty register is suppressed, because
 *                      "this record is empty" is not yet known.
 *  7. empty          — a record with no pairs, no sections and no children:
 *                      `.kw-empty`, the centred register, INSIDE the frame so
 *                      the header still says which record is empty.
 *  8. error          — `error`: `.kw-register`, the left-aligned panel card —
 *                      a 7 poppy dot, its eyebrow, a title, a sentence and one
 *                      next step. Announced as an alert. It replaces the view,
 *                      because a record that could not be read has no header
 *                      to show either.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. A detail view is the thing that was
 *                      selected; there is nothing further to choose here.
 * 10. read-only      — ALWAYS. This component displays a record. Editing one
 *                      is `Form`, which is a different component on purpose,
 *                      and a call site puts it in a section's `content` or
 *                      behind a control in `actions`.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile   — ONE column. Every section, aside or not, is full width and
 *             reads in order. The header band stays a ROW — the 48 mark plus
 *             a name fits at 320 and stacking it would waste the only width
 *             there is — but the actions WRAP below the name rather than
 *             squeezing beside it. The panel inset is 24.
 *  tablet   — still one column, and this is a decision rather than an
 *             oversight: two columns of record at 48rem gives each about
 *             22rem, which is narrower than the 40ch a paragraph wants. What
 *             tablet gets instead is the header's pairs going to two columns,
 *             which `DescriptionList` does at exactly this width.
 *  desktop  — TWO columns from 64rem, in a 2:1 ratio: the main sections and
 *             the aside. A ratio rather than a measure, so nothing invents a
 *             sidebar width the kit never states (GAPS-COL2 DVW-1). The panel
 *             inset grows to 32, which is the top of the kit's own stated
 *             24–32 range for a card inset.
 *
 * RTL — safe. The grid is on the inline axis and follows the document
 * direction; every inset is `px-*` / `p-*`; the mark leads because it is the
 * first child, not because it is placed at a side. Nothing writes `left`,
 * `right`, `pl-*` or `pr-*`.
