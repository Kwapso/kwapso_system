/* ============================================================================
   CollectionFrame — the shell every list sits in: eyebrow, heading, count,
   figure strip, tabs, and ONE PANEL holding toolbar, rows and pager
   (1 direct call site).

   CLIENT RULING J2 · 2026-08-22 · override register #11 — HALF SPENT ON
   2026-09-02, AND THE OTHER HALF MOVED. Read both paragraphs before restoring
   anything.

   J2 said "a folder tab attaches to a panel", because ruling E had put the
   brand folder shape on every main screen and a folder tab is drawn to be
   pulled DOWN under a panel by `--folder-tab-overlap` and filled with the
   panel's own colour — without a panel it is a shape joined to nothing. THIS
   FRAME NO LONGER DRAWS A FOLDER TAB. The client retired the variant on
   2026-09-02 ("the only tabs that we will have are the line tabs because
   folders will only be used for the breadcrumbs"), so the strip here is a
   `line` strip, attached to nothing by design, and J2's attachment rule has
   nothing to govern in this file. It governs
   `components/breadcrumbs/breadcrumb-folders.tsx` instead, which is the one
   folder strip left and the only place the overlap is still drawn.

   WHAT SURVIVES J2 HERE IS THE ONE PANEL. CH27.1 states the region order and
   the container in one sentence, verbatim:

       "Figures, folder tabs, then the collection panel — toolbar, rows, pager
        inside it. A collection may drop the figure strip; it may not reorder
        what remains, and filters never sit above the tabs."

   The chapter's word for the strip is stale by one client ruling; its ORDER
   and its ONE CONTAINER are not. The toolbar, the body and whatever pager the
   body carries are still not three sibling bands: they are ONE panel,
   `--surface-panel` at `--radius`. What changed is the seam above it — the
   strip and the panel take the frame's ordinary band gap now, because a line
   strip has no feet to hide.

   OVERRIDE 15 WAS REVERSED ON 2026-08-23. READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING A FILL.

   Ruling K1 pinned this panel to `--card`, the off-beige paper. The client's
   own reference pages reverse it, in three independent places:

     · 26.04, verbatim: "The page itself is off-beige and every panel on it is
       soft paper: never the other way round."
     · the active folder tab's fill was `#F7F2EB`, and CH14's rule is that the
       active tab takes the panel's own fill — so the panel is soft paper.
       (The folder tab is retired; the reading it produced still stands, and
       the breadcrumb strip's live tab makes the same argument today.)
     · the client's own screenshots of both doors.

   A design-lead flip was made on their instruction to match the kit exactly.
   The nesting the whole system now alternates on is `SHELL.md`'s four levels:

       off-beige PAGE  →  soft-paper SCREEN CARD  →  off-beige BODY PANE
         →  soft-paper PANEL (this file)  →  off-beige CARDS

   Two things keep the panel readable, and both are load-bearing. (There were
   three; the first was the rebinding that made the folder tab's fill and this
   panel's fill one colour, and it went with the folder tab on 2026-09-02.)
     · The panel's ground is the BODY PANE, off-beige — the frame's own fill
       at `tone="page"`, which is now the default. In light the panel is
       #F7F2EB and the ground is #FFFEF9; without that ground the panel would
       be invisible and there would be nothing for an inactive tab to be
       clipped against. (Before the reversal these two were the other way
       round, which is what `ScreenShell`'s missing body pane was hiding.)
     · Nothing is separated by a stroke. There is no `border` here, and no
       hairline either: the panel is told apart from its ground by colour, as
       CH13's subtitle demands ("Colour separates, strokes don't").

   The panel keeps chapter 24.3's middle z-index, 2. The 1 and the 3 around it
   were the inactive and active folder tabs' and are gone from this file; the
   breadcrumb strip keeps all three.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   Kit "Assembled screens → List / collection page", read out of
   `Design Mothership/kit-current/Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html`. Its own paragraph is
   the whole brief, verbatim:

       "Every collection screen shares this anatomy: eyebrow + title, optional
        figure strip, tabs, then one shared toolbar (search, filters, view
        switch, actions) above a swappable body. Only the body changes between
        a list, a board, a calendar, and so on."

   and the dev note under it, also verbatim, is the law this file enforces:

       "Toolbar order never changes: search, then filters, then view switcher,
        then actions pinned right. … The 4th+ action collapses under a '···'
        icon button rather than adding more pills."

   OVERRIDE 28 (2026-08-23) — THE CONTRACT CAN GROW A SLOT, AND THIS IS THE
   PRECEDENT. SAY IT OUT LOUD, BECAUSE IT IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE RULING.

   CH27.26 draws a period stepper — `‹ 6 weeks ›` — INSIDE this toolbar,
   between the search field and the view switch. The contract above fixes the
   slots and adds "only the body below the toolbar changes", and GAPS-TRACK2A
   calls this "the one place the seven views touch the toolbar contract at
   all". The client ruled for CH27.26's placement, so the stepper is in the
   toolbar and THE CONTRACT GREW A FIFTH SLOT to hold it. What that settles,
   and what a future reader must not un-settle by "correcting" this file back:

       The toolbar's ORDER is still absolute and still the component's, not
       the call site's. What is no longer closed is the LIST. A slot may be
       ADDED when a chapter draws a control in this toolbar that none of the
       existing slots describes — and it is added HERE, as its own named prop
       in a fixed position, never by letting a call site smuggle a control
       into `filters` and hope. Before this ruling, the artifact's own
       placement was only reachable by exactly that smuggling.

       A slot is still a PLACEMENT AND NOT A DRAWING. `period` renders the
       node it is handed and styles nothing, the way `band` does. The stepper
       itself is drawn by `gantt.tsx`, which is where CH27.26 is transcribed.

   The order is now: search → filters → PERIOD → view switch → actions.

   THE PRECEDENT WAS USED A SECOND TIME ON 2026-09-02, and this is the note
   that says so rather than leaving a reader to wonder whether `toolbarPanel`
   was smuggled in. The slot that grew is not inside the toolbar row — it is
   BETWEEN the toolbar and the rows. CH27.1's sentence fixes the REGIONS
   ("toolbar, rows, pager inside it"), and the client's ruling of the same day
   ("the expanded toolbar shoudl not be an overlay, but literaly expand the
   space") requires a place in flow for what a toolbar control opens. There
   was none, so hosts were portalling into the panel's body. One named slot,
   in one fixed position, drawn only when passed — the same three conditions
   override 28 set. The region order inside the panel is now:

       band → toolbar → TOOLBAR PANEL → rows → pager

   and, as before, the ORDER is the component's and the DRAWING is not.

   The same toolbar is drawn again in kit chapter 19 ("Collection views · 24
   view types · one toolbar contract"), where the hairline rule between the
   toolbar groups is a 1-wide, 22-tall bar at 14% ink — drawn as
   `Separator orientation="vertical"`, which is the same rule at `--border`,
   and drawn by `ToolbarRow` since the row moved there.

   The two registers are the kit's own:
     · `kwapso-ui.css` → `.kw-empty` — the in-place register: centred column,
       gap 8, inset 48/24, tertiary ink, body-s, centred text.
     · `kwapso-patterns.css` → `.kw-register` — the block register: panel
       fill, box radius, inset 32, eyebrow / title / body / action row.
   Chapter 21's subtitle is the rule they both obey: "Say what happened, then
   the one next step."

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · The frame's ground is `--background`, not `--surface-panel` — the K1
     reversal, and the opposite of what this line said until 2026-08-23. The
     frame does not hold cards directly: it holds ONE PANEL, and that panel is
     soft paper, so the ground under it has to be the other tone or the panel
     is invisible. PATTERN §11's rule — a card's ground is the panel tone — is
     unchanged and now applies one level further in, INSIDE the panel, which
     is where the cards actually are.
   · A band states which paper tone it is, and the secondary-button and pill
     fills re-resolve inside it — kwapso-ui.css's `.kw-on-panel` /
     `.kw-on-page`, the provisional GAP-10 mechanism. Carried here as two
     custom properties set on the root, so a `Button variant="secondary"`
     inside the frame is never the same tone as the frame. THE PANEL SETS THEM
     AGAIN, because a control in the toolbar stands on the panel and not on
     the frame: ruling 01 is relational — "a filled paper button in the other
     tone, so a band and its buttons are never the same tone" — and CH27.1
     draws that same opposition on this very toolbar ("both keeping their
     round off-beige well, which is what makes them read as buttons on a
     soft-paper toolbar").
   · The toolbar order is fixed by the component, not by the call site. That
     is the entire reason the search, filter and view-switch slots are three
     separate props instead of one `toolbar` node. Since 2026-09-08 the
     component that fixes it is `ToolbarRow`, which this frame renders and
     which is reachable on its own — the slots and their order are unchanged
     and are now stated in one file rather than welded into this one. Read
     `components/toolbar-row/toolbar-row.tsx` for the whole argument,
     including why it does not have a sixth `sort` slot and does not hide
     itself over an empty collection.
   · An unqualified `<Badge>` is quiet. The record count is a quiet chip;
     mango is opt-in and one per view.
   · Blocks are separated by colour, not by strokes. The one hairline here is
     `Title`'s own section rule, which is same-tone separation.
   · Focus is one global rule (tokens.css §8). Nothing here draws a ring.
   · Every user-facing string is a prop with a default, including the two the
     screen reader hears and the eye never does.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   No `"use client"`. This module holds no state, calls no hook and creates no
   handler during its own render — it forwards nodes and props. `Tabs` is
   itself a client component and carries its own directive, as does the
   `DropdownMenu` inside `ToolbarRow`; a server component may render them
   unchanged.

   THE COLLECTION PANEL — ruling J2.

   CH27.1: "toolbar, rows, pager inside it". One surface, not three bands.

   · `bg-surface-panel` — soft paper, the K1 reversal. CH27.1 and CH14 both
     argue it from the active folder tab's own fill, which this frame no longer
     draws; the fill they argued FOR is unchanged, and the breadcrumb strip's
     live tab now makes the same argument against the screen card.
   · `rounded-[var(--radius)]` — ruling 03: 24, the one box radius.
   · `relative z-[2]` — chapter 24.3's middle number. It used to sit between an
     inactive folder tab (1) and an active one (3); with the folder tab retired
     there is nothing above or below it here, and it is kept because the panel
     is still the frame's own painted layer and a caller may drop positioned
     content on either side of it.
   · The secondary and pill fills re-resolve AGAIN here, because a control in
     the toolbar stands on `--card` and not on the frame's ground. Ruling 01
     is relational, and CH27.1 draws the opposition on this exact toolbar.
   · No `border`, no hairline, no shadow. Colour is the separation (CH13), and
     neither CH27.1 nor CH14 draws a rule or a lift on this panel — CH14's own
     folder PANEL (`FolderPanel`, which is not retired) is a plain fill at 24.
     GAPS-J2 J2-4.
   · No `overflow: hidden`. A clipped panel would shave the global focus ring
     off the first control in the toolbar and off the first and last row.

   * not grow the pill it came out of. This frame owns every line of markup

   * nowhere in flow for such a panel to land: the consuming app wrapped the
   * whole frame in a context provider, published a DOM node as the first
   * child of the body, and `createPortal`'d the panel into it — roughly 90
   * lines of app code, all of it to reach a position this component could
   * simply offer. It offers it.
   *
   * A PLACEMENT, NOT A DRAWING, exactly as `band` and `period` are: the frame
   * decides only WHERE the node sits and gives it the panel's own column gap.
   * Nothing here styles it, sizes it, or animates it — the control that owns
   * the panel owns its skin, and a panel that wants to be an overlay should
   * not be passed here at all.
   *
   * NOT `band`, and the two are not interchangeable. `band` is CH27.5's one

   * permanently. This is what a toolbar control opened, below the toolbar,
   * transiently. A composition may have both.

 * The shell every collection sits in.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — heading band, optional figures, optional tabs, then
 *                      ONE panel holding the optional standing band, the
 *                      toolbar, whatever a toolbar control has opened, the
 *                      rows and the pager (CH27.1, ruling J2, and the second
 *                      use of override 28's precedent). The active tab is
 *                      attached to that panel's top edge; nothing else is a
 *                      band.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply to the frame. It is a band; the rows,
 *                      cards and controls inside it carry their own, and a
 *                      whole reacting panel would be noise.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      at the control's own radius. NEITHER the frame NOR the
 *                      panel sets `overflow: hidden`, so a ring on the first
 *                      tab, on the search field or on the first row is never
 *                      shaved off at a corner.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply. The press belongs to the tab or the
 *                      button, both of which already nudge.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply to the frame; per tab via
 *                      `tabs[].disabled`, as a fill and an ink. A whole
 *                      collection that is unavailable is a screen the
 *                      composition should not have rendered.
 *  6. loading        — `loading`: the CHROME STAYS and only the body is
 *                      replaced, by the busy register. Swapping the heading
 *                      and the tabs for placeholders moves the controls the
 *                      reader is already aiming at, and the counts they read
 *                      a moment ago.
 *  7. empty          — `empty`: the `.kw-empty` register, centred and quiet.
 *                      Note the kit's own warning next to that class —
 *                      hide-when-empty is a real pattern elsewhere and must
 *                      not be "fixed" into this; a frame that should vanish
 *                      is not mounted by the composition in the first place.
 *  8. error          — `error`: the same register with a poppy dot and its
 *                      own wording. Chapter 21: say what happened, then the
 *                      one next step — which is why the register takes
 *                      `actions` and the default is a single control.
 *  9. selected       — the selected TAB, owned by Radix via `value` /
 *                      `defaultValue` and drawn by the strip's indicator. The
 *                      frame itself is never selected.
 * 10. read-only      — the frame holds no value of its own. A read-only
 *                      collection passes read-only controls into the slots.
 *
 *  Precedence, resolved in JS rather than stacked as classes: loading beats
 *  error beats empty. A request still in flight has not failed yet, and a
 *  request that failed has not come back empty — it has not come back.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  THE TOOLBAR IS ONE ROW AT ALL THREE — client, 2026-09-04, and the only
 *  part of this section that is not width-dependent. It is one flex row that
 *  never wraps, made of a scrolling lane (search, filters, period, view
 *  switch) and the action group pinned outside it. Its height is one
 *  control's height at 380, at 834 and at 1440; where the slots need more
 *  width than the panel has, the LANE scrolls and the page does not. The full
 *  reasoning, and the three shapes that were tried and rejected, are on the
 *  row itself.
 *  · mobile (base) — one column throughout. The heading row wraps, so the
 *    header actions drop under the heading rather than squeezing it. In the
 *    toolbar the search field is the elastic slot, floored at `--space-11` so
 *    it cannot be squeezed out of existence, and the rest of the lane is
 *    reached by swiping it. The vertical rules between the toolbar groups are
 *    hidden, because a rule between two groups the reader scrolls past one at
 *    a time is just a mark, and because 39px of rule and gap is a quarter of
 *    the width a 380 phone gives this toolbar. The period stepper's own words
 *    never wrap (`whitespace-nowrap` on the label), so it stays one readable
 *    control at 380 rather than breaking across two lines. Frame inset 24,
 *    panel inset 24 — CH27.1 is explicit that narrow keeps the toolbar and the
 *    panel ("the toolbar is never dropped — it condenses"), so nothing about
 *    the J2 attachment is width-dependent.
 *  · tablet (`sm:`, 40rem) — the rules between the toolbar groups reappear.
 *    This is the width the kit's own toolbar drawing fits at. Frame inset 24,
 *    panel inset 24.
 *  · desktop (`lg:`, 64rem) — unchanged in structure; the frame inset and the
 *    panel inset both step to 32, matching `Card`'s inset response so a frame
 *    and a card inside it stay in register. The tab strip never wraps at any
 *    width; it scrolls, which is `TabsList`'s own stated behaviour — and the
 *    panel it is attached to does not scroll with it, so a strip scrolled to
 *    its end still meets the same edge.
 *
 * RTL — safe, and unused: the system is LTR only. Every inset is logical
 * (`px-*` is padding-inline), the action group is pushed with `ms-auto`
 * rather than a physical margin, and nothing here names a side.

            `--folder-tab-overlap` and any gap at all left a stripe of ground

            live.

            THE STACK NO LONGER SPENDS A `gap` OF ITS OWN — CHANGED 2026-09-03,
            SAME DAY AS THE NUMBER ITSELF. It used to keep "the frame's
            ordinary band gap at every density" here, a flex `gap` between
            this `<Tabs>` wrapper and the panel below. The client then asked
            for that space to survive scrolling — a strip that pins at the top
            of a scrolling pane keeps its own box, including any padding, but
            a flex `gap` is a static distance between two siblings and stops
            meaning anything the moment one of them goes sticky. So the space
            moved onto the STRIP's own box: `TABS_STRIP_GAP` is
            `tabs.tsx`'s exported padding-block-end, on the `<Tabs>` wrapper
            immediately below (whose only child is `TabsList`, so this is
            "padding right after the strip" with nothing else inside that
            box to disturb). This stack is a plain column now; the density
            variants above still govern the frame's OWN inset and its OTHER
            gaps (header to figures, figures to this stack), which this join
            was never about. */}

              /* THE THREE PAPERS THAT USED TO BE RESOLVED HERE ARE GONE WITH
                 THE FOLDER VARIANT (client ruling, 2026-09-02), AND SO IS THE
                 WHOLE OVERRIDE 30 / 38 / 39 ARGUMENT THIS BLOCK CARRIED.

                 What stood here: `--card: var(--surface-panel)` on `Tabs` and
                 `--surface-panel: var(--muted)` on `TabsList`, two rebindings
                 that moved the folder shape's active and inactive fills
                 without editing `tabs.tsx`, plus a `rounded-t-[var(--radius)]
                 bg-surface-page` band for the strip to stand on. A `line`
                 strip is a rule under a heading, not a shape standing on a
                 ground: it has no fill to move, no band to stand on and no
                 corner to round. All four classes are removed rather than
                 left inert — an inert rebinding is exactly the kind of thing
                 the next reader "fixes".

                 The measured figures they produced are not lost. The register
                 keeps them, and the surviving folder shape — the breadcrumb
                 strip — restates its own pair and measures them again in
                 `verify/breadcrumb-folder/`. */

                        every tab, which is a filled chip inside a tab shape —
                        two boxes deep, and the one thing CH14 ruled out by
                        name. The quiet number this override fixed it to is now
                        `TabsCount` itself (GAPS-RULINGS.md R-4a), so this

                lines of measured argument that used to sit here moved with it
                rather than being summarised away. Read
                `components/toolbar-row/toolbar-row.tsx`: the one-row rebuild
                of 2026-09-04, the scrolling lane and why it is `relative`, the
                elastic search slot's floor, the chip slot as the row's shock
                absorber, the `sm:` group rules, and the pinned action group
                with its `···` overflow are all there, unchanged, with their
                measurements.

                WHY IT LEFT THIS FILE. The contract was reachable only by
                adopting this whole frame — its heading, count chip, figure
                strip, tab strip, one soft-paper panel, three registers, body
                and pager. A screen whose body is a month grid or a chart
                cannot do that for a search box and a `+`, so it writes a bare
                `<div className="flex justify-end">` instead; the consuming app
                wrote that four times, then wrote a private toolbar of its own,
                which then could not receive this row's later rulings and still
                wraps to a second line at the widths the 2026-09-04 change was
                made to fix. Extracting costs this file nothing — the same
                markup, from one module instead of two — and it is what makes
                that a bug somebody can fix rather than a component somebody
                has to rewrite.

                NOTHING HERE CHANGES SHAPE. The row is `ground="bare"` because
                this frame's own panel already paints the soft paper it stands
                on and already spends `gap-5` under it, which is the same
                number the standalone row pays as its own trailing margin. The
                panel a toolbar control opens stays THIS file's `toolbarPanel`,
                a sibling below, for the same reason: there is already a place
                in flow here, and routing it through the row would nest it a
                box deeper for nothing. `data-slot` is passed through so the
                element keeps the name every probe has always known it by. */}
