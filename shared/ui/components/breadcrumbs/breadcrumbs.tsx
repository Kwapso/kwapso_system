/* ============================================================================
   Breadcrumbs — the whole trail from one array (2 direct call sites).

   THE SECOND CALL SITE IS `breadcrumb-folders.tsx`, ONE FILE AWAY, SINCE
   2026-09-04, and it is the reason this file's plain drawing now ships on
   every screen the folder strip does. The client, on the live product: "in
   monile, lets use normal breadcrumbs (like they ware before, jhust teh
   text)". Below the shell's own `md` breakpoint the strip is `display: none`
   and THIS component is the trail — same items, same landmark name, wrapping
   the way `BreadcrumbList` already argues a narrow trail should. Nothing about
   this file changed to accommodate it except one attribute that was wrong
   either way; see the `aria-current` block in the render.

   WHAT THAT MEANS FOR ANY CHANGE MADE HERE. This is no longer one drawing
   beside another — it is the PHONE'S drawing of the trail the strip draws on a
   desktop, from the identical array. A crumb that reads differently here
   than it does there is now a difference a single user can hear by rotating
   a tablet, so the two must be kept in step; where they already disagreed,
   they were reconciled rather than left.

   WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE `breadcrumb/`
   Commission §6 lists both, as two separate folders with two separate exports,
   so both are built. They are not duplicates and neither wraps the other's
   job:
     · `breadcrumb/` is the COMPOSABLE form — seven parts a call site
       assembles, which is what a route that needs a dropdown inside one crumb
       or a Next `<Link>` on another has to have.
     · `Breadcrumbs` (this file) is the ONE-PROP form: an array in, the finished
       trail out, including the separators, the current-page crumb and the
       elision of a deep trail. It is what the single existing call site wants
       and what a screen recipe can be handed by `ScreenRenderer`.
   Everything visual is `breadcrumb/`'s. This file decides no colour, no size
   and no spacing — it only decides STRUCTURE, so the two can never drift.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   Structure only, and it is a derivation rather than a drawing: the kit draws
   no trail. Logged as GAPS-D BCR-1. The appearance is entirely
   `breadcrumb/breadcrumb.tsx`, which names its own kit sources.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · Every user-facing string is a prop with a default — the landmark's name
     and the ellipsis's announced label. Arabic, Urdu, Persian.
   · The last item is never a link. It is the page.
   · Empty renders nothing. A trail of zero steps is not a trail, and the kit's
     rule throughout is to render nothing rather than fill a hole.
   · No colour, size, radius or spacing is decided here; see above.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   No `"use client"`. A pure mapping over props, rendering parts that are
   themselves server-safe.

 *  1. default        — root … page, separators between.
 *  2. hover          — per crumb; `BreadcrumbLink` owns it.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply; a trail link occupies no box.
 *  5. disabled       — an item with no `href` renders as the non-link crumb,
 *                      which is the trail's disabled form and announces itself
 *                      as one. There is no greyed-out link.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply. A trail is known before the page it
 *                      describes; a skeleton crumb would be a placeholder for
 *                      something already in hand.
 *  7. empty          — `items: []` renders `null`. Not an empty `<nav>`, not a
 *                      lone chevron, not a dash.
 *  8. error          — does not apply. A trail reports nothing.
 *  9. selected       — exactly one crumb: `BreadcrumbPage`, primary ink plus
 *                      `aria-current="page"`. The LAST one unless
 *                      `activeIndex` names another, and none at all when that
 *                      index falls outside the array.
 * 10. read-only      — always.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED, and deliberately so: the trail wraps
 *  at every width (`BreadcrumbList`) and the shortening lever is `maxItems`, a
 *  CONTENT decision the call site makes, not a width the component guesses at.
 *  A composition that wants a two-crumb trail on a phone passes
 *  `maxItems={2}` from its own media query, so the decision stays somewhere a
 *  translator and a designer can both see it.
 *
 * RTL — safe. Every part is, and the order of the array is the reading order
 * in both directions.

                       SPLIT OUT OF THE BRANCH ABOVE ON 2026-09-04. The two
                       cases shared one arm and therefore one attribute:
                       `BreadcrumbPage` sets `aria-current="page"`
                       unconditionally (it is the element FOR the page you are
                       on), so a middle crumb that merely had no `href`
                       announced itself as the current location too, and a
                       trail like `Clients / Halloway / Q3` with an unrouted
                       middle published TWO current pages. There is exactly one
                       location a reader is at, and `aria-current` is how it is
                       heard when the ink cannot be seen.

                       THE FIX IS NOT NEW HERE — IT IS THE SECOND DRAWING'S,
                       BROUGHT BACK. `breadcrumb-folders.tsx` in this same
                       folder hit it first and wrote the ruling down at its own
                       rest tab: such a crumb "takes the page element for its
                       semantics and the REST fill for its drawing, and
                       `aria-current` is dropped: there is exactly one current
                       location and it is the last tab." The two forms of one
                       trail must not disagree about that, and since 2026-09-04
                       they cannot be heard apart: below `md` the folder strip
                       renders THIS component, so a divergence here would have
                       been a phone announcing a different current page than
                       the desktop did from the same array.

                       The DRAWING is untouched — still the non-link crumb, a
                       step you can see and not visit, which is TEN STATES #5
                       above and remains true word for word. */
