/* ============================================================================
   ScreenRenderer — a whole screen drawn from a declarative recipe
   (17 direct call sites, the most-called collection in the system).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" → chapter 19 "Collection views" and chapter 27
   "Compositions". Three quotes carry the whole design and each is verbatim:

     ch19, the chapter's own contract line:
       "Every view carries the same contract: search, filters, three actions,
        view switch. Only the body below the toolbar changes."

     ch27 · Law 1 · One spine:
       "Rail, then header band, then one body column. 208px rail of soft
        paper, a header that carries eyebrow, title and actions, a body of
        cards on off-beige. No screen invents a second spine — no page-level
        split panes, no floating action bars."

     ch27 · Law 4 · A state is a body swap:
       "Loading, empty and archived are the same composition with the body
        replaced; adding, editing and denial are the same composition with a
        layer over it. Either way the rail, header and tabs stay drawn and
        stay put. Only a whole-page failure is allowed to replace the frame."

   ch27.1, the screen every other screen is measured against, states the
   region ORDER outright: "Figures → tabs → toolbar → rows → pager".

   Chapter 21's registers (`.kw-register` in
   design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-patterns.css) and `.kw-empty` in
   kwapso-ui.css are what a swapped body is swapped FOR, and they are drawn
   here as `ScreenRegister`.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · ONE SPINE. There is no `aside`, no split pane and no second column at
     any width. Law 1 forbids it in those words, so the recipe has no way to
     express one and a call site cannot accidentally build one.
   · A STATE IS A BODY SWAP. `state` replaces `body` and NOTHING else: the
     header band, the hero, the tab strip, the toolbar and the footer all
     stay drawn and stay put. `fatal` is the single exception the law names
     (ch27.19, a signed-out session) and it is opt-in.
   · A BLOCK THE READER MAY NOT SEE RENDERS NOTHING. `visible: false` is not
     a placeholder, not a lock, not a dimmed panel — the block is absent.
     ch24.6: "Permissions HIDE actions rather than disabling them, so a
     client never sees a button they can't press."
   · THE HEADER BAND IS TRANSPARENT (ch24.6, verbatim: "The header band is
     transparent — it takes the page tone"). It paints no fill of its own.
     The BODY ground is `--surface-panel`, because it holds cards and
     PATTERN §11 rules that a card's ground is the panel tone.
   · Only four radii, no px, no hex, no font size. Every gap above 32 is a
     `--space-*` token.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). Nothing here rings anything.

   THE RECIPE, AND WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY
   The commission's test is that "an engineer drops yours in and changes no
   application code", and section 11's test is that a new screen can be built
   "without asking a designer". Both point the same way: a screen must be
   describable as DATA. So:

     · Every slot that holds a COMPONENT is `ScreenBlock[]` — one uniform
       shape, `{ kind, id?, span?, visible?, props? }`.
     · Every slot that holds TEXT is a `ReactNode` — a title is a string, not
       a component, and wrapping it in a block would be ceremony.
     · `kind` is resolved through a REGISTRY, not through a switch in this
       file. That is the load-bearing decision. A switch would force this
       file to import all 26 collections, which (a) makes the most-imported
       file in the system depend on every other one, (b) breaks the moment a
       collection is added, and (c) means an application cannot add a block
       type of its own without editing library code — the exact failure
       commission §0 names. The registry is merged down the tree, so an app
       registers once at the root and every nested `ScreenRenderer` sees it.
     · `node` is a built-in kind whose `props.children` is any ReactNode. It
       is the escape hatch, so a recipe is never a cage: anything the
       registry does not know can still be dropped in, in one line.
     · An unknown `kind` renders NOTHING and warns in development. A screen
       with one mis-typed block must not become a blank page or a crash.

   THE THREE DOORS ARE ONE COMPONENT
   Commission §9 describes two doors: one dense, wide and used all day by
   staff, the other narrow, calm and larger-typed for occasional readers.
   ch27's own heading for the pair is "Two doors, one grammar". That is
   `density`, and it is the only knob: `comfortable` is the wide door at full
   width, `calm` centres a narrower column and opens the gaps one step.
   Nothing else in the drawing differs, which is what stops the two products
   reading as one screen with a different logo while keeping them one family.
   The `calm` measure is a chosen number — GAPS-COL3 SCR-2.

   marks but the specimen set never transcribed them". Re-checked against the
   artifact TEMPLATE, which carries every inline style: that premise is
   false. Chapter 21 draws four registers and not one holds an icon — they
   hold a micro uppercase eyebrow, and the failure one puts a 7px poppy DOT
   in front of it. 27.21 and 27.22, the two in-body registers this component
   actually is, draw no eyebrow and no mark either: a 22/500 line, a 14.5
   paragraph, the action row, and nothing above them. And the ONLY
   `width="32" height="32"` icon in the whole artifact is chapter 04's
   icon-size ladder specimen.

   So the three marks were invented, and they are gone. `mark` stays a prop
   with its documented `null` / node contract, so a caller that wants one
   still passes one; what changes is that the kit no longer draws a picture
   the artifact never drew.

   THE EYEBROW HALF, CLOSED 2026-09-02. This paragraph used to end "The
   EYEBROW half of CH21's register is still missing here and needs a new
   prop, so it is logged, not smuggled in" — and that gap is exactly what the
   client meant, verbatim, weeks later and about a different symptom: "but i
   gave you a specific design inside a card, you took it only partially."
   27 call sites in the other repo were moved onto `ShapeStateBody` (which
   renders THIS component) for their load-failure state, and every one of
   them lost the eyebrow her reference card showed next to a small red dot —
   because this component never drew one. `form.tsx` had already drawn it
   correctly, transcribed straight off chapter 21, in a LOCAL `Register` of
   its own (`.t21-dot`, `--dot-status`, poppy, leading the micro uppercase
   words); it simply never reached this shared one. `eyebrow` above is that
   same recipe, moved here so the two components stop disagreeing about one
   chapter. The dot is scoped to `tone="error"` — ch21 draws it on the
   FAILURE register only; the other three carry an eyebrow with no dot. */

 * Chapter 21's register, and the body a state swap swaps in.

 * `.kw-register` is a `--surface-panel` box at radius 24 with a 32 inset;

 * tertiary ink, centred text. Both are drawn: the box is the panel the body
 * grid already provides, so this component draws the COLUMN and lets the

 *
 * The loading register draws SKELETON LINES, never a spinner. ch24.4:

 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — the centred column: mark, title, description, action.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply. A register is a statement, not a
 *                      target. Its `action` is a Button and hovers itself.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. A register cannot be switched off; a
 *                      screen that has nothing to say does not render one.
 *  6. loading        — `tone="loading"`: skeleton lines, `aria-busy`.
 *  7. empty          — `tone="empty"`: the inbox mark and the caller's words.
 *                      A register with no title, no description and no
 *                      action renders `null` — nothing invented to fill a
 *                      hole, which is the system's rule everywhere.
 *  8. error          — `tone="error"`: the warning mark. Poppy is NOT used
 *                      for the mark: poppy means blocked, and a failed fetch
 *                      is not a blocked record. Nor is `--warning`, which
 *                      stopped being the quiet chip on 2026-09-02 and is now
 *                      the client's orange — a register is a statement, not
 *                      a chip, and this column carries no fill at all. The
 *                      mark takes tertiary ink with the rest of the column.
 *                      GAPS-COL3 SCR-4.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply.
 * 10. read-only      — always.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED. A centred column at 40ch already
 *  fits 320 and does not grow past its measure on a wide screen, which is
 *  the whole reason the kit gives it a measure rather than a width.
 *
 * RTL — safe. `text-center` has no direction and every inset is logical.

/**
 * A whole screen, from data.

 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — `state="ready"`: header band, hero, tab strip,
 *                      toolbar, the body's blocks, footer.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply to the frame. Every hover on a screen
 *                      belongs to a control or a row inside it, and each of
 *                      those carries its own named token. A frame that
 *                      responded to the pointer would light up on every
 *                      mouse move.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *                      Nothing in this file sets `overflow: hidden`, so a
 *                      ring inside the body is never shaved; the ONE
 *                      scrolling box is the tab strip, and `TabsList` already
 *                      carries the scroll padding that keeps its ring whole.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply, for the same reason as hover.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply to a screen. A screen a reader may not
 *                      open is not disabled, it is not rendered: ch24.6 says
 *                      permissions HIDE. A single block hides with
 *                      `visible: false`, and a whole screen is the router's
 *                      decision, not this component's.
 *  6. loading        — `state="loading"`: LAW 4. The body is replaced with
 *                      skeleton lines and everything else stays exactly where
 *                      it was, so the page is never seen to be built twice
 *                      (ch27.6: "the destination screen with its body
 *                      unfilled").
 *  7. empty          — `state="empty"`: the body is replaced with chapter
 *                      21's register. The frame stays (ch27.21). A screen
 *                      whose `body` array is empty resolves to this by
 *                      itself, so a recipe cannot render a hole by accident.
 *  8. error          — `state="error"`: the register in its error tone,
 *                      `role="alert"`. `fatal` is the one case that replaces
 *                      the frame instead (ch27.19), and it is opt-in.
 *  9. selected       — the selected TAB, owned by `Tabs`. A screen itself is
 *                      never selected.
 * 10. read-only      — always. A screen holds no value; the fields inside it
 *                      do, and each carries its own read-only skin.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile  — one body column. The header band wraps its actions under the
 *            heading (`Title` does this itself). The toolbar wraps. The tab
 *            strip SCROLLS on the inline axis rather than wrapping —
 *            `TabsList`'s own answer, and the right one here because a
 *            two-line strip stops reading as one row of peers.
 *  tablet  — two body columns from `md:` (48rem), so a pair of half-width
 *            panels sits side by side. Everything else is unchanged.
 *  desktop — six body columns from `lg:` (64rem), which is what lets thirds
 *            and halves share a row. In `density="calm"` the whole shell is
 *            centred at 60rem instead of filling the width, which is the
 *            only geometric difference between the two doors.
 *  At no width does a second spine appear — law 1 — and at no width does a
 *  region move to another region. What changes is column count and wrapping.
 *
 * RTL — safe. Every inset is logical, the grid mirrors on its own, the
 * header band's actions are pushed by `Title`'s `ms-auto`, and the tab
 * strip's indicator is measured against the computed direction inside
 * `Tabs`. Nothing in this file names an inline side.

              CLIENT RULING, 2026-09-02: "the only tabs that we will have are
              the line tabs because folders will only be used for the
              breadcrumbs." This file used to state `variant="folder"` here,
              under ruling E of 2026-08-22 ("folder tabs are for main screens,
              line tabs for detail screens"), because `ScreenRenderer` draws
              ch19 COLLECTION VIEWS ONLY and has no record/detail mode at all.
              With one tab shape left there is nothing to state and no
              regression to close by stating it; the whole argument for saying
              it out loud went with the second variant. */}

                 AROUND `TabsList` BELOW — CHANGED 2026-09-03, TWICE. First
                 from this file's own `gap-[var(--space-3h)]` (14) to the
                 shared `tabs.tsx` constant (20, `--space-5`), on the client's
                 "change the rule and apply it everywhere"; then OFF this
                 root's flex `gap` entirely and onto a wrapper as padding, so
                 the gap survives a strip that pins on scroll — a `gap`
                 between siblings stops meaning anything once one of them goes
                 sticky, padding on the pinned box does not. `gap-0` cancels
                 `Tabs`'s own base `gap-4` — otherwise the base survives
                 untouched and the strip carries both the wrapper's 20px
                 padding and the root's 16px flex gap. */
