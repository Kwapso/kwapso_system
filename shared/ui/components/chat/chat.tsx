/* ============================================================================
   Chat — the message thread: both sides, composer, attachments
   (0 direct call sites; the shape 3 other collections are drawn from).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   `design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-patterns.css` → `.kw-thread`, `.kw-msg`,
   `.kw-msg__bubble`, `.kw-msg--theirs`, `.kw-msg--mine`, `.kw-msg__receipt`,
   `.kw-comment__avatar`, `.kw-composer`, `.kw-composer__ghost`,
   `.kw-composer__send`; plus `_fragments/t22.css` →
   `.kw-msg__bubble--media` and `.kw-msg__media`, and the decisions in
   `_fragments/t22-gaps.md` (T22-1, T22-3, T22-5).

   The controlling text is RULING 36, quoted in full because it settles the
   whole component and supersedes the drawn chapter 22 specimen:

       "The 'no alternating sides' sentence described something the kit never
        drew. Threads are yours-right on the charcoal fill, theirs-left on
        paper, avatars outside, 62% maximum width. The ban stands on tails,
        scrims and gradients only."

   The kit's own appendix rule settles which wins: "Where a ruling contradicts
   an older page, the ruling wins." The drawn chapter 22 specimen (mango-right
   / card-left at 78% with no avatars) is therefore NOT built. Recorded again
   in GAPS-COL1 CH-1 so nobody re-opens it.

   Figures kept verbatim:
     · thread    — column, gap 10 (`--space-2h`)
     · message   — flex, gap 8, `align-items: flex-end`, `max-width: 62%`
     · bubble    — box radius, inset 12/16, caption at `--leading-normal`
     · mine      — `--surface-inverse` fill, `--ink-on-inverse` ink, reversed
     · theirs    — `--surface-raised` fill
     · receipt   — micro, `--ink-disabled`, tabular, inline-end inset 6
     · media     — bubble inset steps to 6, block 13rem at 4/3, radius stepped
                   in by the same 6 so the corners stay concentric
     · composer  — `--surface-raised`, pill, inset 8 with 16 at the inline
                   start; send is `--surface-inverse` at the dense height

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · Ruling 36, above: sides, fills, avatars outside, 62%. No tails, no
     scrims, no gradients — and none is drawn here.
   · A pill is a person at 24 / 32 / 48 with `flex: none` (ruling 30). The
     thread's mark is 24, `Avatar size="sm"`, outside the bubble.
   · White type on an accent is a rejection. The charcoal bubble carries
     `--ink-on-inverse`, which is off-beige on charcoal in light and charcoal
     on off-beige in dark — a token flip, not a second drawing.
   · Focus is one global rule (tokens.css §8). The composer field, the send
     control and any attachment link are all real controls and take it.
   · Every user-facing string is a prop with a default, including the two the
     screen reader hears and the eye never does.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"` — the composer holds a submit handler and a key handler
   created during this module's own render.

/**
 * A message thread.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — a column of bubbles, yours right on charcoal, theirs
 *                      left on paper, marks outside, capped at 62%.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply to a bubble. A message is not a target;
 *                      the kit draws no hovered bubble and a thread whose
 *                      every line lit up would twinkle as you read it. An
 *                      attachment LINK hovers, as a link does: its underline
 *                      moves to the current ink. Logged as GAPS-COL1 CH-4.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      at the control's own radius. The composer field, the
 *                      send control and an attachment link are all real
 *                      controls and are reached by keyboard already.
 *  4. active/pressed — belongs to the send control, which nudges 1 hairline
 *                      like every other Button. A bubble has no press.
 *  5. disabled       — `disabled` on the composer: the field takes the
 *                      disabled skin (`--surface-quiet` / `--ink-disabled`)
 *                      and the send control takes `--btn-disabled-fill` and
 *                      `--btn-disabled-label`. A fill and an ink, never an
 *                      opacity. The THREAD is never disabled — a conversation
 *                      you may not add to is a read-only thread, which is
 *                      `composer={false}`.
 *  6. loading        — two different waits, and they are not the same
 *                      picture. `loading` is the THREAD arriving: skeleton
 *                      rows, cold cache only. `sending` is a message in
 *                      flight: the composer keeps its fill and the send
 *                      control grows a spinner, exactly as `button.tsx`
 *                      draws a submitting control.
 *  7. empty          — no messages: the quiet register, and the composer
 *                      stays mounted. A thread you can start is not the same
 *                      thing as a thread that is missing, and hiding the
 *                      composer would remove the one next step.
 *  8. error          — two, again. `error` is the thread failing to load:
 *                      the register, poppy dot, its own wording. A single
 *                      message failing to send is `message.failed`, which
 *                      puts poppy ink and the words on that message's receipt
 *                      line — the dot never carries the meaning alone
 *                      (ruling 26).
 *  9. selected       — the kit draws no selected message. Not invented;
 *                      logged as GAPS-COL1 CH-5.
 * 10. read-only      — `composer={false}`. The thread renders unchanged; only
 *                      the way in is gone. This is the honest read-only: a
 *                      greyed-out composer implies it might come back.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  · mobile (base) — the 62% cap is RELAXED to 85%. 62% of a 320 viewport is
 *    198 minus the 24 mark and the gap, which is about 22 characters a line;
 *    ruling 36 states 62% as a MAXIMUM and a phone is the width where that
 *    maximum stops being readable. The composer stays a single row and its
 *    send control keeps the 32 dense height, so the whole bar clears a 44
 *    touch row without growing.
 *  · tablet (`sm:`, 40rem) — the drawn state: 62% cap, marks outside.
 *  · desktop — UNCHANGED from tablet. The cap is a percentage, so the thread
 *    keeps its measure as the column grows and never runs a bubble the full
 *    width of a wide screen.
 *
 * RTL — safe, and unused: the system is LTR only. Sides are `self-start` and
 * `self-end` on the inline axis, the reversal is `flex-row-reverse`, and the
 * receipt's inset is `pe-*` (padding-inline-end). Nothing names a side.
