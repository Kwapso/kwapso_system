   Kanban — columns, draggable cards.

   DESIGN SOURCE — AND WHAT IS MISSING
   The SPECIMEN SHEETS draw no board — no `.kw-board`, no `.kw-column`, no
   drag specimen anywhere in `kwapso-ui.css`, `kwapso-patterns.css` or
   `_fragments/` — and the gaps that followed are logged in GAPS-COL2
   (KAN-1 … KAN-4). CHAPTER 27.24 DOES draw the assembled board view, and
   what it states now governs where the sheets were silent: the column head
   is status dot + name in words + quiet count; a card carries "only number,
   title, owner and age" — no status pill; the line under the board and its
   "24 records · 4 stages" summary; and the narrow render is a single stage
   picked in a field, NEVER a horizontal scroller under a thumb. What the
   sheets supply, and what this file is built from without inventing
   anything else:

     the card            `Card` — `.kw-card`, the 24 radius, the `--card` fill
                         on a `--surface-panel` ground (PATTERN §11)
     the column ground   THERE IS NONE. CH19 view 02 draws the head and the
                         cards as siblings straight on the frame's soft
                         paper. This file used to paint one and the reason
                         died with the K1 reversal — see the note on the
                         column below (GAPS-FIDELITY-DE L-17).
     the column measure  `.kw-laws { grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit,
                         minmax(18rem, 1fr)) }` — 18rem is the kit's own
                         smallest stated column minimum, so it is taken rather
                         than a new number chosen. KAN-1.
     the count           NOT a `Badge`. CH19 view 02 draws it as a quiet
                         11 tabular number and CH14 states the rule in words
                         on the identical object — "counts are quiet, never
                         badges" (GAPS-FIDELITY-DE L-18).
     every drag moment   motion/motion.css §15, which is fully specified:
                         `.motion-drag` (pick up on `--duration-lift`, held
                         `--motion-lift-scale`, `--shadow-overlay`),
                         `.motion-drag-settle` (drop on `--duration-settle`),
                         `.motion-drag-placeholder` (the hole it came from),
                         `.motion-drop-target` (`--accent` while over),
                         `.motion-row-move` (the cards shuffling to make room).
     the two registers   `.kw-empty` (kwapso-ui.css) and `.kw-register`
                         (kwapso-patterns.css CH21).

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · EVERY DRAG MOMENT IS motion.css'S, NOT THIS FILE'S. No keyframe, no
     duration and no easing is written here; the four classes are attached and
     the two data attributes they select on are set. motion.css §15 explains
     why the lift is `scale:` and not a `transform` and this file must not
     undo that by putting a transform on a dragging card.
   · A DROP TARGET IS `--accent`, THE NEUTRAL WASH. `.motion-drop-target`
     already sets it. Never `--primary`: mango is a brand fill, never a hover
     and never a status, and a board of mango columns would be unreadable.
   · THE BOARD SCROLLS ON THE INLINE AXIS — FROM 45rem UP. It does not wrap
     columns onto a second line and it does not restack into one list. A
     wrapped board is not a board — the whole point is that the columns are
     peers you read across. BELOW 45rem, 27.24 rules the other way: "a
     single stage picked in a field … never a horizontal scroller under a
     thumb" — one column, chosen in a `Select`.
   · A DRAG MUST HAVE A KEYBOARD DOOR. Commission §5: "every interactive
     element reachable and operable by keyboard". Pointer drag alone would
     make a whole component unusable without a mouse, so a card is focusable
     and moves with the arrow keys while a live region says where it went. No
     kit ruling exists for this; the behaviour is built and logged as KAN-3.
   · A CARD READS CHIPS, THEN TITLE, THEN META — ONE ORDER, NO SWITCH. Ruled
     by the client 2026-09-07 ("in cards put chips above title"), applied
     here and not offered as a prop. The argument is at `BoardCard`.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). A card is focusable and rings
     at its own 24 radius; nothing here sets a ring or an `outline`.
   · Disabled is a fill and an ink. A locked card takes `--btn-disabled-fill`
     / `--btn-disabled-label` and cannot be picked up. No opacity anywhere.
   · Every user-facing string is a prop with a default, including the ones
     only a screen reader hears — which on this component is most of them.
   · No product vocabulary (commission §11). Columns, cards, moves.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. State for the card being carried, handlers made during
   render, and a live region updated from an event.

   THE ERROR REGISTER IS THE SHARED ONE — `CollectionRegister`.

   CH21's `.kw-register` was declared LOCALLY in six files, byte-for-byte the
   same markup in every one of them, and one record could show two different
   copies of it at once (a `detail-view` rendering a `DescriptionList`). The
   values inside all six were corrected in place on 2026-08-23, so nothing
   drew wrongly; six chances to drift is the defect, and this is the follow-up
   GAPS-FIDELITY-DE L-2 wrote out. `variant="block"` IS `.kw-register` — the
   panel tone at the 24 radius, `--space-7` inset, left-aligned per 27.21 —
   and `tone="error"` is the 7px poppy dot CH21 puts on exactly one of its
   four registers.

   `.kw-empty` STAYS LOCAL, and that is not an oversight. It is a different
   kit object: one line of words at the 14 step in tertiary ink, not an
   eyebrow / title / body / action column. `CollectionRegister`'s `inline`
   variant carries `.kw-empty`'s box but not its step or its ink, so folding
   the two together would either shrink this register's words or hand every
   inline register a container ink its title would inherit. Logged rather
   than forced.

 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — columns on `--surface-panel` at the 24 radius, cards
 *                      on `--card` inside them, a quiet count beside each
 *                      column's name.
 *  2. hover          — the card takes `Card interactive`'s `--accent` wash and
 *                      `.motion-hover-lift`'s elevation. A named token and a
 *                      named shadow; never an opacity, never mango. A COLUMN
 *                      does not hover — only the card is a target, and a
 *                      column that lit up under the pointer would compete with
 *                      the drop target below.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once, at
 *                      the control's own radius, which for a card is 24. This
 *                      file sets no `overflow: hidden` on a card and gives the
 *                      column list `scroll-p-1`, so a ring on a card at the
 *                      edge of a scrolled column is brought into view whole.
 *  4. active/pressed — the drag PICK-UP is this component's pressed state, and
 *                      it is motion.css's: `--duration-lift` (90ms) to
 *                      `--motion-lift-scale` and `--shadow-overlay`, held for
 *                      the whole carry. A separate press nudge would be two
 *                      answers to one gesture, which motion.css §15 warns
 *                      against by name.
 *  5. disabled       — `card.disabled`: `--btn-disabled-fill` /
 *                      `--btn-disabled-label`, `aria-disabled`, not draggable,
 *                      out of the tab order for the move keys, and no hover so
 *                      a locked card cannot look movable. `column.locked`
 *                      refuses every drop and never lights up. A fill and an
 *                      ink; no opacity is written anywhere in this file.
 *  6. loading        — `loading`: `Skeleton` cards inside each column with the
 *                      column HEADS KEPT, so the board's shape does not jump
 *                      when the cards land. `aria-busy` on the board, the
 *                      empty registers suppressed, and every drag affordance
 *                      withdrawn — a card cannot be moved to a column whose
 *                      contents are not known.
 *  7. empty          — two kinds. An empty COLUMN gets `.kw-empty` inside it,
 *                      at the kit's full inset, which doubles as the drop
 *                      target for the first card. An empty BOARD — no columns
 *                      at all — gets `.kw-empty` in place of the board.
 *  8. error          — `error`: `.kw-register`, the left-aligned panel card,
 *                      announced as an alert. A move that FAILS is the caller's
 *                      to report: the card returns to where it was (the caller
 *                      simply does not apply the move) and the reason belongs
 *                      in a toast or an `Alert`, not smeared over the card.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply, and this is a real decision. A board is
 *                      not a chooser; the thing you do to a card is MOVE it or
 *                      OPEN it. The kit draws no selected card (GAPS-F CRD-3)
 *                      and none is invented. A card being CARRIED is a
 *                      different thing and has its own drawing — the lift.
 * 10. read-only      — no `onMove`: nothing is draggable, no card takes the
 *                      move keys, and no drop target exists. The board still
 *                      reads completely, which is the point.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile   — 27.24, verbatim: "Below 720px the board becomes a single stage
 *             picked in a field, with the count beside it — never four
 *             columns squeezed to 80px each, and never a horizontal scroller
 *             under a thumb." One `Select` over one full-width column; the
 *             field replaces that column's own head. This REPLACES the
 *             previous scroll-snap answer, which was designed when no board
 *             drawing existed and is exactly the scroller the chapter now
 *             forbids.
 *  tablet   — the board, from the shared 45rem: a scrolling snapped row,
 *             two columns and a bit in view.
 *  desktop  — UNCHANGED in kind. The column stays at its measure rather than
 *             stretching to fill: a 40rem-wide column of 13/1.45 cards is a
 *             worse column, and the point of a wide screen here is MORE
 *             columns, not fatter ones. Beyond four columns the board
 *             scrolls horizontally inside the panel (27.24).
 *
 * RTL — safe. The board is a flex row, which follows the document direction;
 * the columns' order mirrors with it; every inset is `p-*` / `px-*`; the
 * scroll axis mirrors on its own. The move keys read `ArrowLeft` and
 * `ArrowRight` as PHYSICAL keys and map them to the previous and next column
 * through the document direction, which is read from the board element at the
 * moment of the press — a physical-left press in Arabic moves the card to the
 * NEXT column, which is what the finger expects.

        {/* ---- THE CARD'S HEAD — CHIPS, THEN THE TITLE ---------------------
            CLIENT, 2026-09-07, over a screenshot of a board card reading
            title-then-chips, verbatim: "in cards put chips above title."

            APPLIED HERE AND NOT OFFERED AS A PROP, which is the decision
            worth arguing rather than the swap. A `badgesPosition` would let
            two boards in the same app disagree about what a card is, and a
            kit whose components hold both answers to a question the client
            has answered is a kit that has stopped ruling. It is also the
            wrong shape for THIS component in particular: CH27.24 draws a
            board card as "only number, title, owner and age" and states "no
            status pill", so the `badges` slot is ALREADY past what the
            chapter draws. Giving an unruled affordance a second axis of
            variation is the one move a kit cannot afford. A caller who
            genuinely needs another arrangement has `content`, which is the
            documented hole for "anything else inside the card"; the ordered
            parts are not a menu.

            THE OBJECTION, AND IT IS A REAL ONE. On the RECORD page the
            client ruled the other way — 2026-08-26, KWAPSO-SPEC row 73: the
            identity chips move from above the title to "directly underneath
            the title", reversing CH27.8's own stated reason that "keys sit
            above because they tell you which record this is before you read
            what it's called". A board card now restores exactly the reason
            27.8 discarded. That is not a contradiction to reconcile, and it
            is not reconciled here: a record page is one object read at full
            size with a heading that can carry the page on its own, and a
            board card is a 13-step line in a column of twenty, where the
            chips ARE how you find the card you are looking for before you
            read any of them. Both rulings are the client's, both are
            recorded, and neither is generalised over the other.

            THE RHYTHM — WHY THE STACK'S OWN STEP IS NOT LEFT HERE.
            `CardContent` is `gap-2`, and gap is directionless, so nothing
            "breaks" when two children swap: the chips would simply keep 7.5
            (`--spacing` is 0.25rem and the root is 15px, ruling 18). Keeping
            it is still wrong, because the ROLE changed. Along the foot the
            chip row was a PEER of the meta line — last in a stack, equally
            spaced from everything, which is what it was. Above the title it
            is the title's OVERLINE, and an overline that sits at the stack's
            own step tells the reader all four rows are equally related,
            while the strongest mark on the card (a filled pill) sits at the
            top out-shouting the title it is supposed to introduce.

            SO THE NUMBER IS THE KIT'S ONE STATED NUMBER FOR A MARK ABOVE A
            TITLE — `--space-1h`, written in `title.tsx` as "6 under the
            eyebrow, and nothing at all without one" — and it is taken rather
            than a new one chosen. What it buys, measured at the 15px root
            and counting each text line's half-leading, because a filled pill
            has none (its border-box IS its edge):

              chips → title   5.625 + (15.234 - 12.1875)/2  =  7.15
              title → meta    7.5 + 1.52 + (14.953 - 10.3125)/2 = 11.34

            7.15 against 11.34 is a head and a body. At the old 7.5 it would
            have been 9.02 against 11.34 — a difference too small to group
            anything, which is the "gap sized for the old order" this avoids.

            AND THE `mt` NEEDS THE WRAPPER. A margin inside a flex column ADDS
            to the gap (7.5 + 6), so the only way to get UNDER the stack's
            step without a negative margin is to make the head one flex item
            and space it internally. That is precisely how `title.tsx`
            builds its own eyebrow-and-heading pair, so the construction is
            borrowed too, not just the number.

            BOTH PARTS ARE GUARDED, AND THE WHOLE HEAD IS.
              · chips, no title — chips then the meta line, closed up. The
                title's `<p>` is not drawn, so there is no empty 15.234 line
                box sitting in the middle of the card. (Before today an empty
                title drew that hole at the TOP, where it was easy to miss;
                the reorder would have moved it into plain view, which is why
                the guard is added now rather than left.)
              · title, no chips — no `mt`, no chip row, and the head is one
                `<p>` in a `<div>` whose box is identical to the bare `<p>`
                this used to be. Preflight zeroes the paragraph's margins, so
                a card with no chips renders at exactly the metrics it did
                before this change.
              · neither — no head at all, rather than an empty div taking a
                gap on both sides.

            THE ORDER IS THE DOM'S, NOT `order:`. A CSS reorder would leave a
            pressable card (`role="button"`) announcing its name in the old
            sequence while the eye reads the new one. So the spoken name of a
            card DOES change with this ruling — chips first, then title —
            and that is correct: what is seen first is what is said first.
            No `aria-label` is invented to paper over it; this file's law is
            that every user-facing string is a prop, and a label here would
            be the component writing one. */}
