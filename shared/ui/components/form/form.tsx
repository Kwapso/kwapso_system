/* ============================================================================
   Form — the shell every form in both apps renders through.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t9.css → chapter 9's form layout,
   transcribed figure for figure:

     .kw-form        display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr;
                     gap: var(--space-4) var(--space-6);
     @media (min-width: 48rem) { .kw-form { grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr } }
     .kw-form__full  grid-column: 1 / -1;

   The kit's own words above that block: "Two columns on desktop, 16px row
   gap, 22px column gap; a form never exceeds two columns." The 22 is off the
   spacing ladder and the kit snapped it to `--space-6` (24) itself, logging
   the snap as T9-5; the breakpoint is the kit's own provisional 48rem (T9-6).
   Both are taken as given here rather than re-derived.

     .kw-savebar        display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center;
                        gap: var(--space-3);
                        border-top: 1px solid var(--hair);
                        padding-top: var(--space-4);
     .kw-savebar__meta  margin-left: auto;

   design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-patterns.css → `.kw-modal__fields`
   (`padding: var(--space-6)`, a column at `--space-4`) for the section stack,
   and CH21's `.kw-register` for the error register.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · A FORM IS A GRID OF `Field`s AND NOTHING ELSE. This file draws no label,
     no help line, no error message and no control. `field.tsx` owns all four
     and is called 154 times; a second drawing of a form row here would be two
     systems for one job. What this file owns is the GRID, the SECTIONS, the
     SUMMARY and the SAVE BAR.
   · NEVER A THIRD COLUMN. The kit says it in those words. `columns` accepts
     `1` and `2`; there is no `3`, and adding one would be inventing a layout
     the kit refused.
   · THE SAVE BAR IS END-ALIGNED, PRIMARY LAST. Ruled 2026-08-22 and inherited
     here rather than re-argued — the kit's own `.kw-savebar` is start-aligned,
     and it loses for the two reasons written in `sheet.tsx`'s footer. This
     file therefore keeps the save bar's RULE, INSET and META SLOT from the
     kit and takes its alignment from `ActionRow align="end"`, which already
     encodes the ruling including the reversed column below 40rem.
   · A SUBMITTING FORM IS NOT A DISABLED FORM. `loading` sets `aria-busy`,
     puts the spinner in the submit control and freezes the fieldset so the
     same form cannot be sent twice — but the fields keep their own fills. A
     greyed-out form mid-submit says the request failed.
   · Disabled is a fill and an ink. It is delivered by a real
     `<fieldset disabled>`, so every control inside reaches its OWN disabled
     skin — which is a fill and an ink in every primitive already. No opacity
     is written here and none is needed.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). This file rings nothing and
     writes no `outline`.
   · Every user-facing string is a prop with a default.
   · No product vocabulary (commission §11). The words here are "form",
     "section", "field", "summary".

   WHY THE ERROR SUMMARY IS AN `Alert` AND THE FAILED SAVE IS A REGISTER
   Two different failures, two different drawings, and conflating them is the
   commonest form bug in an application:
     · `errors` — the form was filled in wrongly. The fields are still there
       and still correct to show. That is an inline `Alert variant="destructive"`
       at the head of the form, listing what to fix, with each entry able to
       carry the id of the field it belongs to.
     · `error` — the form could not be LOADED. There is nothing to fill in.
       That is CH21's `.kw-register` INSTEAD of the form, with one next step.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. `React.useId` is a hook, used to tie the summary to the
   form; the module also creates a submit handler during its own render.

 * the only way "Postcode" is heard as "Delivery address, Postcode".
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — the legend, the description, the grid.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply. A section is a container, not a target.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once; a
 *                      `<fieldset>` is not focusable and the fields inside it
 *                      ring themselves.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply.
 *  5. disabled       — the native `disabled` attribute, which disables every
 *                      control inside at once. Each one then draws its OWN
 *                      disabled skin — a fill and an ink in every primitive —
 *                      so nothing here writes a state. The legend keeps its
 *                      primary ink: a group that cannot be filled in still
 *                      needs saying what it is.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply to a section. The FORM is what goes
 *                      busy; a section whose values are still arriving passes
 *                      `loading` to its own fields, which take the read-only
 *                      skin (`input.tsx`).
 *  7. empty          — no children renders the legend and an empty grid. A
 *                      section with nothing in it is a call-site bug and is
 *                      not papered over.
 *  8. error          — does not apply at the section level. An invalid FIELD
 *                      draws its own 65% poppy border and its ink message;
 *                      colouring a whole group would say every field in it is
 *                      wrong.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply.
 * 10. read-only      — passed to the fields, which lose their borders
 *                      (chapter 9: "system-set values lose the border").
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile   — one column, from the grid below.
 *  tablet   — two columns from 48rem, unless `columns={1}`.
 *  desktop  — UNCHANGED from tablet. Never a third column; the kit says so.
 *
 * RTL — safe. `border-t` and `pt-*` are on the block axis; the grid follows
 * the document direction; nothing is positioned by side.

    /* THE RULE HAS TO BE OUTSIDE THE `<fieldset>`, NOT PAINTED ON IT AND NOT
       RENDERED INSIDE IT EITHER — a second attempt at this fix got that
       wrong, and it is worth the record. `divided` originally added
       `shadow-[var(--hairline-over)]`, an INSET box-shadow painted at the
       fieldset's own border-box top edge, plus `pt-space-6` to push flow
       content clear of it. Padding cannot move a shadow, and a `<legend>` is
       laid out by the BROWSER to straddle a fieldset's top edge — the exact
       pixel the shadow was drawn on — so `title` and the rule collided every
       time both were set.

       The first fix swapped the shadow for a real `Separator`, but left it
       as the fieldset's OWN first child. That does not work: a `<legend>`
       is hoisted to the fieldset's rendered top by the browser regardless of
       how many non-legend siblings precede it inside the same fieldset — the
       spec picks the first `legend` CHILD, not the first child. Measured
       live in the demo, the separator landed at 24px INSIDE the fieldset,
       directly under the heading it was meant to sit above — the collision
       was gone, but the rule now separated the heading from its own fields
       instead of separating this section from the one before it.

       So the rule is a REAL PRECEDING SIBLING of the `<fieldset>`, rendered
       through a `Fragment` rather than as fieldset content — `<legend>`
       stays the fieldset's own direct child throughout, which is required
       for a screen reader to read it as the group's name at all (RULES: a
       `<legend>` nested one element deeper is not a fieldset's legend).

       THE SPACING IS NOT REBUILT, IT IS INHERITED. `Form` already wraps
       every top-level section in one flex column at `gap-[var(--space-6)]`
       (`inferredSectioned`, below). A `Fragment`'s children are not a DOM
       wrapper — they render as ordinary flex items of that same column, so
       adding one more item (the separator) before this section's `fieldset`
       gives it exactly one more `--space-6` gap on each side, for free: one
       `--space-6` from whatever precedes it (the previous section, or
       nothing, if this is the form's first section) to the rule, and
       another `--space-6` from the rule to this fieldset's own top — which
       is where the legend already sits. That is the same total, `2 ×
       --space-6`, the old shadow-plus-padding spent (one `--space-6` from
       `Form`'s own gap between sections, one `--space-6` of this fieldset's
       own padding) — no new margin, no new gap utility, nothing hand-tuned.
       `decorative` stays at `Separator`'s own default (`true`): the
       section's name is read from the legend, and the rule carries no
       information of its own. */

/**
 * The shell every form renders through.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — title, description, summary slot, the grid, save bar.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply to the shell. Every hover belongs to a
 *                      control inside it; a form that washed under the
 *                      pointer would fight the field the pointer is over.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      at the control's own radius. A `<form>` is not
 *                      focusable and this file adds no ring and no
 *                      `outline: none`.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply to the shell; the submit control has it.
 *  5. disabled       — `disabled`: a real `<fieldset disabled>` around the
 *                      fields, so every control reaches its own disabled skin,
 *                      which is a fill and an ink in every primitive. The save
 *                      bar's controls are disabled too — a form nobody may
 *                      fill in cannot be submitted. No opacity anywhere.
 *  6. loading        — `loading`: `aria-busy` on the form, the fieldset frozen
 *                      so it cannot be sent twice, and the submit control
 *                      keeping its own fill with a spinner (`button.tsx`'s
 *                      rule: the kit draws a submitting button as itself, not
 *                      as a dead one). The FIELDS keep their skins.
 *  7. empty          — no children renders the head and the save bar with an
 *                      empty grid between them. A form with no fields is a
 *                      call-site bug and is not papered over — and it must
 *                      still show its commit control, because a form whose
 *                      only content is a confirmation is a real form.
 *  8. error          — TWO, and they are different things. `errors` is "you
 *                      filled it in wrongly": an inline `Alert
 *                      variant="destructive"` at the head, listing what to
 *                      fix, each entry linking to its control. `error` is
 *                      "there is no form to fill in": CH21's `.kw-register`
 *                      INSTEAD of the form, with one next step.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. A form is not a chooser; the selected
 *                      thing is a value inside a control.
 * 10. read-only      — passed down. Each control loses its border (chapter 9:
 *                      "system-set values lose the border") and the save bar
 *                      is the caller's to withdraw with `hideActions`.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile   — ONE column. The kit's `.kw-form` starts at `1fr` and this is
 *             it, unchanged. The save bar becomes a reversed column so the
 *             commit control spans the row.
 *  tablet   — TWO columns from 48rem — chapter 9's own provisional breakpoint
 *             (t9.css, T9-6), 16 between rows and 24 between the columns. The
 *             save bar becomes the end-aligned row at 40rem, which is
 *             `ActionRow`'s breakpoint and lands first.
 *  desktop  — UNCHANGED from tablet, and this is the load-bearing one: the
 *             kit says "and never a third". A wider viewport gives each field
 *             more measure, not the form more columns.
 *
 * RTL — safe. The grid is on the inline axis and follows the document
 * direction; `gap-x-*`, `me-auto`, `px-*` and `col-span-full` carry no side.
 * The summary's links are ordinary in-page anchors and need nothing.
