   Compare — collection view 22, "two to four records as columns" (0 direct
   call sites; a body swap for `CollectionFrame`).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   Kit chapter 19 ("Collection views"), view 22, read out of
   `Design Mothership/kit-current/Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html`. The chapter's own
   line for it, verbatim from the view table:

       compare · "Two to four records as columns"
               · fits "Audit findings, options, quotes"
               · switch label "Compare"

   and the contract the whole chapter is built on, also verbatim:

       "Every view carries the same contract: search, filters, three actions,
        view switch. Only the body below the toolbar changes."

   THE DRAWING, transcribed
     · the frame  — `grid-template-columns: 130px repeat(3, 1fr)`, `gap: 12px`
     · the labels — a column with `padding-top: 54px`, which is what clears
                    the head of the record columns beside it, then one label
                    per row at 12px tertiary, `padding: 9px 0`, each on
                    `inset 0 -1px 0 var(--hair)`
     · a column   — `var(--card)` at radius 24, `padding: 14px 16px`,
                    `gap: 4px`; the record name at 14/500 with
                    `padding-bottom: 12px`; then one value per row at 13px,
                    `padding: 9px 0`, the same hairline under each, tabular

   TWO TO FOUR, AND THE ARTIFACT MEANS IT
   The prose says two to four and the drawing shows three. Fewer than two is
   not a comparison — it is a record, and `DetailView` draws that. More than
   four does not fit the frame at any width the system supports. So: fewer
   than two renders the empty register, and columns past the fourth are
   dropped rather than squeezed. Neither is invented; both are the sentence.

   COMPOSE, DO NOT REBUILD
   A column is a `Card`. The hairline under every row is `--hairline-under`,
   the named form of the artifact's own `inset 0 -1px 0 var(--hair)`. There is
   no `border` in this file, on anything, in any state.

   ROWS ARE POSITIONAL, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING
   Row three of the label column has to be row three of every record column
   or the comparison lies. `values` is therefore indexed against `labels`, and
   a column with fewer values draws its missing rows as `emptyValueLabel` —
   which has NO default, because the system prefers nothing to an invented
   dash (PATTERN §4) and only the call site knows whether a blank means
   "none" or "not asked".

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   No `"use client"`. It forwards props and a ref, holds no state, calls no
   hook and creates no handler during its own render.

/**
 * Two to four records, side by side, row for row.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — a label column and two to four record columns.
 *  2. hover          — NONE. A comparison is a reading; the artifact draws no
 *                      hover on a column or a row, and a row that washed
 *                      under the pointer would suggest it can be pressed.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *                      This body holds no control.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply, for the same reason as hover.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. A comparison is a layout. A record the
 *                      reader may not open is absent from it (ch24.6:
 *                      permissions hide), never a greyed column.
 *  6. loading        — `loading`: `Skeleton` rows inside the real column
 *                      shells, so the frame does not move when the values
 *                      land.
 *  7. empty          — fewer than two columns, no labels, or `empty`: the
 *                      quiet register. One record is not a comparison, and
 *                      saying so is better than drawing half a table.
 *  8. error          — `error`: the register with a poppy dot. Beats `empty`.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. The artifact marks no column as the
 *                      chosen one; its own drawing puts the recommendation in
 *                      a row called "Decision", in WORDS. This view may not
 *                      invent a highlighted column, which would also be a
 *                      second mango on the screen.
 * 10. read-only      — always. A comparison holds no value.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS, and the 380 answer
 *  · mobile (base) — the comparison SCROLLS sideways inside its own box, with
 *    the label column keeping its measure and each record column keeping a
 *    readable minimum. It does NOT restack into one column per record: a
 *    comparison whose columns are stacked is no longer a comparison, it is
 *    two records in a row, and row three of one no longer sits beside row
 *    three of the other. The kit states no narrow behaviour for this view —
 *    logged as GAPS-TRACK2B CMP-2, and this is the reading that keeps the
 *    view's one purpose intact.
 *  · tablet (`sm:`) / desktop (`lg:`) — UNCHANGED, and by then it fits. The
 *    record columns are `1fr` and share the width, exactly as drawn.
 *
 * RTL — safe, and unused: the system is LTR only (ruling 10). Every inset is
 * logical and no side is named.
