   DataTable — the real table: sort, select, sticky header, row hover,
   pagination, virtualisation.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   Nothing new is drawn here. Every mark on the screen already exists as a
   primitive and this file only assembles them:

     `Table` / `TableHeader` / `TableBody` / `TableRow` / `TableHead` /
     `TableCell` / `TableCaption`   — the kit's `.kw-matrix` (f3.css), the
                                      56 row, the hairlines, the row wash
     `Checkbox`                     — chapter 10's mark, including the mixed bar
     `Pagination*`                  — the page strip
     `SortControl`                  — the key-and-direction pair
     `Skeleton`                     — the loading rows
     `Button` / `buttonVariants`    — every control, including the header sorter
     `useVirtualRows`               — which rows exist in the DOM
     kwapso-ui.css `.kw-empty`      — the centred empty register
     kwapso-patterns.css `.kw-register` (CH21) — the error register

   If a class in this file draws a cell, a rule, a fill or a radius that a
   primitive already draws, that is a bug in this file.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · THE ROW IS 56 AT EVERY WIDTH. `TableRow` sets it from
     `--control-height-row` and this file never overrides it. There is no
     dense DataTable, because ruling 28 names one number for a table row.
   · THE MOBILE ANSWER IS SCROLL, NOT RESTACK, AND NOT COLUMN-DROPPING.
     Inherited verbatim from `table.tsx`, which argues it at length: a card
     stack breaks the one thing a table is for (reading a column down), and a
     table that hides a column at a width has changed WHAT IT SAYS rather than
     how it looks. So this file offers no `hideBelow` on a column. What it
     DOES offer at mobile is a second way IN to the same sort state — see
     `showSortControl`.
   · SORT IS ONE STATE WITH TWO DOORS. The header cell's button and the
     `SortControl` above the table drive the same `sortKey` / `sortDirection`.
     Two controls that disagreed about the order of the same rows would be a
     worse bug than either being absent.
   · SELECTION IS A `Checkbox`, AND THE HEADER ONE GOES MIXED. Chapter 10
     draws "inverse fill + light bar" for the mixed state and `Checkbox`
     already carries it; `checked="indeterminate"` is passed, never faked.
   · A STICKY HEADER MUST BE OPAQUE, AND IT MUST STICK TO SOMETHING. It sticks
     to the element this file gives the `maxHeight` to, which is also the
     element `useVirtualRows` scrolls. `TableHeader sticky` takes
     `--background`; a table dropped on a card passes `headerClassName="bg-card"`,
     the surface swap `table.tsx` says the call site owns (GAPS-D TBL-2).
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). Nothing here rings, nothing
     here writes `outline`, and the scroll shell carries `scroll-p-1` so a
     ring on a control in an off-screen column is scrolled into view whole.
   · Disabled is a fill and an ink. `TableRow disabled` already is one.
   · Every user-facing string is a prop with a default, including the ones
     only a screen reader hears.
   · No product vocabulary (commission §11). Rows, columns, keys, pages.

   WHY THE SCROLL SHELL IS THIS FILE'S AND NOT `Table`'S
   `Table` renders its own container with `overflow-x: auto`, which is right
   for a table that scrolls the page vertically. A table with a STICKY HEADER
   or a VIRTUAL WINDOW needs a bounded, vertically scrolling box, and it needs
   a ref onto it — `Table`'s `containerProps` is `ComponentPropsWithoutRef`, so
   a ref cannot be passed through it. So this file wraps its own shell, takes
   both axes, and neutralises `Table`'s inner overflow with
   `containerClassName="overflow-x-visible"`. One scroll container, which is
   the only arrangement in which `position: sticky` resolves against the box
   the reader is actually scrolling. GAPS-COL2 DTB-1.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. Hooks (`useVirtualRows`, `useState`, `useMemo`,
   `useCallback`) and event handlers created during render.

   THE ERROR REGISTER IS THE SHARED ONE — `CollectionRegister`.

   CH21's `.kw-register` was declared LOCALLY in six files, byte-for-byte the
   same markup in every one of them, and one record could show two different
   copies of it at once (a `detail-view` rendering a `DescriptionList`). The
   values inside all six were corrected in place on 2026-08-23, so nothing
   drew wrongly; six chances to drift is the defect, and this is the follow-up
   GAPS-FIDELITY-DE L-2 wrote out. `variant="block"` IS `.kw-register` — the
   panel tone at the 24 radius, `--space-7` inset, left-aligned per 27.21 —
   and `tone="error"` is the 7px poppy dot CH21 puts on exactly one of its
   four registers.

   `.kw-empty` STAYS LOCAL, and that is not an oversight. It is a different
   kit object: one line of words at the 14 step in tertiary ink, not an
   eyebrow / title / body / action column. `CollectionRegister`'s `inline`
   variant carries `.kw-empty`'s box but not its step or its ink, so folding
   the two together would either shrink this register's words or hand every
   inline register a container ink its title would inherit. Logged rather
   than forced.

   the header cell's own type (`text-micro`, tertiary ink), which `TableHead`
   sets on the cell and a `<button>` inside it would otherwise reset.

   the cell's edges instead of floating inside them. NOT `uppercase` — client

   a `<button>` needs it stated, not inherited — and now restates nothing

  /* ---- opening a record ---------------------------------------------------
     THE RULE IS THE ARTIFACT'S, AND IT IS ONE RULE. Chapter 26 §3, the
     list/collection page dev note, verbatim: "A row's name is always the
     first, widest column and always clickable to open the detail page or a
     quick-view." So the press target is the NAME CELL, not the `<tr>`.

     That single sentence answers the three things a pressable row usually
     has to argue about, which is why it is followed rather than improved on:

       · KEYBOARD. The name becomes a real `<button>`. It is focusable
         because it is a button, Enter and Space work because it is a button,
         and it lands in the tab order in reading position. Nothing here sets
         `role`, `tabIndex` or a key handler. Chapter 06 requires exactly
         this — "nothing interactive may be built from a non-focusable
         element … real buttons, inputs and links, or an element with a role
         and a tabindex" — and a `<tr onClick>` would have broken it.

       · NESTED CONTROLS. A row that opens a record and a row carrying a
         checkbox, a menu and inline controls do not fight, because the open
         target never covers them: it is one cell wide. There is no
         `stopPropagation`, no "the row opens except on a control" exception,
         and therefore no per-screen special case. The artifact rules nothing
         on nested controls (checked: no click-target, hit-area or
         propagation guidance anywhere in the document) — it does not need
         to, because confining the target removes the collision instead of
         adjudicating it.

       · THE ROW'S OWN STATES ARE UNTOUCHED. `TableRow` already draws the
         hover wash (`--accent`) and the chosen wash (`--surface-selected`,
         override 44) and this file adds neither. `--surface-selected` was
         read and does NOT apply here: it is the CHOSEN-record paper, the one
         the checkbox sets, and a row that can be opened is not thereby
         chosen. Painting it on press or hover would make "openable" and
         "ticked" the same colour and tell the reader nothing — the same
         argument `table.tsx` already makes for why selected cannot take
         `--accent`.

     Chapter 17 and 27.1 contradict each other here and neither is followed:
     17 draws an inert row whose only live things are the checkbox and an
     unexplained pinned arrow, 27.1 makes the whole row `onClick → toggle`
     so that clicking anywhere SELECTS. The chapter 26 dev note is the only
     place in the document that rules on opening a record from a row, so it
     wins. Logged in KWAPSO-SPEC.md register row 58.

/**
 * The system's table.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — the header band on `--hair-strong`, 56 rows on
 *                      `--border`, the page strip under it. Nothing drawn
 *                      here that a primitive does not draw.
 *  2. hover          — `bg-accent` on the row, from `TableRow`. The kit's
 *                      neutral wash, never mango, never an opacity. The
 *                      header sorter takes `Button variant="ghost"`'s own
 *                      `--accent`, which is the same wash — correct, because
 *                      both are "the thing under the pointer".
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      at the control's own radius. This file adds none and
 *                      hides none: the scroll shell is `overflow-auto` and
 *                      never `hidden`, and it carries `scroll-p-1` (4) —
 *                      more than the ring's 2 offset plus 2 width — so
 *                      tabbing to a control in an off-screen column brings it
 *                      into view ring and all. A sticky header is
 *                      `position: sticky`, which paints in place without
 *                      clipping, so a ring on a pinned sorter is whole.
 *  4. active/pressed — the controls': the sorter takes `Button`'s 1px nudge,
 *                      the page links take theirs. A ROW is not pressed — a
 *                      table row is not a button (`table.tsx` state 4), and a
 *                      row that navigates puts a control in its first cell.
 *  5. disabled       — per row, via `isRowDisabled`: `TableRow disabled`,
 *                      which is `--btn-disabled-fill` / `--btn-disabled-label`
 *                      with the hover dropped, plus `aria-disabled`. Its
 *                      checkbox is disabled with it. A fill and an ink; no
 *                      opacity is written anywhere in this file.
 *  6. loading        — `loading`: `Skeleton` cells in `loadingRows` rows, the
 *                      HEADER KEPT, `aria-busy` on the shell, the empty
 *                      register suppressed, and the page strip and the sort
 *                      controls frozen — re-sorting a list that is still
 *                      arriving asks the server twice and shows whichever
 *                      answer lands last (`sort-control.tsx`'s own reason).
 *  7. empty          — `.kw-empty`, the centred register, inside one
 *                      full-width cell, with the header still above it so the
 *                      reader can see what the table WOULD have shown. Never
 *                      a skeleton: a skeleton over an established emptiness is
 *                      a lie. `emptyAction` puts one next step under it.
 *  8. error          — `.kw-register`, the left-aligned panel card: a 7 poppy
 *                      dot, its eyebrow, a title, a sentence and one next
 *                      step. Announced as an alert. It replaces the BODY, not
 *                      the frame, so the columns stay legible.
 *  9. selected       — per row: `TableRow selected` (`--surface-panel`, and
 *                      `data-state="selected"`), plus the row's `Checkbox`.
 *                      Both channels, always — colour alone must never carry
 *                      a meaning. The header checkbox goes
 *                      `checked="indeterminate"` on a partial selection, which
 *                      is chapter 10's drawn mixed state and not a faked one.
 *                      ACROSS THE TABLE it is CH17's BULK BAR: a charcoal
 *                      pill in normal flow 14 under the rows, holding the
 *                      count, a divider, the actions and one mango control.
 *                      It is drawn only when `bulkActions` or
 *                      `bulkPrimaryAction` is given, and it TAKES OVER the
 *                      live-region sentence rather than sitting beside it.
 *                      Nothing here floats: SHELL.md's law is that a
 *                      selection takes an existing slot, never the bottom of
 *                      the viewport.
 * 10. read-only      — the default and the only mode. This component displays
 *                      rows; an editable grid is a call site putting `Input`
 *                      inside `column.cell`, and every field it puts there
 *                      draws its own states.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile   — the table SCROLLS ON THE INLINE AXIS inside its own shell. It
 *             does NOT restack into cards and it does NOT drop a column —
 *             both are argued in full in `table.tsx`'s header and in the law
 *             block above. What changes instead is the way IN to the sort:
 *             the `SortControl` above the table is visible below 40rem, so
 *             the order can be changed without reaching a header cell that
 *             has scrolled out of sight. The page strip WRAPS to a second
 *             line (`PaginationContent`'s own answer) rather than shrinking,
 *             and a caller who wants fewer numbers passes `siblingCount={0}`.
 *  tablet   — the same table, usually with nothing left to scroll. The
 *             `SortControl` is withdrawn at 40rem, because the header cells
 *             are now reachable and two visible doors into one state is
 *             clutter. `sortControlAlways` keeps it.
 *  desktop  — UNCHANGED. The row is 56 at all three widths, the type step is
 *             one step at all three, and the only variable is whether the
 *             shell has anything to scroll. A sticky header, where asked for,
 *             is sticky at every width: it is the columns staying over their
 *             data, which is not a wide-screen luxury.
 *
 * RTL — safe. `overflow` mirrors with the writing direction; every inset is
 * `px-*` / `-mx-*` (padding- and margin-inline); the sorter's glyph is
 * vertical (up/down) and needs no mirroring; the page strip's own chevrons
 * are `pagination.tsx`'s business and it mirrors them itself. No `left`,
 * `right`, `pl-*` or `pr-*` appears in this file.

                                       This cell used to carry

                                       hover:underline` — the kit's own

                                       underline on hover. NOT mango". That was
                                       a considered decision, not an oversight,
                                       and the reasoning against mango still
                                       stands (a mango name on every row would
                                       spend override 17's one action per
                                       screen many times over).

                                       The client compared two live screenshots
                                       and ruled against the underline
                                       specifically, verbatim: "i want that the
                                       navigation is like in the first
                                       screenshot (the whole row is marked as
                                       hover) not like in the second one (the
                                       title gets underlined)." This is a new
                                       ruling overriding the old one, not a bug
                                       fix — the underline was doing exactly
                                       what it was built to do.

                                       So the underline is gone and NOTHING
                                       replaces it on this button: the ROW
                                       already washes the whole row on hover —
                                       `table.tsx`'s `TableRow` carries
                                       `ROW_DEFAULT = "motion-row-hover
                                       hover:bg-accent"` underneath every cell
                                       in this row, unmodified — so removing
                                       the underline is the whole change. Two
                                       hover treatments on one row was already
                                       one too many before this ruling; it
                                       would still be one too many if this
                                       button grew a fill of its own now. */

            500 tabular, a 1-wide `--invhair2` divider, the quiet actions,
            and the mango control at the far end.

            THE ONE FIGURE THAT IS NOT THE CHAPTER'S IS THE 22, AND IT IS
            SAID OUT LOUD: ruling 28's ladder is eleven 4px steps plus four
            2px half-steps (6, 10, 14, 18), and 22 is on neither. Override 41
            already set the precedent for exactly this case — a drawn inset
            off the ladder steps to its ladder neighbour — so the leading
            inset is `--space-5` (20). Every other figure here is drawn.

            IT REPLACES THE SELECTION SENTENCE, IT DOES NOT FLOAT. Nothing in
            this system rises off the bottom of the viewport: SHELL.md's rule
            is that a selection "takes the toolbar's exact slot and height",
            and CH17's own drawing puts this bar in normal flow 14 under the
            rows. `.bg-surface-inverse` rebinds `--hair`, `--hair-strong` and
            the descendants' `--focus` (tokens.css), so the divider and every
            ring inside the bar flip with the ground and no colour is written
            here. GAPS-FIDELITY-DE L-4. */}

               descendants' `--focus`; it does NOT do it for the two text
               inks, so `Button variant="ghost"` — the kit's own quiet
               control, and what a caller reaches for here — printed
               `--ink-tertiary` (a charcoal grey) on a charcoal bar, and its
               hover went to `--foreground`, which is charcoal outright.
               Rebinding is the same mechanism and reaches every control a
               call site puts in the bar, instead of making each one know it
               is standing on ink. THE DURABLE FIX BELONGS IN tokens.css's
               `.bg-surface-inverse` BLOCK and is owed — logged in
               GAPS-KIT-DE.md; `tokens/tokens.css` is not this pass's to
               edit. Neither value is invented: `--ink-on-inverse-secondary`
               is the artifact's own `--invfg2` (override 13) and
