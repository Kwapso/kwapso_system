   CalendarView — month grid, day cell, event chip, agenda (0 direct call sites).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   Two drawings in `Design Mothership/kit-current/Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html`, read
   directly because neither was ever transcribed into the specimen set:

   Kit chapter 19 ("Collection views"), view 05 "calendar" — the full one:
     · weekday row — `grid-template-columns: repeat(7, 1fr); gap: 6px;
                      padding: 4px 4px 8px`, each label 11 / 500 / uppercase /
                      0.08em tracking, tertiary ink
     · the grid    — `repeat(7, 1fr); grid-auto-rows: 1fr; gap: 6px`
     · a cell      — radius 24, inset 8/9, a column at gap 6, `overflow: hidden`
     · the day     — 11, tabular, quieted
     · an event    — mango pill, charcoal label, 10, inset 2/7, full width,
                     single line, ellipsis

   Kit chapter 18 ("Data display"), the block captioned "August 2026 · week 34
   highlighted" — the small one:
     · cells `aspect-ratio: 1 / 1` at the same radius and inset
     · the day at 12, tabular
     · an event reduced to a 6 dot in `--inv`, because a chip does not fit

   Kit chapter 19, view 10 "agenda" — the list form:
     · day label — 12 / 500 / uppercase / 0.08em, inset 4/12/6
     · a row     — `grid-template-columns: 64px 1fr auto; gap: 14px;
                    align-items: center; padding: 12px;
                    box-shadow: inset 0 -1px 0 var(--hair)`
     · the time  — 13, tertiary, tabular · the title 14 · the who 12, tertiary

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · This component does NO DATE MATHS and holds no calendar. It renders the
     cells it is handed. Ruling 07 makes date format follow the APP language
     rather than the browser — "13 Jun 2026, 14:05 in English, 13. Juni 2026,
     14:05 in German" — which a component cannot know, so every label here is
     a node the caller supplies and nothing is formatted internally. That also
     means no `Intl` call, no week-start assumption, and no locale baked in.
   · Ruling 02: nothing hardcodes 9, 10 or 11 any more, and uppercase eyebrows
     keep 11. So the weekday labels stay at `text-micro` (they ARE uppercase
     eyebrows) and the kit's 10 event chip and 11 day number both step up to
     12 — `text-badge` and `text-xs`. Logged as GAPS-COL1 CV-2.
   · An unqualified event chip is MANGO, which is what the artifact draws.
     OVERRIDE 17 (2026-08-23, verify/decisions.html Q2) settles this: "'One
     mango per screen' counts ACTIONS, not objects. One filled control you
     can press; any number of non-interactive marks." A month's event chips
     are marks that identify a record, not actions, so the twenty-mango-chips
     argument this file used to make is the reading the override retires -
     the same reading that would have taken the mango off 27.34's unread rows
     and off the triage sitting's figure. CH19 view 05 draws
     `background: var(--mango); color: #1A1918`, and that now stands. The
     quiet chip survives as `tone="quiet"` for a caller who wants it.
   · Mango means "where you are" and charcoal means "what you picked" —
     `.kw-stage--current` is mango and the segmented control's on-state
     (`ToggleGroup`, `ModeToggle`) is charcoal. Today is therefore the mango cell and the selected day is the
     charcoal one, which keeps at most one of each on screen.
   · The cell radius is the box radius, 24. There is no fifth radius, and a
     calendar cell is a box.
   · Focus is one global rule (tokens.css §8). A selectable day is a real
     button and is ringed already; the grid sets no `overflow: hidden` on the
     wrapper, so the ring is never shaved.
   · No product vocabulary. These are DAYS and EVENTS.
   · THE MORE-LINE IS A CONTROL THE MOMENT SOMETHING CAN OPEN IT, 2026-09-07.
     GAPS-COL1 CV-3 added "+N more" so a busy day would SAY how many it was
     not showing instead of losing them under `overflow: hidden` — and it
     was text, with no gesture. `formatMoreEvents` changed the words and
     nothing changed what they did. A count of hidden records that cannot
     be opened is a locked door with a sign on it, and the consuming app
     had to fold its overflow into a fake event chip with a sentinel id to
     get a click at all. `onSelectMore` makes the line a real `<button>`
     when a handler is given — the same rule `onSelectEvent` already
     applies to a chip and `onSelectDay` to a cell: given, a control;
     absent, the same text it always was, and no tab stop. It hands back
     the day and the events the cell did not show, so the caller can open
     them without recounting.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"` — the day and event handlers are created during this
   module's own render.

/**
 * A month grid, and the same period as an agenda.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — seven columns of paper cells under a quiet weekday
 *                      row, each cell a day number and up to `maxEvents`
 *                      chips; or, in `agenda`, day headings over hairline-
 *                      separated rows.
 *  2. hover          — only on a SELECTABLE cell, chip or more-line:
 *                      `--accent`, the neutral row and item wash, and only
 *                      on the three unfilled states. A mango or charcoal
 *                      cell washed with 5% charcoal reads as dirt, so those
 *                      two keep their fill — the same reasoning `Card` uses
 *                      for its two coloured variants. Never mango as a
 *                      hover, never an opacity. The more-line, when it is a
 *                      control, also lifts its ink to the foreground.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      at the control's own radius. A selectable day is a
 *                      real `button` and is reachable already.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply to a cell. The kit draws no pressed
 *                      day, and a cell that nudged would shift the whole row
 *                      it sits in. The header's two steps are Buttons and
 *                      nudge as every Button does.
 *  5. disabled       — per day (`day.disabled`) and per agenda item:
 *                      `--surface-quiet` and `--ink-disabled`, and no button
 *                      is rendered at all, so it is neither hoverable nor
 *                      focusable. A fill and an ink.
 *  6. loading        — `loading`: a placeholder grid of the same shape, so
 *                      nothing reflows when the period lands. Cold cache
 *                      only; a warm re-fetch keeps the month on screen and
 *                      marks it busy, because blanking a calendar the reader
 *                      is scanning loses their place.
 *  7. empty          — a month with no `days` at all is a calendar that has
 *                      not been given one, and shows the quiet register. A
 *                      month with days but NO EVENTS is not empty — it is an
 *                      empty month, and it draws its cells, because the grid
 *                      is the answer. In `agenda`, no days shows the register:
 *                      an agenda with nothing in it has nothing to draw.
 *  8. error          — `error`: the register with a poppy dot and its own
 *                      wording. Beats `empty`.
 *  9. selected       — `day.selected`: the charcoal fill, plus
 *                      `aria-pressed` on the cell so the mark is not colour
 *                      alone. At most one per view by convention; the
 *                      component does not enforce it, because a range
 *                      selection is a real case and enforcing one would
 *                      forbid it.
 * 10. read-only      — no `onSelectDay`, no `onSelectEvent` and no
 *                      `onSelectMore`: the cells, the chips and the
 *                      more-line render as plain elements. The calendar
 *                      still shows everything; only the way in is gone.
 *                      This is the honest read-only, and it is why no cell
 *                      is ever drawn with the disabled skin just because the
 *                      view is not interactive.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  · mobile (base) — the grid keeps all seven columns, because six columns is
 *    not a week. The cell becomes SQUARE (`aspect-square`, chapter 18's own
 *    small drawing) and the event CHIPS are replaced by chapter 18's 6 dots —
 *    a 45-wide cell cannot hold a chip with a readable label, and the kit
 *    solved this itself the second time it drew a calendar. The header's two
 *    steps stay at the standing 40 control height.
 *  · tablet (`sm:`, 40rem) — chapter 19's drawing: the cell grows to a 5.5rem
 *    minimum with its height set by its content, and the chips come back.
 *  · desktop — UNCHANGED from tablet. A month is seven columns at every
 *    width above a phone; the cells simply get taller as the column does.
 *  · `agenda` — UNCHANGED at all three. Its three columns are 64 + content +
 *    auto, which fits at 320, and it is the view the month grid would degrade
 *    into anyway.
 *
 * RTL — safe, and unused: the system is LTR only. The grid's column order
 * follows the writing direction, the header's steps are ordered by the
 * document rather than by side, and every inset is logical.

                ALL SEVEN HEADS ARE TERTIARY. Corrected 2026-08-23,
                GAPS-CONTRAST §2 row 7. The quiet columns were painted
                `--ink-disabled`, which measured 2.206:1 light / 3.689:1 dark
                against 4.5 while the other five sat at 5.899 / 8.807. A
                Saturday is not a disabled control — it is a day of the week,
                and the reader needs it to know which column they are in.
                This file's own DESIGN SOURCE block, read off CH19 view 05,
                says the weekday label is "11 / 500 / uppercase / 0.08em
                tracking, TERTIARY ink" for every one of the seven; the
                artifact draws no weekend distinction in the head at all.

                `quietColumns` keeps its name, its type and its default —
                the applications import this — but a tier down is now a WEIGHT
                step, 300 against the row's 500. Both weights ship (Saans is
                Light 300 and Medium 500, and `--font-weight-light` is a real
                token), so the column still reads quieter without borrowing
                the one ink that is exempt from being legible. There is no
                readable tone between tertiary and disabled to reach for. */}
