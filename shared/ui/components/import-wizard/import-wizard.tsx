   ImportWizard — upload → plan → review → run → report.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   Nothing new is drawn. Every part of the screen already exists and this file
   only sequences them:

     the rail            `StatusStepper variant="steps"` — chapter 15's
                         equal-column rail with the connector and the label
                         beneath each mark
     the drop zone       `FileUpload` — chapter 9's zone, its hint, its file
                         rows and its per-file message
     the mapping         `Form` + `Field` + `Select` — chapter 9's form grid,
                         one column below 48rem and two above, never a third
     the preview         `DataPreviewTable`, which is `DataTable` and so
                         `Table` / `Checkbox` / `Pagination` / `Skeleton` /
                         `useVirtualRows`
     the run             `Progress` — the two-tier bar, determinate and sweep
     the report          `DataPreviewTable` again, with the outcomes filled in
     the footer          `ActionRow align="end"` — the settled footer ruling,
                         including the reversed column below 40rem
     the registers       `.kw-empty` (kwapso-ui.css) and `.kw-register`
                         (kwapso-patterns.css CH21)

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · A PROPOSAL IS NOT AN ACTION. Ruling 33, verbatim: "Where the system
     guesses — the import mapping today, anything else later — the guess is
     shown with a confidence per field, the unsure ones are surfaced first,
     and nothing is written until a person presses Approve." That ruling names
     THIS component. So: a guessed mapping carries a quiet chip saying it was
     guessed, the unsure rows are sorted to the TOP of the plan step, and the
     review step's control is the only thing that starts the run.
   · THE RUN IS NOT REVERSIBLE, SO THE STEP BEFORE IT IS THE GATE. `review` is
     the last step with a back door; once `run` starts, `Back` is withdrawn
     rather than left there looking pressable.
   · THE STEPS DO NOT RENUMBER. Five stages, always all five, `maxVisible={0}`
     so the kit's over-five fold never engages on a five-stage rail. A wizard
     whose step count changed with its own progress would be unreadable.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). Nothing here rings.
   · Disabled is a fill and an ink; every control that goes dead here is a
     `Button`, which already draws one.
   · Every user-facing string is a prop with a default — including all five
     step names, which are the most-read words in the component.
   · No product vocabulary (commission §11). Sources, columns, rows, mappings,
     outcomes.

   THE ERROR REGISTER IS THE SHARED ONE — `CollectionRegister`.

   CH21's `.kw-register` was declared LOCALLY in six files, byte-for-byte the
   same markup in every one of them, and one record could show two different
   copies of it at once (a `detail-view` rendering a `DescriptionList`). The
   values inside all six were corrected in place on 2026-08-23, so nothing
   drew wrongly; six chances to drift is the defect, and this is the follow-up
   GAPS-FIDELITY-DE L-2 wrote out. `variant="block"` IS `.kw-register` — the
   panel tone at the 24 radius, `--space-7` inset, left-aligned per 27.21 —
   and `tone="error"` is the 7px poppy dot CH21 puts on exactly one of its
   four registers.

   `.kw-empty` STAYS LOCAL, and that is not an oversight. It is a different
   kit object: one line of words at the 14 step in tertiary ink, not an
   eyebrow / title / body / action column. `CollectionRegister`'s `inline`
   variant carries `.kw-empty`'s box but not its step or its ink, so folding
   the two together would either shrink this register's words or hand every
   inline register a container ink its title would inherit. Logged rather
   than forced.

 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — the rail, the step's own panel, the footer.
 *  2. hover          — the controls' only. A step panel is a region, not a
 *                      target; a rail stage that can be returned to takes
 *                      `StatusStepper`'s own hover, which is one defined step
 *                      from its own fill and never mango.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      at the control's own radius. Nothing in this file adds
 *                      or hides a ring, and no panel sets `overflow: hidden`.
 *  4. active/pressed — the controls'. `StatusStepper` and `Button` each own
 *                      their own press.
 *  5. disabled       — the continue control while `canContinue` is false, the
 *                      back control once the write has started, and the rail
 *                      while the write is in flight. Each is a `Button` or a
 *                      `StatusStepper`, and each draws a fill and an ink. No
 *                      opacity is written in this file.
 *  6. loading        — two different waits. `loading` is the STEP's own data
 *                      arriving: the panel's own component takes it —
 *                      `DataPreviewTable` shows skeleton rows, the plan step
 *                      shows its fields busy. The `run` step is not "loading"
 *                      at all: it is a determinate `Progress`, because the
 *                      number of rows is known, and the kit's own rule is
 *                      "never a spinner where a shape is known".
 *  7. empty          — per step. No columns to map: `.kw-empty` in the plan
 *                      panel. No rows in the source: `DataPreviewTable`'s own
 *                      empty register. Nothing written: `.kw-empty` in the
 *                      report panel. The rail and the footer stay in all
 *                      three, because the way OUT of an empty step is the
 *                      thing the reader now needs.
 *  8. error          — `error`: `.kw-register` replaces the step's panel and
 *                      keeps the rail, so the reader can see where they are
 *                      and go back. Announced as an alert. A per-ROW failure
 *                      is not this: it is an outcome in the report table,
 *                      drawn as a `Badge` and chapter 9's ink message.
 *  9. selected       — the current step, on the rail: `StatusStepper`'s
 *                      current mark, plus `aria-current`. AMENDED 23 SEP
 *                      2026 — the mark no longer carries mango (Aurora's
 *                      ruling, `status-stepper.tsx`'s own render-site
 *                      comment on its `steps` mark); it now shares done's ink
 *                      fill, told apart by its own number (done shows a tick)
 *                      and its extra weight. `aria-current` is unchanged and
 *                      still the second, non-colour channel. Row selection
 *                      inside the review step is `DataPreviewTable`'s.
 * 10. read-only      — the `run` and `report` steps are read-only by nature:
 *                      nothing on them can be changed, so neither draws a
 *                      control that suggests otherwise. `Back` is withdrawn
 *                      from `run` rather than disabled — a control that will
 *                      never become available should not be on the screen.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile   — ONE column throughout. The rail keeps its equal columns and
 *             ellipsises its labels rather than stacking, which is
 *             `StatusStepper`'s own stated answer and the reason the five
 *             names here are short. The plan step's grid is one column (the
 *             kit's `.kw-form` below 48rem). The preview scrolls on the
 *             inline axis inside its own shell. The footer becomes a reversed
 *             column so the commit control spans the row and stays LAST in
 *             the DOM.
 *  tablet   — the plan step goes to TWO columns at 48rem — chapter 9's own
 *             breakpoint, inherited through `Form` rather than restated. The
 *             footer becomes the end-aligned row at 40rem, which is
 *             `ActionRow`'s breakpoint and lands first.
 *  desktop  — UNCHANGED from tablet. Never a third column in the plan step;
 *             the kit says "a form never exceeds two columns" and the plan
 *             step IS a form. The preview simply has less left to scroll.
 *
 * RTL — safe. The rail's connector fills in reading order (motion.css flips
 * its `transform-origin` under `[dir="rtl"]`); the footer is `ActionRow`,
 * which names no side; the plan grid and the preview both follow the document
 * direction. Nothing here writes `left`, `right`, `pl-*` or `pr-*`.
