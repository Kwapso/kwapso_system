/* ============================================================================
   Badge — the status-coloured chip (59 direct call sites).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-ui.css → `.kw-badge`
   design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t11.css → `.kw-badge--inverse`,
   `.kw-badge--danger`, `.kw-tag--*` (chapter 11, chips and pills).

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · No border on any COLOURED pill — "colour is the whole treatment"
     (kit ruling 26). `variant="outline"` is the single uncoloured variant and
     is the only one that draws a hairline; it exists here because the
     commission requires it and because a Badge, unlike a Button, is not a
     control (see GAPS.md BDG-2).
   · Charcoal on every accent, both modes. `--destructive-foreground`,
     `--success-foreground` and `--primary-foreground` are all already
     charcoal. Trust them; never reach for white.
   · Mango (`--primary`) is a brand fill, never a status. It carries
     `variant="default"` — a count or a "3 new" — and never "warning" or
     "in build". It is OPT-IN: an unqualified <Badge> is quiet. Ruled
     2026-08-22 against verify/badge-default-comparison.html, because
     defaulting to mango put it on most rows of a list and broke the
     one-mango-per-view rule that the same kit states.
   · Radius is `--radius-pill`.
   · Separation is a FILL, never a border or a shadow — GAPS-RULINGS.md R-4c.
     `secondary`'s quiet fill is a rebindable custom property precisely so the
     one case where `--surface-quiet` reads too close to its ground (an
     ambient `--muted` field, not a card) has a real escape hatch: a caller
     rebinds `--badge-quiet-fill` to a darker quiet tone. It never reaches for
     an edge instead — this file draws no `border` anywhere but `outline`'s
     inset hairline, and that carve-out is `outline`'s alone (GAPS-REVIEW1A
     Q4), not a pattern to extend to `secondary`.
   · A count renders EMPTY, never "0" (kit `.kw-badge:empty { display:none }`).
     That is this component's empty state and its loading state both.
   · CH11 draws THREE pill geometries and this file now carries two of them:
     the 20-tall COUNTER (`size="counter"`, the default — today's geometry,
     untouched) and the 26-tall STATUS PILL / TAG (`size="pill"` —
     `--control-height-pill`, `padding: 6px 14px`, drawn label 12.5 folded to
     the badge step per the half-step rule in GAPS-FIDELITY-A L3: status text
     takes 12). Logged as GAPS-KIT-BC BDG-B1 with this exact addition written
     out; applied 2026-08-26 on the client's re-audit instruction.
   · THE STATE LIVES IN THE DOT (`dot` prop + `variant="status"`). CH11:
     "neutral fill, charcoal label, the state lives in the dot. Mango is the
     brand, never a status dot — 'in build' takes charcoal." The six dot
     tones are the six `--dot-*` tokens; ruling 04's portal three reuse them
     (With us → building, Your answer → review, Done → done). Ruling 26's
     dark clause (override 10): ONLY the charcoal-dot pill takes the mango
     fill on dark — `--pill-fill-building` / `--pill-label-building` resolve
     to the neutral pair in light and to mango/charcoal in dark, so the
     special case is the token's, not this file's.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   No `"use client"`. No hook, no state, no browser API, no event handler.

 *  1. default        — variant fill + variant ink.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply. A badge is a label, not a control. If a
 *                      call site wraps one in a button, the button owns hover.
 *  3. focus-visible  — does not apply for the same reason. Where a call site
 *                      does make it focusable, tokens.css §8 rings it globally
 *                      and this file must not add a ring.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. A label cannot be disabled; an inactive
 *                      record uses `variant="secondary"`, which is a meaning,
 *                      not a state.
 *  6. loading        — `loading`: renders nothing. Kit law — a count renders
 *                      empty, never "0", when zero OR loading.
 *  7. empty          — no children and no positive count: renders nothing
 *                      (`hideWhenEmpty`, default true).
 *  8. error          — expressed as `variant="destructive"`. A badge has no
 *                      error state of its own; it IS the error's report.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. The selectable chip is `filter-bar`'s,
 *                      which carries its own remove control.
 * 10. read-only      — always. A badge is never editable.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED. Geometry is fixed (20 tall as a
 *  counter, 26 as a status pill or tag) in all three; the badge never wraps
 *  (`whitespace-nowrap`) and never truncates. A row that runs out of width is
 *  the parent's problem to wrap or scroll — a badge that shrank would stop
 *  being the same size as its neighbours.
 *
 * RTL — safe. `px-*` is padding-inline, the dot leads by flex order, and
 * nothing is positioned by side.
