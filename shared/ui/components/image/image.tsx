/* ============================================================================
   Image — the media box (0 direct call sites, and the shape `video`,
   `web-embed` and `map` all copy).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   The kit draws no standalone image component. The three things it DOES draw
   that bear on one are used instead, and nothing else is invented:
   · design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t22.css → `.kw-msg__media` — the
     kit's only picture-shaped block. A ratio box on a paper tone at the card
     radius, with NO hairline and no glyph. That is the media well.
   · design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-patterns.css → `.kw-register` — what
     the kit shows when something is not there. The failure register's ink
     tiers and caption step are reused inside the frame.
   · components/primitives/skeleton/skeleton.tsx → `variant="media"` is
     `aspect-[16/9]` at `--radius`, so the skeleton this image replaces and
     the image itself occupy exactly the same box. That is why 16/9 is the
     default ratio here rather than a guess.
   Everything else this file needed is logged in GAPS-G.md (IMG-1 … IMG-5).

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · THE PICTURE FILLS THE BOX. `fit` defaults to `cover`, and that default is
     the client's ruling of 2026-09-09 — *"everywhere for images: do fill, not
     fit!"*, with a wide asset losing its ends named as the intended
     consequence. It was already the default before the ruling arrived, so
     nothing here moved on the day; what changed is that the default stopped
     being this file's preference and became `RULES.md` §4.4, checked by the
     `images` law. Anyone who "tidies" it to `contain` will now be told.
     `contain` REMAINS ON OFFER, and deliberately: the ruling is about what a
     picture does when nobody says otherwise, and §9.1 forbids dropping a
     variant value in any case. It is the only `contain` left in this
     repository, and it carries the one rot-checked entry in
     `foundations/rules/exemptions.json` that says so out loud.
   · A media box takes `--radius` (24). Not the pill, not the mark radius.
     There is no `shape` prop, because a second radius here would be a fifth
     radius in the system.
   · The placeholder ground is `--surface-quiet` — a real paper tone that
     flips with the palette. It is NEVER an opacity of the image or of the
     ink; an alpha of a token is a colour the palette does not contain.
   · Focus is the one global rule (tokens.css §8). Nothing here defines a
     ring; an <img> is not focusable and this file does not make it one.
   · `alt` is a PROP WITH A DEFAULT, like every other string. The apps run in
     Arabic, Urdu and Persian; an alt baked into a component is both an i18n
     bug and an accessibility one. The default is the empty string, which is
     the honest one: a component cannot describe a picture it has never seen,
     and "" is the correct, spec-defined value for decoration.
   · The native `loading="lazy"|"eager"` attribute is NOT this component's
     `loading` prop. House rule: a `loading` prop is a boolean. The native
     attribute is reached through `lazy`, which defaults to true.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. A broken image is one of the most common things a real
   application shows, so load and failure are tracked as state here rather
   than left to the call site — that is a hook and two event handlers.

/**

 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — the picture, `object-fit` per `fit`, on the quiet ground.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply. A picture is not a control. Where a call
 *                      site wraps one in a link or a button, that element owns
 *                      the hover; adding one here would make every avatar and
 *                      every thumbnail look clickable.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. An <img> is not focusable and this file does
 *                      not make it one. tokens.css §8 rings whatever wrapper a
 *                      call site makes focusable, at that wrapper's radius.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply, for the same reason as hover.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. A picture cannot be disabled. A picture
 *                      that may not be shown is the ERROR register, not a
 *                      greyed one, and greying it would be an opacity anyway.
 *  6. loading        — the quiet ground plus the spinner, `aria-busy` set. Held
 *                      until the browser reports the bytes decoded, or until a
 *                      passed `loading` goes false.
 *  7. empty          — no `src`: the quiet frame alone, holding its box. It
 *                      draws no icon, because an empty well is a resting state
 *                      and not a failure. `hideWhenEmpty` collapses it instead.
 *  8. error          — the failure register: `Warning` over `errorLabel`
 *                      in secondary ink on the quiet ground, `role="img"` with
 *                      the label as its accessible name so the failure is
 *                      announced once and not read as decoration.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. Selection belongs to whatever collection
 *                      holds the picture, and it draws the selection.
 * 10. read-only      — always. There is nothing here to write to.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED, and deliberately: the frame is
 *  `w-full` and takes its width from the parent at every width, with its height
 *  following from `ratio`. A media box that resized itself would stop matching
 *  the skeleton it replaces. Where a grid goes from one column to three, the
 *  grid is the composition's and the box follows it for free.
 *
 * RTL — safe. The frame names no side; the registers are centred; every inset
 * is logical. `object-fit` has no direction.
