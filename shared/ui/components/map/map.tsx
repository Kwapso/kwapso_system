/* ============================================================================
   Map — the plate, its pins and the list beside them (0 direct call sites).

   WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
   It is a FRAME plus the artifact's map VIEW, not a renderer. No mapping
   library is on the permitted dependency list and none is added, so this
   component does not draw tiles, markers or a projection. The plate arrives
   one of three ways: a `src` (a provider's embed URL, framed and sandboxed),
   `children` (the application's own renderer, handed the plate), or nothing
   at all — the muted plate the artifact draws, with the caller's own pins
   placed on it as percentages the application projected. Logged in full as
   GAPS-G.md MAP-1.

   DESIGN SOURCE — the artifact, 27.29 "Map", read in full
   · "The list is always beside it — A map is paired with the records in view,
     never shown alone. Pins are for orientation; the list is for reading,
     selecting and opening. Selecting in one marks the other."
   · "It says who is missing — Records without an address are counted in words
     under the list and remain reachable in the list view. A map that silently
     omits two accounts is a map that lies about the size of the business."
     The artifact's own line, verbatim, is the default: "Two accounts have no
     address and are not on the map. They are in the list view." — and because
     the count is data, it is a prop.
   · "Pins take the status accents — Sky, forest, poppy — the same three as
     every chart, with a paper capsule label on the ones that matter and bare
     dots for the rest. Never mango: a pin is a state, not the brand."
   · "The plate stays muted — A desaturated, low-contrast base with no
     saturated tiles, no satellite imagery and no coloured roads — the pins
     must be the only bright thing on it. Labels on the plate sit in paper
     capsules, never over raw map detail."
   · "Two controls only — Zoom in, zoom out, both round paper wells on the
     plate. No compass, no layer switcher, no fullscreen — and the map never
     takes the whole window: it stays inside the panel with the frame around
     it."
   · "Narrow demotes the map — Below 720px the plate becomes a 170px header
     strip and the list carries the screen." Both numbers are the artifact's.
   The box itself is the media well the kit does draw —
   design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t22.css → `.kw-msg__media`, shared
   with `image` through `imageVariants`.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · NO CSS `border`, anywhere, at any thinness. The plate had a hairline and
     the list rows had a black/grey border pair; both are gone. Separation is
     colour and fill, which is the only separation the brand allows.
   · SELECTION IS NOT A BORDER, AND IT IS NOT CHARCOAL EITHER. A selected row
     takes `--surface-selected` (override 44; it was `--surface-panel` under
     override 40, until the K1 reversal put that paper under the rows) — the
     SAME wash `TableRow` and `List` give a
     selected record, which is override 40's whole point: the system holds
     ONE answer for a selected record, not three. This row used to take
     chapter 10's on-state (`--surface-inverse` with `--ink-on-inverse`),
     which is the mark for a two-state CONTROL — a checkbox, a mode toggle, a
     day in the date grid — and not for a record in a list. A charcoal row in
     a list of accounts was the loudest thing on the screen and did not match
     the same account picked in a table two clicks away. Its pin still grows
     its paper capsule at the same moment, which is "selecting in one marks
     the other".
   · NO EMPTY-BOX DRAWING. The artifact forbids it in the same breath in
     27.28: "never a camera glyph, never a dashed box". The no-location and
     empty registers are TYPE — a sentence on the quiet ground — and the
     placeholder `Route` glyph that used to sit there is deleted.
   · Media boxes take `--radius` (24), and `overflow-hidden` clips whatever
     the provider paints to it.
   · Pins are `--info` (sky), `--success` (forest) and `--destructive`
     (poppy), plus a neutral. Never `--surface-brand`.
   · The registers sit on `--surface-quiet`. Never an opacity.
   · Every string is a prop with a default.
   · Focus is the one global rule. Nothing here defines a ring.

/**
 * Scripts, and nothing else. Stated as a constant so a reader can see what
 * "the default" is without reading the JSX. `allow-same-origin` is
 * deliberately absent — paired with `allow-scripts` it lets framed content
 * remove its own sandbox.
 *
 * IT USED TO BE `allow-scripts allow-same-origin`, AND THE ARGUMENT FOR THAT
 * ANSWERED ITS OWN QUESTION WRONG. The old comment here said, correctly, that
 * `web-embed` had dropped the pair on 2026-09-02 because a SAME-ORIGIN framed
 * document can reach `window.parent`, rewrite its own `sandbox` attribute and
 * reload itself out of the sandbox entirely — and then kept the pair anyway,
 * on the grounds that THIS component's `src` is a third party's embed URL by
 * definition. It then wrote down, in its own last paragraph, the reason that
 * is not good enough: **"it rests on `src` never being first-party, which
 * nothing in the type system enforces."**
 *
 * `src` is a `string`. A screen that pastes a URL a person typed, or an
 * application that frames its own map surface by URL rather than through
 * `children`, hands this component a first-party document while the type
 * checker nods along — and the pair is then no sandbox at all, on a prop
 * whose header still promises "framed and sandboxed". A default may not rest
 * on a convention the compiler cannot see; that is exactly the shape of
 * defect this component's sibling already corrected.
 *
 * THE COST OF CLOSING IT IS PAID BY THE PROVIDERS THAT ACTUALLY NEED IT, AND
 * THEY SAY SO BY NAME. A cross-origin provider — a Google or Mapbox embed —
 * was already in a different origin and was never reading ours, so an opaque
 * origin costs it nothing it had. A provider that genuinely needs its own
 * storage for tiles or preferences gets it by passing `allowSameOrigin`, one
 * greppable word at the call site, rather than by every map in the product
 * inheriting the loosest setting because one provider might want it.
 *
 * THIS IS NOW THE SAME ANSWER `web-embed` GIVES, DELIBERATELY. Two components
 * in one kit that both frame foreign content must not hold two different
 * opinions about what a sandbox is: a reader who learns the rule at one has
 * learned it at the other, and a security default that varies by component is
 * a default nobody can state.

 * The map view: a muted plate with status-accent pins, the records beside it,

 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — the muted plate with its pins, the list beside it on
 *                      desktop and under it on narrow, and the missing line
 *                      under the list.
 *  2. hover          — a list row takes `--accent`, the kit's neutral row
 *                      wash. A pin grows nothing: hovering a dot that is 9px
 *                      across is not an affordance, and the row beside it is.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings the rows, the pins and
 *                      the two zoom wells at their own radii.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply to the plate. A row's press resolves
 *                      into the selected state, which is louder than a nudge.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. A map that may not be interacted with
 *                      is a static picture, which is `Image`. GAPS-G.md MAP-3.
 *  6. loading        — "Loading map" on the quiet ground with the spinner,
 *                      `aria-busy` announced.
 *  7. empty          — no plate and no pins: the sentence, in type, on the
 *                      quiet ground. Never an icon, never a dashed box.
 *  8. error          — the sentence, announced once, with the one glyph the
 *                      kit does draw for a failure.
 *  9. selected       — `--surface-selected` on the row (override 44), and the pin
 *                      takes its paper capsule. No border, in either place.
 * 10. read-only      — always. This component never writes a location.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile   — the artifact's own rule: "Below 720px the plate becomes a 170px
 *             header strip and the list carries the screen." The plate loses
 *             its ratio and takes 170px; the zoom wells go, because "on
 *             narrow the map is a picture, not a tool".
 *  tablet   — from 720px the plate and the list sit side by side, the list at
 *             the artifact's fixed 250px column.
 *  desktop  — UNCHANGED from tablet.
 *
 * RTL — safe. The grid columns mirror, every inset is logical, and a pin is
 * placed with `insetInlineStart` so a projected x follows the reading
 * direction rather than a named side.
