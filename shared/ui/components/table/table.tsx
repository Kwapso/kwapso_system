   Table — rows and columns of record data (16 direct call sites).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/f3.css → `.kw-matrix`, the kit's own
   drawn table (chapter 07's state matrix). Every decision below is transcribed
   from it rather than taken from a shadcn default:
     · `border-collapse: collapse`, `width: 100%`, body type at `--text-body-s`.
     · `th` is a MICRO UPPERCASE eyebrow in tertiary ink at the 0.08em
       eyebrow tracking, aligned to the inline start, on a
       `--hair-strong` rule — the section-rule weight, because the header is a
       section boundary and not a same-tone split.
     · `td` sits on a `--hair` rule; `tr:last-child td` drops it.
     · `td:first-child` is `--weight-strong` and `white-space: nowrap` — the
       record's name column does not wrap.
     · `.kw-matrix-scroll { overflow-x: auto }` is the container, and the kit
       says in f3-gaps F3-3 that its `min-width` is "specimen chrome only —
       not kit law".
   design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-ui.css → `.kw-list__item:hover`, the
   neutral row wash, for the hover.
   motion/motion.css §7 → `.motion-row-hover`, `.motion-row-enter`,
   `.motion-row-exit`, `.motion-row-move`.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · THE ROW IS 56. `--control-height-row`, fixed. Ruling 28 lists the control
     heights as "32 dense · 38 field inside a row · 40 control · 44 touch row"
     and then keeps 56 for this one thing. It does not shrink at mobile, it
     does not grow at desktop, and a dense table is not a variant this file
     offers, because the ruling names one number. Register row 75 (`D14-KEEP`,
     2026-08-27) ratified all of this against CH17's own drawn density
     (header 13/18, rows 14/18, body 12.5) and CH19's 13.5 and 13: the
     client kept the primitive's figures and declined a `density` prop, so
     one table density exists and this file draws it.
   · A table's rules are the legitimate hairline, drawn as INSET SHADOWS and
     never as `border` properties (review 1A · fix 2). `--hair` between rows,
     `--hair-strong` under the header and above the footer. Never a hairline
     on a button or a coloured pill inside a cell — those keep their own law.
   · Row hover is `--accent`, the kit's neutral wash. NEVER `--primary`:
     mango is a brand fill, and a hovered table would otherwise go mango row
     by row.
   · Disabled is a fill and an ink, never an opacity. On a row that is
     `--btn-disabled-fill` / `--btn-disabled-label`, and the hover is dropped
     so a dead row cannot look clickable.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). Nothing here sets a ring, and
     the sticky header and the scroll container are built so they cannot hide
     one — see the two notes at `Table` and `TableHeader`.
   · No px, no hex, no font size. `text-micro`, `text-sm` and `text-caption`
     are real utilities (tokens.css §10) and each sets size, leading and
     tracking together.

   THE MOBILE ANSWER, STATED
   The table SCROLLS ON THE INLINE AXIS INSIDE ITS OWN CONTAINER. It does not
   restack into cards.

   Why, in three parts. (a) It is the kit's own answer: f3.css meets exactly
   this problem with `.kw-matrix-scroll { overflow-x: auto }` and scrolls.
   (b) A stacked card form breaks the one thing a table is for — comparing the
   same field down a column. Once every row is its own card, the reader can no
   longer scan a column, and the component has quietly changed what it does at
   a width rather than how it looks. (c) The row is 56 by ruling; a card stack
   has no 56-tall row in it, so the restack would have to abandon a stated
   number.
   The scroll needs the table to be wider than the viewport to engage, and the
   kit calls its own `min-width` specimen chrome, so this file imposes none and
   exposes `minWidth` instead (GAPS-D TBL-1). The two structural nudges the kit
   DOES state are kept: header cells and the first body cell never wrap, which
   is what makes a narrow table overflow rather than crush its name column.

   AND THE OTHER HALF OF THAT ANSWER, WHICH THIS FILE OWED AND DID NOT PAY —
   `sticky` ON A CELL, 2026-09-09
   The paragraph above ends a sentence early. A table that scrolls sideways has
   a second problem the moment it actually does: the column that says WHICH
   RECORD a row is leaves the viewport with everything else, and a reader
   scrolled fully to the end is looking at bands of values with nothing naming
   them. `TableHeader sticky` has always answered exactly this question on the
   BLOCK axis — pin the part that names the others — and there was no inline
   twin, so the answer stopped at one of the two axes a table can lose.

   THE CONSUMING APPLICATION FOUND THE MISSING HALF, and where it found it is
   the argument for the law rather than an anecdote. It drew the kit's own
   `PermissionMatrix` with the axes transposed — roles down the side, twenty-two
   modules across — which overflows at every width a person owns, and scrolled
   to the end the reader saw four bands of `S C E D` with no idea which one was
   Admin. The kit does not pin it because in the kit's own orientation the
   columns are roles and it never overflows. NOTHING ABOUT THAT IS THE APP'S
   BUSINESS: it is a table that can overflow, which is what this primitive is
   for, and the app could only have fixed it by writing `position: sticky`, a
   ground, a z-order, an inline-start inset and three row washes into a
   `className` on the kit's own cells — which is a kit bug wearing an app's
   diff (`docs/RULES.md` §13, and the client's "the kit is the only UI input").

   IT IS ONE PROP ON THE CELL, NOT A MODE ON THE TABLE. `sticky` on `TableHead`
   and on `TableCell` pins that cell to the inline start of the scroll
   container. A table with no scroll gets a cell that is `position: sticky` and
   never moves, which costs nothing; a table that pins its second column as
   well passes it twice with an inset the call site knows. The `Table` learns
   nothing and needs no prop, which is what keeps this out of the sixteen call
   sites that do not want it.

   THE GROUND IS THE WHOLE OF THE RISK AND IT IS THE SAME RISK `TableHeader`
   ALREADY TOOK. A pinned cell must be OPAQUE or the scrolled cells read
   straight through it, and the paper it paints is the paper the table is
   standing on — which this file cannot see. So it takes `--background`, the
   page paper, and a table dropped on a card or a panel passes
   `className="bg-card"` / `"bg-surface-panel"` on the cell, exactly as
   `TableHeader sticky` has said since it was written (GAPS-D TBL-2).

   AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT MATTERS HERE IS 1.000, WHICH IS THE POINT RATHER
   THAN THE BUG. Everywhere else in this kit two surfaces at 1.000 is the
   defect the contrast law hunts; a pinned column is the one place where the
   correct number against its own ground is exactly 1.000, because the column
   is a CONTINUATION of the paper and not a panel on top of it. The contrast
   law already says so in as many words — "an element that names the same token
   as its ground is a continuation, not a boundary" — and it says it about a
   sticky strip. What is a bug here is the OTHER shape: a pinned cell naming a
   paper the table is not standing on, which paints a pale band down the side
   of a grid at rest. That is why the paper is a call-site decision and why
   nothing here guesses it.

   THE ROW'S THREE WASHES ARE REPLAYED ON THE PINNED CELL, and they have to be.
   `TableRow` paints hover, selected and disabled on the `<tr>`; a cell with an
   opaque fill of its own covers all three, so a pinned name column would sit
   dead while the rest of its row lit up. The three are restated on the cell in
   MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE selectors — disabled, then selected-and-not-disabled,
   then hover-and-neither — which is `TableRow`'s own precedence
   (disabled > selected > default) written as CSS that cannot race. PATTERN §4
   forbids depending on Tailwind's emission order to break a tie; the `:not()`s
   are what make sure there is never a tie to break.

   THE HOVER WASH IS A SECOND LAYER RATHER THAN A SECOND COLOUR, and that is
   arithmetic, not taste. `--accent` is `rgba(26,25,24,.05)` — an alpha. An
   alpha written as this cell's `background-color` REPLACES the opaque paper
   instead of sitting on it, and the scrolled cells come back through the 95%
   that is left. So the paper stays the colour layer and the wash goes on the
   image layer, which paints above it: one element, two facts, and the wash
   composites over the paper exactly as it composites over the row. Selected
   and disabled are opaque tokens and need no such thing — they are a plain
   swap.

   WHAT A PINNED COLUMN DOES NOT GET, STATED RATHER THAN MISSED
   · NO EDGE. Chapter 13's subtitle is "Colour separates, strokes don't", and
     the pinned column is the paper rather than a panel on it — there is
     nothing for a rule to bound. There is also nowhere to draw one: the row's
     hairline is an inset shadow this file puts on the CELLS through
     `[&>*]:shadow-…`, which outranks any `shadow-` a cell writes on itself, so
     an edge here would have to be bought with a selector invented to beat the
     row. It is not, and this sentence is why.
   · NO SCROLL PADDING FOR IT. The container carries `scroll-p-1` so a focus
     ring in an off-screen column is brought fully into view. Tabbing BACKWARDS
     into a control that is off-screen at the inline START still brings it to
     the container's edge, which is under the pinned column. A scrollport
     cannot measure what is pinned to it, so no number is invented here; a call
     site that knows its own name column's width may pass
     `containerProps`/`containerClassName` a `scroll-ps-*`. Logged, not guessed
     (§11.1).
   · AND NO COVER FROM THE CONTRAST LAW, WHICH IS THE ONE THAT HAD TO BE
     PROVED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. The pinned paper was written, and then a
     PROBE put the wrong one under it — `bg-background` on a
     `--surface-raised` ground, two different names resolving to one colour,
     1.000 in light, the exact bug shape `check-contrast.mjs` exists to catch.
     The run came back GREEN. Two more arrangements were tried and came back
     green as well: the ground on the demo's `Panel`, and the ground on a bare
     `<div>` wrapping the table. The reason is structural rather than a
     misspelling — a pinned cell's fill sits behind `Table` → `TableHeader` →
     `TableRow` → `TableCell`, and the ground walker does not carry a call
     site's paper through that many component boundaries. (One thing the probe
     DID fix on the way: `permission-matrix.tsx`'s paper was an object literal
     indexed inside a render, a shape the walker cannot read at all; it is a
     module-level table now, which is the `COLUMN_DOT[dot]` form the check
     states it reads.)
     SO THE NUMBERS ARE MEASURED HERE INSTEAD, off the same token model the
     law uses, and confirmed against the browser's own computed styles:
         pinned paper vs its own ground, named correctly   1.000 / 1.000
         the guess — page paper on a panel ground          1.103 / 1.079
         the guess — page paper on a card ground           1.000 / 1.198
         selected wash on the pin vs a panel ground        1.103 / 1.111
         disabled wash on the pin vs a panel ground        1.214 / 1.252
         hover wash over the pin, vs the paper             1.103 / 1.143
         the row's name on the pinned paper                15.763 / 17.056
     The hover line is the one worth reading twice: `--accent` over the pinned
     paper composites to #ECE7E0 light and #272623 dark, which are the SAME
     two hexes the row's own wash makes over the same ground. The pin does not
     approximate the row; it repeats it.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   No `"use client"`. Every part forwards props and refs; the one piece of
   logic (the row's exclusive state) is a plain expression, not a hook. These
   render inside a Server Component unchanged.

 *  1. default        — 56 tall, on a `--hair` hairline.

 *                      `.motion-row-hover` timing it. Only on a row that is
 *                      neither selected nor disabled — the precedence above is
 *                      resolved in JS, so there is no race to lose.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once. A
 *                      `<tr>` is not focusable; the controls inside it are.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply. A row is not a button. Where a whole
 *                      row navigates, the call site puts a `Button
 *                      variant="link"` in the first cell and that control owns
 *                      the press (GAPS-D TBL-5).
 *  5. disabled       — `--btn-disabled-fill` / `--btn-disabled-label`,
 *                      `aria-disabled`, no hover.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply to a row. A row waiting for its own data
 *                      renders `Skeleton` in its cells and keeps its 56.
 *  7. empty          — a row with no cells renders an empty 56-tall row.
 *                      Nothing is invented; the empty register belongs to the
 *                      collection.
 *  8. error          — does not apply as a skin. A row whose record failed
 *                      says so in a cell, with a `Badge variant="destructive"`
 *                      — colour is the whole treatment and it belongs on the
 *                      pill, not smeared across the row.
 *  9. selected       — `bg-surface-selected` and `data-state="selected"`.
 * 10. read-only      — always, for this primitive.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED, and this is the load-bearing one:
 *  56 at every width, by ruling 28. The row does not become 44 on a phone and
 *  it does not become dense on a wide screen.
 *
 * RTL — safe. Height and rules are on the block axis; the cells inside are
 * logical.
