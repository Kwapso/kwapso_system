/* ============================================================================
   Swimlane — the board split into rows.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   CH19 view 08 — the kit's own HTML, which is the authority the client's
   re-audit points at (2026-08-26, "reference to the pdf"). The chapter's
   template holes name every part of it and nothing else:

       {{ lane.label }} · {{ lane.count }} · {{ card.stage }} · {{ card.title }}

   and the drawn block is:

       lane head — `display: flex; gap: 10px; padding: 4px 6px 8px`: the
         label at 12/500 uppercase 0.08em, the count at 11 tabular `--fg3`,
         then a 1px RULE flexing from the count to the panel's far edge;
       cards — `grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); gap: 10px`, each card
         `--card` at radius 24, `padding: 11px 13px`, carrying its stage as a
         10/500 uppercase eyebrow INSIDE the card, then the 13 title.

   THERE IS NO LANE-LABEL COLUMN AND NO SHARED HEAD ROW OF STAGE NAMES. The
   `130px repeat(3, 1fr)` ladder this file used to transcribe was
   `KWAPSO-SPEC.md`'s older extract reading view 22 (compare) — GAPS-KIT-DE
   L19-4 traced it against the rendered page and the L-8 audit before it. The
   wide arrangement below is now the chapter's own: the narrow arrangement,
   promoted to every width. `labelWidth` is accepted and INERT — there is no
   label column for it to size — kept so no call site breaks.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · A SWIMLANE IS A BOARD SPLIT INTO ROWS, AND THE BOARD IS `Kanban`'S. What
     is shared with it is stated rather than copied: the CELL is `Card`, the
     count is a QUIET 11 TABULAR NUMBER and not a `Badge`, and the lane has
     NO ground at all — both of those moved with `kanban`'s, for the same
     two reasons (GAPS-FIDELITY-DE L-17 and L-18). What is NOT
     shared is drag — `Kanban` owns every drag moment and the kit draws none
     for a swimlane, so this view opens cards and does not move them. A caller
     that needs to move a card uses `Kanban`. GAPS-TRACK2A SWL-1.
   · EVERY LANE NAMES ITSELF AND EVERY CARD NAMES ITS STAGE. The chapter
     draws no shared head row: the stage word is the card's own eyebrow, so a
     card is legible wherever it stands and nothing has to stay in register
     across lanes.
   · Hover belongs to the card, which takes `Card interactive`'s `--accent`
     wash and `.motion-hover-lift`. A LANE does not hover: it is a band.
   · Disabled is a fill and an ink (`--btn-disabled-fill` /
     `--btn-disabled-label`), never an opacity.
   · Radii: 24 on the card. The lane has none — it has no fill to round —
     and the count is a bare number, so it has none either.
   · No `border` property. Focus is one global rule (tokens.css §8), and
     nothing here sets `overflow: hidden` on a lane or a card.
   · Colour is separation (law 3): the card is `--card` and the ground it
     stands on is the FRAME's soft paper, so a card is never the tone of the
     surface under it. The lane itself paints nothing — see the note on the
     lane element for why it used to.
   · Never mango. rem only. Every string a prop with a default. LTR only.

   A NOTE ON THE TWO LADDERS
   The template a grid takes has to change at a breakpoint, and an inline
   `style` beats every class including one inside a media query. So the two
   templates are carried as custom properties and the BREAKPOINT SWAPS THE
   VARIABLE, in a class, where a media query can reach it. Written down
   because it looks like indirection and is in fact the only way round the
   cascade.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. A pressable card means a handler is built during this
   module's own render, and `Card` reacts to the pointer.

   THE COUNT — a quiet number, not a pill.

   CH19 view 08 draws both counts, the stage's and the lane's, as
   `font-size: 11px; color: var(--fg3); font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.
   CH14 states the same rule in words on the folder strip, which draws the
   identical object: "counts are quiet, never badges."

   This was `<Badge count>`, whose quiet variant is a `--surface-quiet` pill
   at 12/500 — a drawing the chapter never makes. The two laws the badge WAS
   carrying are kept here rather than lost with the pill: a count renders
   EMPTY at zero and never "0", and a count still in flight renders nothing
   rather than a placeholder zero.

   `text-micro` is the ladder's 11 rung and drags the eyebrow's 0.08em, which
   a number is not, so the tracking is reset — the same pair `gantt`'s period
   head and `kanban`'s card meta already use. GAPS-FIDELITY-DE L-18.

/**
 * A board of stages, split into a row per lane.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — the stage names, then a lane per record group. A lane
 *                      is a label and its cards, bare on the frame's paper;
 *                      it is not a band.
 *  2. hover          — the CARD's, via `Card interactive`: the `--accent` wash
 *                      and `.motion-hover-lift`. Never mango, never an
 *                      opacity. A lane does not hover.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once, at
 *                      the card's own 24. Nothing in this file clips a ring;
 *                      the lane's scroll container carries `scroll-p-1` so a
 *                      ring at the edge is brought in whole.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply as a skin. Pressing a card opens the
 *                      record, and the acknowledgement is the record arriving.
 *  5. disabled       — per card: `--btn-disabled-fill` /
 *                      `--btn-disabled-label`, `aria-disabled`, no hover and
 *                      no tab stop that does nothing. A fill and an ink.
 *  6. loading        — `loading`: the heads and the lane labels STAY and the
 *                      cells fill with `Skeleton` cards, so nothing moves when
 *                      the records land. The lane count is known from the
 *                      props; only the cards are not.
 *  7. empty          — two kinds. An empty CELL draws nothing at all: a stage
 *                      a lane has no work in is a normal reading of the grid,
 *                      and a register in every hole would be noise. An empty
 *                      LANE says so once across its whole width. No lanes at
 *                      all draws the register in place of the view.
 *  8. error          — `error`: the register with a poppy dot. Beats empty.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. The kit draws no selected card
 *                      (GAPS-F CRD-3) and a swimlane may not invent one.
 * 10. read-only      — without `onCardSelect` the whole view is read-only and
 *                      still reads completely.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS — ONE ARRANGEMENT (L19-4). The chapter's drawing holds at
 * every width: the lane's own head row (label · count · rule), then the stage
 * cells with the stage word inside each card. Only the grid changes:
 *  · mobile (base, to 45rem) — the stage columns SCROLL ON THE INLINE AXIS
 *    with scroll-snap, one column per stop, following `Kanban`'s own stated
 *    law ("a board that wraps is not a board") because chapter 19 states no
 *    narrow render for view 08. Logged as GAPS-TRACK2A SWL-2.
 *  · tablet (`min-[45rem]:`) — the chapter's `repeat(n, 1fr)`: equal stage
 *    columns, no scrolling, no label column and no shared head.
 *  · desktop — unchanged in kind; more width goes to the stage columns.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only (ruling 10). Every inset is logical and no rule names a side.
