/* ============================================================================
   Tabs — peers, switched between (21 direct call sites).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   ONE VARIANT, `line` — design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-ui.css → `.kw-tabs`
   / `.kw-tab`: a row on a `--hair` rule, `--space-6` apart, each tab
   `--space-3` block padding with a 2px transparent block-end border pulled
   back over the rule by one hairline. Tertiary ink, going to primary ink on
   hover; the selected tab is primary ink at 500 with the border in
   `--ink-primary`.
   motion/motion.css §8 → `.motion-tab-indicator`, `.motion-tab-trigger`,
   `.motion-tab-panel-in`.

   `folder` IS GONE — CLIENT RULING, 2026-09-02, v1.2.28.
   "the whole concept of folders as tabs gets killed. All the current folders
   as tabs we have will become line tabs. Completely kill and remove folder
   tabs… I don't want any dead body around… the only tabs that we will have
   are the line tabs because folders will only be used for the breadcrumbs."

   READ THIS BEFORE RESTORING ANYTHING FROM THE HISTORY OF THIS FILE. What was
   retired is the tab VARIANT, not the brand silhouette. `folder/folder.tsx` is
   untouched, `FolderShape` is unchanged control point for control point, and
   its `lip` crop has exactly one consumer now:
   `components/breadcrumbs/breadcrumb-folders.tsx`, the breadcrumb drawn as a
   folder strip. Everything this file used to hold about the folder tab — the
   47.5 height, the `--space-1` seam, the `--folder-tab-overlap` pull, the
   13/300 label, the two papers and their whole TAB-C1 register history — moved
   there verbatim rather than being deleted, and that file is where it is
   maintained. `--folder-tab-overlap` and its sibling tokens did NOT go with
   the variant; the breadcrumb reads them.

   THE `pill` PRECEDENT, RESTATED BECAUSE IT NOW APPLIES TWICE. Review round 1
   deleted a third variant that was a segmented CONTROL (t10.css
   `.kw-seg__btn`) wearing a tab's name; it still exists as `toggle-group` and
   `mode-toggle`. `TabsVariant` was made a closed union then so a call site
   writing `variant="pill"` would fail to compile rather than drift. It is a
   ONE-member union now, for the same reason and against `"folder"`.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · A tab is a real button and takes the global ring like every other control.
     Nothing here sets `outline: none`.
   · HOVER IS A WEIGHT MOVE ONLY, NOT AN INK MOVE. REVERSED 2026-09-03. The
     kit's own `.kw-tab` and this file's hover both used to move ink
     (`--ink-secondary` -> `--foreground`) alongside the weight step added the
     same day the folder variant retired; the client then asked for the
     rail's own rule instead — verbatim, "when i hover over a tab i want that
     it gets the same weight as the active tab (without changing the color)
     replicate the behaviour we already have in navbar." `rail.tsx`'s
     `ROW_IDLE` is exactly that: a fixed ink at every state, and only the
     weight steps up on hover, "because adding a fill [or moving the ink]
     would make an idle row look half-selected." So the ink hover is deleted
     here, not softened — resting ink stays `--ink-secondary` through hover,
     and only the weight below previews the active state.
   · Disabled is an ink (`--btn-disabled-label`) and a cursor, never an
     opacity, and the hover is suppressed so a dead tab never looks live. There
     is no disabled FILL any more: a line tab has no resting box to fill, and
     filling one would invent a shape the kit does not draw. The fill half of
     that pair belonged to the folder silhouette and left with it.
   · Only four radii exist, and a tab claims none of them: `line` is a rule
     under type.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). No ring here, no `outline: none`
     anywhere, and the negative hairline margin is small enough that the ring
     still clears the rule.
   · No transition or keyframe is written here. `.motion-tab-trigger` (colour),
     `.motion-tab-indicator` (transform + width, on `--ease-move`, because the
     indicator is the one element the eye tracks continuously) and
     `.motion-tab-panel-in` (the tight rise on the incoming panel only — tabs
     are peers, not a filmstrip) already exist and are attached.

   THE INDICATOR, AND WHY IT IS MEASURED
   motion.css §8 states outright that "the indicator's own geometry is set by
   the component (a measured transform and width, or a grid column). This file
   times it." Tabs are not equal-width in either specimen, so the grid-column
   route cannot express them and the geometry is measured.

   The measurement is a px number read off the live layout and written back as
   a px transform. That is NOT a design value and does not breach commission
   rule 5: it is the position the browser has already computed at the current
   text scale, so it rescales with everything else by construction. No size,
   colour or spacing in this file is a px.

   Before the first measurement — server render, and the frame before
   hydration — the ACTIVE TRIGGER draws its own mark (its border, its fill).
   `TabsList` then publishes `indicator: true` through context and the
   triggers drop their own mark in the same commit the indicator appears in,
   so the two are never both painted and the mark is never missing.

   The variant, and why a one-member union is still worth typing.

   It carries nothing at runtime any more — there is one skin, so nothing is
   chosen and nothing has to be handed down the tree. What it does is FAIL A
   BUILD: a call site that still writes `variant="folder"` (or `"pill"`) does

 * THE GAP BETWEEN A SCREEN-LEVEL LINE-TAB STRIP AND WHATEVER STANDS DIRECTLY

 * live product: "there needs to be space between the tabs and the start of
 * the container … the spacing between the tabs and the beginning of the
 * content is incorrect on main screens … go and uniform that, and make sure
 * that you don't hard-code page by page, but rather you change the rule and
 * you apply it everywhere."
 *
 * THE NUMBER IS NOT A GUESS. It is read off the one join that already drew it
 * correctly — a record's own tab strip in the live product spends exactly
 * `--space-5` (20) between the strip and the card, in a token named
 * `--record-tab-gap` and commented, verbatim, as "the blank page-tone space
 * the client asked for … a real token rather than a guess". `CollectionFrame`
 * independently lands on the same number at its own default density (see its
 * header, "the frame's stack takes its ordinary band gap"). This constant is
 * that one number, named once, so every kit composition that draws a
 * screen-level strip reads it rather than re-deriving its own.
 *
 * IT IS PADDING ON THE STRIP'S OWN BOX, NOT A FLEX `gap` — REWRITTEN
 * 2026-09-03, SAME DAY, SECOND RULING. Her words: "make sure to maintain the
 * space between tabs and content on all screens, even when I scroll down." A
 * `gap` between two flex siblings is a LAYOUT-TIME measurement: it is real
 * while both siblings sit in their static position, and it evaporates the
 * moment one of them goes `position: sticky` and freezes at the top of a
 * scrolling pane while the other keeps scrolling underneath it — the two
 * boxes are no longer a fixed distance apart, so the "gap" that used to
 * separate them stops meaning anything and the content slides up flush
 * against the pinned strip. Padding on the STRIP'S OWN wrapper does not have
 * this failure mode: it is part of the box that gets pinned, so it travels
 * with the strip and the trailing space survives exactly where a `gap` could
 * not — at rest, scrolled with the strip in flow, and scrolled with the strip
 * sticky. THE STRIP OWNS THIS PROPERTY, NOT THE SHELL: `ScreenShell` draws no
 * tab strip of either kind (see its own header, "TABS — SPENT"), so a shell
 * that does not draw a strip cannot be the thing that reserves room under
 * one.
 *
 * APPLY IT TO A WRAPPER AROUND `TabsList`, NEVER TO `TabsList` ITSELF.
 * `LIST_SKIN`'s own hairline (`shadow-[inset_0_-0.0625rem_0_var(--border)]`)
 * is anchored to `TabsList`'s OWN bottom edge, directly under the tab row;
 * padding added to `TabsList` would push that rule down WITH it, into the
 * middle of the gap, which reads as a stray line floating in blank space
 * rather than the strip's own underline. A caller that needs the strip to
 * pin also owns `position: sticky` / `top-0` / an opaque background on that
 * SAME wrapper — see `RecordDetail`'s own `strip`, which does both — so the
 * one box that gets pinned is the one that reserves the trailing space,
 * always.
 *
 * NOT THE BASE DEFAULT BELOW. `Tabs`'s own unlabelled `gap-4` stays the
 * answer for every OTHER pairing of a strip and its content — a dialog, a
 * card, a settings page — where nothing has ruled a wider air and nothing
 * pins on scroll; this constant is reached FOR, by the screen-level
 * compositions the ruling is actually about, rather than pushed underneath
 * every caller that never asked for it.

 *                      dead shows no content at all and is a screen the
 *                      composition should not have rendered.

 *                      not arrived renders a `Skeleton` inside its own
 *                      `TabsContent`; swapping the strip for a placeholder

 *                      list instead.
 *  8. error          — does not apply. A tab set reports nothing; a panel that
 *                      failed renders its own `Alert`.
 *  9. selected       — the whole point of the component. Radix owns it via

 *  (`overflow-x-auto`, triggers `whitespace-nowrap`) rather than wrapping to a
 *  second line. This is the kit's own answer to content wider than the
 *  viewport — `.kw-matrix-scroll` in _fragments/f3.css scrolls the wide table
 *  instead of restacking it. A tab strip that wrapped would move every tab
 *  under the reader's finger the moment one label got longer, and a two-line
 *  strip no longer reads as one row of peers. `scrollbar-width: none` hides
 *  the OS bar because the strip is short enough to be dragged and a bar under
 *  a 2px rule reads as a second rule.
 *
 *  `overflow-y-hidden` ADDED, 17 SEP 2026 EVENING — the client, on the live
 *  product: "sometimes there is a vertical scroll on the tabs under the
 *  title. It should not be like that." Setting `overflow-x` alone computes
 *  `overflow-y: auto` by the CSS spec's own default, and a strip whose
 *  `scrollHeight` rounds up 1px past its `clientHeight` (measured live on
 *  staging, every `[role=tablist]`) became vertically scrollable on that
 *  1px — invisible with the scrollbar hidden (below), but still real
 *  scrolling, which is what she felt rather than saw. This axis was never
 *  meant to move; `overflow-y-hidden` says so instead of leaving it to a
 *  sub-pixel rounding accident. See `foundations/rules/check-overflow-
 *  axis.mjs` for the kit-wide check this ruling also added.
 *  Focus survives it: nothing sets `overflow: hidden`, and `scroll-p-2`
 *  (0.5rem) is more than the ring's 2px offset + 2px width, so tabbing across
 *  a scrolled strip brings each tab into view ring and all.

/**
 * One tab.
 *
 * A count rides along as a child, not as an API: `TabsCount` (below) is the
 * shaped number, so a call site never hand-rolls the count's markup and the
 * two cannot drift apart. Its shape is GAPS-RULINGS.md R-4a's ruling, THE
 * CIRCLE CLAUSE REVERSED 2026-09-03: quiet tertiary text at rest, and on the
 * ACTIVE tab only, the same round mango fill the title's own count wears —
 * `Badge`'s counter geometry, not a forced circle — with primary-ink text.
 * See `TabsCount` for the shape itself.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — secondary ink over the strip's own rule.
 *  2. hover          — WEIGHT ONLY, as of 2026-09-03: a preview of the active
 *                      weight, `--font-weight-medium`. No ink move, no fill
 *                      change, no opacity — the resting `--ink-secondary`
 *                      holds through hover exactly as it holds through the
 *                      rest of the strip. Guarded with `enabled:` so a
 *                      disabled tab never matches the rule.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *  4. active/pressed — no nudge and no third tone. A tab's press resolves
 *                      instantly into the selected state, which is a far
 *                      louder acknowledgement than a 1px drop; the kit draws
 *                      no pressed tab (GAPS-D TAB-3).
 *  5. disabled       — `--btn-disabled-label` and `cursor-not-allowed`. An ink
 *                      and a cursor, emitted after the skin so tailwind-merge
 *                      drops the loser rather than leaving two
 *                      same-specificity rules to race. No FILL: a line tab has
 *                      no resting box, and inventing one to grey it out would
 *                      be drawing a shape the kit does not have.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply to a tab. The panel loads, not its label.
 *  7. empty          — an unlabelled tab renders an empty control. Nothing is
 *                      invented; a tab with no name is a call-site bug.
 *  8. error          — does not apply. A tab that leads to a failing panel is
 *                      still a working tab; the panel reports its own failure.
 *                      A count of problems is a `Badge` passed as a child.
 *  9. selected       — `data-state="active"`. Drawn by the strip's indicator
 *                      when it has measured, and by the trigger's own inset
 *                      2px rule when it has not, so the mark exists on the
 *                      server render too.
 * 10. read-only      — does not apply.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED. The tab never wraps and never
 *  truncates; the strip scrolls instead. A tab that shrank would stop matching
 *  its neighbours, and a truncated tab label is a tab you cannot choose.
 *
 * RTL — safe. `px-*` is padding-inline, `-mb-px` is on the block axis, and the
 * icon slot is ordered by `gap` rather than by side.

/* ============================================================================
   TabsCount

   THE 2026-08-31/09-01 CLIENT RULING — recorded in full at GAPS-RULINGS.md
   R-4a. Read that entry before touching the block below: it is a NEW decision
   that changes what CH27's "underline strip with a quiet count" meant in
   practice, and it is not a taste call to soften back to symmetric.

   THE SECOND HALF OF R-4a LEFT WITH THE FOLDER VARIANT (2026-09-02). It was
   ch14's own law — "counts are quiet, never badges", micro/tabular/tertiary,
   no shape, active or not, because a folder tab already said "selected" with
   its own fill and rise. Nothing in the kit draws a count on a breadcrumb
   crumb, so it did not move to `breadcrumbs/breadcrumb-folders.tsx` with the
   rest of the skin; it is recorded here and is not reachable.

   THE CIRCLE CLAUSE REVERSED, 2026-09-03. R-4a's active shape used to be read
   as "completely round" and drawn `size-[1.125rem]` — a fixed square forced
   into a perfect circle by `rounded-pill`, so a two-digit count clipped
   against its own fixed width instead of growing. The client's own words,
   read again after she flagged it: "the circle is not correct, but rather a
   round shape like you have on the title when they have a count… it was a
   mistake to change it." The reference was never a geometric circle at
   all — it was `Badge`'s own COUNTER geometry (`badge.tsx`, `size="counter"`:
   `h-5 min-w-5 px-2`, `rounded-pill`), the exact shape the collection
   heading's own count chip wears via `CollectionFrame`'s `countChip`
   (`Badge count={count} …`). A fixed-circle reading of "completely round" was
   the mistake; "round-ended and lets a wide number grow" was always the
   ruling, and it is what ships below.
   ========================================================================= */

/* R-4a, THE CIRCLE CLAUSE AS CORRECTED 2026-09-03. At rest: bare `text-badge`
   (12 — "badge, count and status text", KWAPSO-SPEC ch07/ch26) in tertiary
   ink, no shape at all — never a pill, never a stroke, matching the inactive
   half of the ruling exactly (untouched by today's fix).
   On the tab THIS count lives in going active — read off `group/tab`'s own
   `data-state`, the same attribute the strip's indicator measures off, so no
   JS branch is needed here — the number takes `Badge`'s own counter box,
   `h-5 min-w-5 px-2` (`badge.tsx`, `size="counter"`), not a fixed `size-*`
   square: a round-ended pill that STARTS at the same 20-tall/20-wide minimum
   a one-digit count draws and grows on its inline axis past that minimum for
   two and three digits, exactly as `Badge` itself does at every other count
   in the kit. `rounded-pill` is unchanged — it was never the bug; pairing it
   with a fixed `size-*` instead of a `min-w-*` was. Mango fill and
   primary-ink (`--primary-foreground`, already charcoal) text are also
   unchanged: her correction was the SHAPE, not the colour. The type size does
   not change between the two states — "colour is the only difference" is
   ch14's phrase for the tab itself, and it is kept here for the count too, so
   a count never reflows the label beside it when its own tab is selected.

   THIS IS `badge.tsx`'s OWN COUNTER GEOMETRY, NOT AN APPROXIMATION OF IT. The
   four size classes below (`h-5 min-w-5 px-2` plus `rounded-pill`) are the
   literal tokens `badgeVariants({ variant: "default", size: "counter" })`
   resolves to — verified by calling it — so a change to that size step
   changes both places to check by eye, but the values are not free to drift:
   `verify/tab-joint/page.tsx`'s `5_count_shape` case reads both elements'
   computed height, width, radius and inline padding side by side and fails
   the moment the GEOMETRY disagrees at any of one, two or three digits
   (background and text colour are read too, but are not expected to match —
   the mango fill is a separate, deliberate half of this same ruling). A
   literal `<Badge>` is not
   substituted here because the active shape has to key off `group/tab`'s own
   `data-state` with no JS branch (this file's `TRIGGER_BASE` comment, and
   R-4a above) — `Badge` has no such CSS-only "am I inside the active tab"
   switch, and Tailwind's own build needs each utility written out as a
   literal token in source rather than assembled at runtime, so the geometry
   is restated here rather than imported as a class string. */
