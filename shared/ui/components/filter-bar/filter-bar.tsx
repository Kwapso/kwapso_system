   DESIGN SOURCE
   · design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t11.css → `.kw-chip`,
     `.kw-chip__x`, `.kw-chip--add`, read alongside t11-chips.html. This is
     the core reference: an active facet is a KIT-DRAWN CHIP — badge type,
     `--space-3` of inline-start padding and `--space-1` at the inline end,
     with an 18 circle on the `--hair` fill as its remove control. The pill's
     OWN height and fill were brought to `--control-height-button` /
     `--btn-secondary-fill` by client ruling 2026-09-02 — see `CHIP_ADD`'s own
     header — so this chapter's 26-tall raised pill is carried for the
     padding and the remove-control drawing only, not for the height or the
     fill. "Clear filters" reuses that same chip drawing. "+ Filter" NO
     LONGER DOES: under the second half of the same ruling it took
     `SelectTrigger`'s inline padding, type step and weight, and it is now
     the one control in this file drawn as a toolbar pill rather than as a
     chip. `CHIP_ADD`'s own header carries the four measures and the reason.
   · design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t11-gaps.md → T11-4 records that
     the chip's end padding is unstated and that `--space-1` was the choice.
     Carried, not re-decided.
   · design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t21.css + t21-empty.html +
     t21-gaps.md → the registers. A facet whose list came back with nothing is
     the kit's "no results" register: a line saying what happened, in the
     caption step on secondary ink. T21-2 is why the failure line is authored
     rather than quoted.
   · design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t9.css → `.kw-search` for the
     facet's own search pill, and the chapter-9 field skin for the range
     fields.
   · components/select/select.tsx and dropdown-menu — an option row in this
     system is `rounded-pill px-3 py-[var(--space-2h)]` on `--accent`. Matched
     rather than re-drawn. `select.tsx` is also this file's source for two
     things it does not draw itself: `CHIP_ADD`'s toolbar measures and
     `CompactFacet`'s closed field, both of which take
     `selectTriggerVariants` rather than a copy of its numbers.
   · components/popover/popover.tsx — chapter 12's floating surface, which is
     what `CompactFacet` opens. This file draws no surface of its own.
   Everything left open is in GAPS-G.md (FLT-1 … FLT-7).

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · Chips and facet pills take `--radius-pill`. Marks take `--radius-select`
     (6). Nothing here takes a fifth radius. `CompactFacet`'s open panel is at
     `--radius` (24) and is not an exception to that: it is not a control, it
     is chapter 12's floating SURFACE, and the radius is `PopoverContent`'s
     own — this file does not name it.
   · A chip here is NEUTRAL — `--btn-secondary-fill`, the same paper
     `ViewSwitch` and `SortControl`'s field stand on, and `--btn-secondary-
     label` ink — so it may carry nothing coloured. Ruling 26 forbids an edge
     on a coloured pill; these are not coloured, and they still carry none.
   · Mango appears nowhere in this file. A selected facet is not a brand fill,
     and the neutral hover is `--accent`.
   · A REMOVABLE CHIP HAS TWO FOCUS TARGETS. When a chip is selectable the
     label is its own button and the remove control is a second one, side by
     side inside one pill, and both are in the tab order. Nesting the remove
     control inside a chip-wide button would make one of them unreachable,
     which is why the pill is a container and not a button.
   · Focus is the one global rule (tokens.css §8). Nothing here defines a ring
     and nothing sets `outline: none`.
   · Disabled is a fill and an ink; the read-only field loses its edge, per
     chapter 9. Neither is ever an opacity.
   · Every string is a prop with a default — "Clear filters", "Remove filter",
     "From", "To", "Search", the empty line and the failure line.

   MOBILE — THE STATED ANSWER, NOT "UNCHANGED"
   Below `sm` (40rem) the chip row does NOT wrap and does NOT go into a sheet.
   It becomes a single-row horizontal SCROLLER (`flex-nowrap overflow-x-auto`),
   and from `sm` up it wraps as a normal flex row. Reasoning, because this is a
   real decision and not a default: active filters are the reader's own recent
   actions and every one of them must stay both visible and removable. Wrapping
   four chips on a 360-wide phone pushes the content that is being filtered
   below the fold; a sheet hides the filters behind a control and needs an
   overlay this primitive does not own — and the moment they are hidden, people
   forget they are on and read a filtered list as an empty one. A scroller keeps
   every chip one swipe away, keeps both focus targets per chip reachable by
   keyboard, and costs no chrome. GAPS-G.md FLT-1.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. Three of the four components hold state and all four attach
   handlers; `CompactFacet` additionally renders Radix Popover, which is a
   client component in its own right.

/* `.kw-chip--add` — the "+ filter" slot.

   FLT-C1. CH11 draws this chip in its "Filter chips — removable" block, at the
   end of the applied row, and the build had no slot for it at all: the only
   thing rendered after the chips was `Clear`, wearing a comment that named
   `.kw-chip--add` for a control that is not it.

   THE DASH IS GONE — CLIENT RULING, 2026-09-02, OVERRIDING ch26. This used to
   be "the one bordered control in the system": a dashed `1px dashed
   var(--hair-strong)` outline at the shorter `--control-height-pill`, on the
   ch26 reading that a dash signals "not yet set" for an empty filter slot.
   The client's own words this round: "all the components in toolbar (the
   sort, the filter, the view) i want them in the same pill aspect exactly.
   match filter and sort to the existing view selector component (i am happy
   with how that is)" — verbatim, and explicit that Filter is to match View
   "full stop", dashed idle affordance included. CH11 itself never drew this
   chip with an edge in any of its 88 declarations (recorded honestly above,
   before this ruling, for the reader checking); ch26 is the only source for
   the dash, and this ruling is the client overriding it. What stands now is
   `ViewSwitch`'s own drawing: `--control-height-button` (40) tall,
   `--btn-secondary-fill` solid, no hairline, `--btn-secondary-hover` on
   hover, `--btn-secondary-label` ink — the same pill `SortControl`'s field
   wears.

   AND THE FOUR THAT WERE MISSED — SAME RULING, SETTLED 2026-09-02 ON
   STAGING. The client's words the second time, verbatim: "the filter
   button-pill it's still differnet than the other 2. fix and uniform it".
   The pass above moved four properties (height, fill, label ink, hover) and
   stopped; the reader in front of the toolbar could still tell the three
   pills apart. Measured off this file and `select.tsx`, what was left:

       inline padding   12 (`px-3`)            →  18 (`--space-4h`)
       type step        12 (`--text-badge`)    →  14 (`--text-sm`)
       leading          1  (`leading-none`)    →  1.45 (`--text-sm`'s own)
       weight           inherited (300 / 400)  →  500 (`--font-weight-medium`)

   The first two and the leading are `selectTriggerVariants`' own base line —
   `px-[var(--space-4h)]`, `text-sm` — which is what `SortControl`'s field and
   `ViewSwitch` are both drawn through; the weight is the one property
   `ViewSwitch` overrides that trigger with, and it is taken from there for
   the same reason the height was.

   `leading-none` IS REMOVED RATHER THAN RESTATED AS 1.45. `text-sm` already
   carries `--text-sm--line-height`, and the `leading-none` sitting on top of
   it was the whole reason this pill's string was set solid where the other
   two were not. Naming the leading again would be a second copy of a number
   the type step already owns.

   THIS IS NOW THE ONE PILL IN THIS FILE THAT IS NOT BADGE TYPE, and that is
   a decision, not an oversight left behind. `filterChipVariants` — a
   removable facet chip, and the "Clear filters" control that shares its
   drawing — STAYS at `--text-badge` with `px-3`: those are CH11's `.kw-chip`,
   drawn at badge type in the fragment cited at the top of this file, and the
   ruling names "the filter button-pill" against "the other 2", which is this
   slot against `SortControl` and `ViewSwitch`. A chip is not one of the
   other 2, and re-deciding CH11 would need its own ruling. The consequence,
   stated rather than hidden: a bar drawn with chips AND this slot puts a
   14/500 pill beside 12/inherited ones. Logged on the register
   (manifest.json → notDelivered, "A chip row that mixes the toolbar pill's
   type step with CH11's").

   Symmetrical padding, because unlike a removable chip there is no control to
   hold off the inline end. The ink no longer drops a tier on its own — it is
   the same `--btn-secondary-label` as the rest of the family, which is what
   "the same pill aspect exactly" asks for; the slot still reads as "not yet
   set" because it is the only pill in the row with no remove control and no
   facet name, not because of a fainter ink. */

           OVERRIDE 42 — the resting edge is `--hair-strong` and there is no
           hover. CH16 draws the facet field the way CH09 draws every field:
           `var(--hair2)` at rest, `var(--hair)` disabled. The build had them
           swapped and promoted 8% to 20% on hover, so a resting facet and a
           disabled one carried the same stroke. The hover came from
           kwapso-ui.css; it is gone and nothing replaces it. */
        /* NO EDGE, JUST THE FILL — client, 2026-09-06, twice. First: "I don't
           like not seeing the contour of these buttons (the filter and so on).
           Please make it beige #F7F2EB." Then, having seen the fill arrive
           beside the edge: "for filter, sort, and all of the buttons in the
           toolbar, I do not want the border. I want them to have a background
           in the beige so I can see them at all times."

           She is right, and the kit already said so for the control next to
           this one: tokens.css, on buttons — "NO border in any state — no
           outline, no hairline, no stroke. A secondary button is a filled
           button in the other paper tone", and "SECONDARY IS A FILL, AND THE
           FILL IS THE AFFORDANCE". The pill was carrying both a fill and a 20%
           edge, which is one affordance too many and the only reason it looked
           unlike `SortControl` and `ViewSwitch` beside it — neither of which
           has ever drawn an edge.

           So the hairline goes and the fill stays. What follows is the history
           of how the fill got here, kept because the reasoning still governs
           WHICH beige this is.

           The contour was there all along: `--hairline-strong` is a real 20%
           edge. What was missing is a FILL, because this pill painted
           `bg-background` — the same tone as the toolbar track it sits on — so
           a hairline was the only thing separating a control from its own
           ground. tokens.css states the principle for buttons in as many words:
           "a secondary button is a filled button in the other paper tone, which
           is why a header band and the buttons inside it are never the same
           paper tone". A pill in a toolbar is that same object and was the one
           control breaking the rule: `SortControl` and `ViewSwitch` beside it
           already spend `--btn-secondary-fill`, which is why those two read as
           objects and this one read as text with a line round it.
     
           `--btn-secondary-fill` RATHER THAN THE LITERAL #F7F2EB she named, and
           it resolves to exactly that here: the token is GROUND-AWARE
           (tokens.css rebinds it per surface, so it is soft paper on an
           off-beige ground and off-beige on a soft-paper one). Writing the
           colour would have been right on this toolbar and invisible on a
           panel, which is the failure the rebind exists to prevent — and it has
           no dark half, so a hex here would have shipped a light-only pill. */

   * horizontal scroller below `sm`, a wrapping row from `sm` up. That is
   * right for a bar standing on its own above a list, where the row may take
   * as many lines as it needs and the page simply gets taller.
   *
   * `"line"` keeps the one-line scroller at EVERY width. It exists because a
   * bar dropped into `CollectionFrame`'s toolbar is not standing on its own:
   * it is one slot in a row the client has ruled must stay a single row
   * ("i want that toolbar is a single row"), and a wrapping chip block is the
   * single largest reason that row grew to four and five lines — measured at
   * 472px of intrinsic width for three chips plus the add slot and clear, on
   * a 699px toolbar at 834. A slot that can wrap inside a row that cannot is
   * a contradiction, and this is the side of it the bar can settle.
   *
   * WHY A PROP AND NOT A CHANGE OF DEFAULT. `FilterBar` is also drawn by
   * `filter-builder`, `archive`, `search-results` and `no-results`, none of
   * which sit inside a one-row toolbar and all of which want the wrapping
   * row they have today. Flipping the default would have narrowed four
   * screens to fix one, so the toolbar asks for what the toolbar needs and
   * nothing else moves. `collection-screen.tsx` is the only caller that
   * passes `"line"`.
   *
   * WHAT IS NOT LOST. A scrolled row hides nothing from the keyboard: every
   * chip and its remove control stay in the tab order, and the browser
   * scrolls a focused chip into view on its own. Nothing here sets
   * `overflow` on the vertical axis by hand — see the row's own note.

 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — the facet controls, then the chips, then clear.
 *  2. hover          — `--accent` on a selectable chip's label and on the clear
 *                      control; `--hair-strong` on a remove control. All three
 *                      are named tokens; none is an opacity, none is mango.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings each chip's label and each
 *                      remove control separately, at the pill radius. Both are
 *                      in the tab order — that is the point of splitting them.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply. The kit draws no pressed chip, and a
 *                      chip's press outcome is immediate (it disappears), so a
 *                      pressed skin would flash for one frame and go.
 *  5. disabled       — per chip: `--hair-faint` fill, `--ink-disabled` ink,
 *                      remove control natively disabled. A fill and an ink.
 *  6. loading        — no chips drawn, `aria-busy` on the bar. The facet
 *                      controls stay: they are how the reader gets out.
 *  7. empty          — no chips, no children: renders NOTHING. An empty bar is
 *                      a strip of nothing above a list, and the kit's rule is
 *                      to prefer nothing. With children but no chips, the
 *                      controls are drawn and no chip row is.
 *  8. error          — does not apply to the bar. A facet that failed to load
 *                      its options reports it inside that facet, where the
 *                      reader can retry; the bar has nothing of its own to
 *                      fetch. GAPS-G.md FLT-5.
 *  9. selected       — every chip drawn IS a selection. That is what the bar
 *                      shows: the facets currently on.
 * 10. read-only      — expressed per chip as `disabled`. A facet the reader may
 *                      see but not drop is a chip with no remove control, which
 *                      is what `disabled` draws.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile  — the chip row is a one-line horizontal scroller. See the header:
 *            this is a decision, and the reasoning is written down there.
 *  tablet  — from `sm` (40rem) the chip row wraps.
 *  desktop — as tablet. The bar never becomes a sidebar on its own; a
 *            composition that wants a facet rail builds one and puts these
 *            facets in it.
 *
 *  `chips="line"` holds the mobile shape at all three, and is what a bar
 *  standing inside `CollectionFrame`'s single-row toolbar is passed. It is
 *  the only thing in this file that any breakpoint answer depends on.
 *
 * RTL — safe. Chips run in DOM order in a flex row, the remove control sits at
 * the INLINE end via `pe-*` and DOM order, and the scroller scrolls the
 * inline axis, which the browser already mirrors.

 * A two-ended numeric facet.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — heading, two dense pill fields, the separator between.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply to a FIELD or a facet mark. CH09 and
 *                      CH16 draw them at rest, at focus and disabled and no
 *                      hover for any of them; the hover this file carried came
 *                      from kwapso-ui.css, and the 20% it promoted to is now
 *                      the resting edge (override 42). Chips and option rows
 *                      still hover — they are rows, not field edges.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 draws the one ring, and the
 *                      field's own hairline does not move under it.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply. A field is not pressed; its equivalent
 *                      moment is focus.
 *  5. disabled       — `--hair-faint` fill, `--ink-disabled` ink, and the WEAK
 *                      8% edge against the resting facet's 20% (override 42).
 *                      A fill and an ink, never an opacity.
 *  6. loading        — the read-only skin plus `aria-busy`, per `input`.
 *  7. empty          — both bounds `null`: the fields show their placeholders
 *                      and the facet is simply not narrowing anything. That is
 *                      a resting state, not a hole to fill with a message.
 *  8. error          — the poppy hairline at 65% on both fields, `aria-invalid`,
 *                      and `errorLabel` in the caption step wired up as the
 *                      fields' description so it is announced and not just seen.
 *  9. selected       — a bound that is set IS the selection, and it is shown as
 *                      the value in the field. The bar draws the chip for it.
 * 10. read-only      — `readOnly`: the edge goes entirely, the faint fill
 *                      carries the state, per chapter 9.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED. The two fields are `w-[6rem]` and sit
 *  in a flex row that wraps if the column is narrower than the pair. They are
 *  already at the dense height at every width, and a range that restacked would
 *  stop reading as one control.
 *
 * RTL — safe. The two fields run in DOM order, so "from" sits at the inline
 * start in every script; every inset is logical and no side is named.

 *                      mango. The search pill has no hover: chapter 9's one
 *                      borderless field has no edge to move.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings the search field and each
 *                      option row at their own radii.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply. Pressing a row toggles it, and the
 *                      selected mark IS the response.
 *  5. disabled       — whole facet: faint fill on the field, `--ink-disabled`
 *                      ink, every row natively disabled. Per option:
 *                      `option.disabled` does the same to one row.
 *  6. loading        — the spinner register in place of the list, announced
 *                      politely. The search field stays usable: the query is
 *                      the reader's own text and no server is filling it in
 *                      (the same reasoning `search-input` records).
 *  7. empty          — two different empties, drawn differently on purpose:
 *                      no options at all is the same register as no matches,
 *                      because to the reader they are the same event —
 *                      "there is nothing here to pick".
 *  8. error          — `Warning` over `errorLabel`, in place of the list.
 *  9. selected       — a filled mark at `--radius-select` on
 *                      `--surface-inverse`, `aria-selected` on the row.
 * 10. read-only      — `readOnly`: rows announce their state and refuse the
 *                      toggle; the field loses its edge, per chapter 9.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED in shape; the facet is `w-full` and
 *  takes its width from whatever holds it. The one thing that does move is the
 *  list's height, which is `maxHeight` and defaults to 14rem — about six rows,
 *  which fits above the keyboard on a phone and does not dominate a rail on a
 *  desktop. A facet that restacked itself would fight the bar it sits in.
 *
 * RTL — safe. The mark leads and the count trails by DOM order inside a flex

/* ============================================================================
   CompactFacet

   FLT-C2 · ADDED 2026-09-02, AND THE GAP IT CLOSES COST A FEATURE.

   This file shipped two facets and neither of them is short. `SearchableFacet`
   is ALWAYS EXPANDED — heading, search pill, and every option as its own
   checkbox row — and `RangeFacet` is two numeric fields. A toolbar or a filter
   panel that wants ONE SHORT FIELD reading "Any client" had nothing to reach
   for, so the consuming app composed one out of the kit's `Select`: a
   `SelectTrigger` over `SelectItem`s, with `FacetLabel`'s two classes written
   out again beside it because `FacetLabel` was private to this file.

   WHAT THAT COST, MEASURED. A `Select` scrolls and takes type-ahead; it does
   not SEARCH. The app's Waves screen filters 131 clients, and the moment the
   facet became a compact select those 131 became a plain scroll — the one
   thing `SearchableFacet`'s search pill existed to prevent. Neither of this
   file's two facets could be both short and searchable, so the app had to
   pick one, and picking "short" is what dropped the search.

   So the compact facet IS optionally searchable, and that is the whole design:
   a trigger the size of `SortControl`'s field, over the same filtered list
   `SearchableFacet` already draws. `searchable` defaults to FALSE — a facet
   over eight words does not need a search field, and drawing one there would
   be a control that never earns its keystroke.

   WHAT IT REUSES RATHER THAN REDRAWS, and why each:
   · `selectTriggerVariants` (select.tsx) for the closed field. Not "the same
     measurements as" — literally the same recipe the sort and view pills are
     drawn through, so a compact facet standing beside them cannot drift from
     them the way `CHIP_ADD` did.
   · `FACET_OPTION_ROW` and `FacetSearch`, both shared with `SearchableFacet`
     in this file. The compact facet is that facet's list behind a trigger; it
     is not a second list.
   · `FacetRegister` for busy / empty / failed, so the three registers read the
     same inside the panel as they do in the open facet.
   · `PopoverContent` for the panel — the kit's one floating surface (ch12:
     "Overlay shadow, 24px radius, no blur"), at the TRIGGER'S width instead of
     chapter 12's fixed 300, because a facet panel wider or narrower than the
     field it drops out of reads as a different control. That is the same rule
     `SelectContent` states as `min-w-[var(--radix-select-trigger-width)]`.

   ONE VALUE, NOT A SET, AND THAT IS THE DECISION.
   `SearchableFacet` is multi-select and stays that way. A COMPACT facet shows
   its value IN ITS TRIGGER, and a trigger holding a set has to summarise it —
   "3 selected", or a truncated list of names. That is a wording the kit has
   not been given and would be inventing, and CH11's answer to "several values
   are on" is the chip row this bar already draws. So: one value or none, and
   `null` is the resting state the `anyLabel` row returns to. The multi-select
   compact case is logged on the register rather than guessed at.

   IT IS A FIELD, NOT A TOOLBAR PILL, AND IT KEEPS CH09'S WEIGHT. The closed
   field is 14/300 — `selectTriggerVariants`' own step, measured 13.125px at
   weight 300 on the verify harness's 15px root. It does NOT take the 500 that
   `CHIP_ADD`, `SortControl` and `ViewSwitch` were just brought to: that 500
   is `ViewSwitch`'s override, and the client's ruling behind it names the
   toolbar's own three controls. A facet is not one of them — it lives in the
   panel the Filter pill OPENS, which is where both surfaces put it — and
   giving a field the button weight because it happens to be short would put
   CH09's step back in play for every other field in the system.
   `size="dense"` exists for exactly that placement: a column of facets inside
   a panel, where a stack of 44s is a tall panel.

   NOT A COMBOBOX, deliberately. The trigger is a disclosure button and the
   panel holds a `listbox`; it does not claim `role="combobox"` the way
   `SelectTrigger` does. A combobox's own field IS the text input, and here
   the text input is a SEARCH over the options, not the value — announcing the
   two as one control would tell a screen-reader reader that typing sets the
   facet, which it does not. The list is the same `role="listbox"` of buttons
   `SearchableFacet` draws, so the two facets are the same shape to assistive
   technology as well as to the eye.

/**
 * A compact, optionally-searchable, single-value facet: one short field, and

 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — heading (unless `hideLabel`), then the closed field:
 *                      `selectTriggerVariants`' pill with the chosen option's
 *                      words, or the placeholder in tertiary ink.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply to the FIELD. CH09 draws a field at
 *                      rest, at focus and disabled and no hover for any of
 *                      them (override 42), and this field is drawn through
 *                      the very recipe that records it. The option ROWS
 *                      hover, to `--accent`, never mango.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings the trigger at its pill
 *                      radius, the search field's shell at its own, and each
 *                      option row at the row's. This file adds none.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply. The press OPENS the panel, and the
 *                      panel is the response — the same reasoning
 *                      `SelectTrigger` records. Open takes the ink hairline
 *                      focus takes, which `selectTriggerVariants` already
 *                      draws off `data-[state=open]`.
 *  5. disabled       — `--hair-faint` fill, `--ink-disabled` label and
 *                      chevron, and the WEAK 8% edge against the resting
 *                      field's 20% (override 42). A fill and an ink.
 *  6. loading        — the spinner register in place of the list, announced
 *                      politely. The trigger stays operable and the search
 *                      field stays usable: the query is the reader's own text
 *                      and no server is filling it in.
 *  7. empty          — no options and no matches are the same register, for
 *                      the same reason `SearchableFacet` gives: to the reader
 *                      they are one event, "there is nothing here to pick".
 *                      A facet with nothing chosen is NOT empty — that is the
 *                      placeholder, and it is a resting state.
 *  8. error          — `Warning` over `errorLabel`, in place of the
 *                      list, inside the panel where the reader can retry.
 *  9. selected       — the chosen option's words replace the placeholder in
 *                      the field and go to primary ink; its row carries the
 *                      tick at the reading end and `aria-selected`. One row
 *                      at a time — see the header.
 * 10. read-only      — `readOnly`: drawn as `disabled`, per the prop.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED in shape. The field takes its width
 *  from whatever holds it and the panel takes its width from the field, so
 *  the control is already as narrow as its container at every size; the panel
 *  is additionally capped by the width and height Radix measured, which is
 *  what keeps it on screen at 320. The list's own cap is `maxHeight`,
 *  defaulting to the same 14rem `SearchableFacet` uses — about six rows,
 *  which clears the keyboard on a phone.
 *
 * RTL — safe. The tick trails and the chevron is placed by `justify-between`
 * rather than by a side; Radix mirrors the panel's alignment from `dir`.
