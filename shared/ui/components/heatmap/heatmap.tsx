/* ============================================================================
   Heatmap — collection view 16, "density per record per week" (0 direct call
   sites; a body swap for `CollectionFrame`).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   Kit chapter 19 ("Collection views · 24 view types · one toolbar contract"),
   view 16, read out of `Design Mothership/kit-current/Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html`.
   The chapter's own line for it, verbatim from the view table:

       heatmap · "Density per record per week" · fits "Where the work went"
                · switch label "Heat"

   and the contract the whole chapter is built on, also verbatim:

       "Every view carries the same contract: search, filters, three actions,
        view switch. Only the body below the toolbar changes."

   So this file is a BODY and nothing else. It draws no toolbar, no pager and
   no heading; `CollectionFrame` owns all three and this sits inside its one
   panel (ruling J2, override register #11).

   THE DRAWING, transcribed
     · header strip — `grid-template-columns: 150px repeat(12, 1fr)`,
       `gap: 6px`, `padding: 4px 12px 8px`, week labels 10px tertiary,
       tabular
     · a row     — the same template and gap, `align-items: center`,
       `padding: 4px 12px`, the record name at 13px
     · a cell    — `height: 22px`, a fill from the ramp, nothing else: no
       label, no stroke, no hover of its own

   THE MANGO TRAP
   Ruling 26 and chapter 2 rule mango a brand fill and never a data colour.
   This view and `PulseBand` are the two the artifact exempts, by name — kit
   ch17 calls the ramp "the mango ramp from the heat map" and gives its four
   steps. `heat-scale.css` carries them and says the rest. No third component
   may read `--heat-*`.

   THE RADIUS, AND A CONFLICT RESOLVED
   Ruling 03 states the law in full: "24px on every box, 999px on every pill,
   6px on marks and selection controls, 4px on a bar, a heat cell or the
   rotated decision node". The chapter-19 drawing predates it and gives the
   cell `border-radius: 24px` — the same drawing gives its chart bars 24 as
   well, which ruling 03 also overturns ("a bar is not a box"). The ruling
   wins, `tokens.css` already named the value `--radius-sm` / `--radius-bar`
   "bars, heat cells, nodes", and the conflict is logged rather than silently
   corrected: GAPS-TRACK2B HM-4.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · A ramp is FOUR FILLS, never four alphas of one colour. There is no
     opacity anywhere in this file, in any state.
   · The empty step is a fill too — `--heat-empty`, the quiet well — so a
     week with no work is drawn rather than left as a hole in the strip.
   · Colour here means QUANTITY, not status. Nothing in this file takes
     forest, sky or poppy, and no cell means "blocked".
   · Colour is never the only carrier. Every cell has a text alternative
     built by `cellLabel`, so the strip is readable by a screen reader and by
     a reader who cannot separate the two lightest steps.
   · No `border`. The strip separates by colour, as ch13 demands.
   · Focus is one global rule (tokens.css §8). This body holds no control.
   · No product vocabulary: records and columns, not apps and weeks.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   No `"use client"`. It forwards props and a ref, holds no state, calls no
   hook and creates no handler during its own render.

/**
 * Density per record per column.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — one strip per record, one fill per cell, at the ramp.
 *  2. hover          — NONE, deliberately. A cell is a reading, not a target;
 *                      the artifact draws no hover on it and a strip that lit
 *                      under the pointer would suggest the cell can be
 *                      pressed. The value is already on the cell as its
 *                      `title`.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      at the control's own radius. This body holds no
 *                      control: nothing in it is focusable.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply, for the same reason as hover.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. A reading cannot be unavailable. A
 *                      record with no work is the EMPTY STEP, which is a
 *                      fill; it is never a dimmed strip, because dimming is
 *                      an opacity and an opacity is a rejection.
 *  6. loading        — `loading`: `Skeleton` bars in the same grid, so the
 *                      placeholder is the shape of the real strip and nothing
 *                      reflows when the data lands.
 *  7. empty          — no rows, or `empty`: the quiet register in place of
 *                      the strip. NOT `null` — a filter that matched nothing
 *                      must say so.
 *  8. error          — `error`: the register with a poppy dot and its own
 *                      wording. Beats `empty`: a request that failed has not
 *                      come back empty.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. The artifact draws no selected cell
 *                      and no selected strip, and this view may not invent
 *                      one. Selection in a collection belongs to the row
 *                      views.
 * 10. read-only      — always. A heat map is a reading and holds no value.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS, and the 380 answer
 *  · mobile (base) — the strip SCROLLS. Twelve columns and a 150 name column
 *    need about 26rem before a cell is narrower than `cellMinWidth`, so at
 *    380 the body scrolls sideways inside its own box and the panel around it
 *    does not. Every cell keeps its drawn height, and the name column keeps
 *    its measure: a heat map whose cells have collapsed to hairlines is not a
 *    smaller heat map, it is an unreadable one. The kit states no narrow
 *    behaviour for this view at all — logged as GAPS-TRACK2B HM-5, and this
 *    is the reading that changes none of its drawn figures.
 *  · tablet (`sm:`) / desktop (`lg:`) — UNCHANGED, and by then the grid fits
 *    without scrolling. The columns are `1fr` and share whatever width there
 *    is, exactly as drawn.
 *
 * RTL — safe, and unused: the system is LTR only (ruling 10). Every inset is
 * logical and the grid's column order follows the document.
