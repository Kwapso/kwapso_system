/* ============================================================================
   Field — the label + control + help + error wrapper (154 direct call sites,
   the most-called component in the system).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-ui.css → `.kw-field` (column, gap
     `--space-2`), `.kw-field__label` (caption step, weight 500, primary ink),
     `.kw-field__help` (badge step, tertiary ink), `.kw-field--error`.
   design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t9.css → `.kw-field__error` and
     `.kw-field__error-dot` (chapter 9: the message is INK text led by a small
     poppy dot — "error text poppy-free"), and `.kw-textbox__footer` /
     `.kw-textbox__count` for the counter row.
   design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t9-inputs.html — the six drawn
     states, and the fact that the error message REPLACES the helper line
     rather than sitting under it.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · This component draws no box, no fill and no hairline of its own. It is a
     stack: header, control, footer. The pill, the hairline and the 65% poppy
     border all belong to the control inside it (`input`, `textarea`,
     `select`), which already draws them.
   · THE MESSAGE IS INK, NEVER POPPY. Chapter 9 is explicit — the poppy lives
     on the field's border and on the small dot, and the words stay readable.
     kwapso-ui.css colours the whole helper line danger; that is the older
     drawing and it loses here, exactly as `input.tsx` ruled it (GAPS.md
     INP-2, restated in GAPS-C.md FLD-1).
   · Disabled is an ink, never an opacity. The root carries `data-disabled`
     and the label and helper read it through `group-data-[disabled]`, which
     is the hook `label.tsx` already ships.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). A Field is not focusable, adds
     no ring and never writes `outline: none`.
   · Every user-facing string is a prop with a default, and the one string
     this file owns — the required marker — is a WORD, not an asterisk. The
     kit's own ruling 26 says the mark never carries meaning alone; a glyph
     that means "required" in one alphabet does not travel to Arabic, Urdu or
     Persian.

   HOW THE CONTROL IS WIRED
   A call site should never have to invent an id. Field mints one, hands it to
   the label, and injects it into the control together with the
   `aria-describedby` chain and `aria-invalid`. Two shapes are accepted:

     <Field label="Account name" help="Shown on every invoice.">
       <Input />
     </Field>

     <Field label="Time zone">
       {(control) => (
         <Select><SelectTrigger {...control}><SelectValue /></SelectTrigger></Select>
       )}
     </Field>

   The second exists because a composed control keeps its accessible identity
   on an inner element — `SelectTrigger`, not `Select` — and a blind clone
   onto the root would put the id on the wrong node.

   ONLY ARIA IS INJECTED, NEVER A COMPONENT PROP. `aria-invalid` reaches the
   skin because `input`, `textarea` and `select` all fold it into their own
   `error` state themselves. Injecting an `error` prop instead would land an
   unknown attribute on a bare `<input>` and warn.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. `React.useId` is a hook, so this module cannot render as a
   Server Component even though it attaches no handler of its own.

/**
 * The system's form row.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — label above, control, helper below. No box of its own.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply. A Field is a stack, not a control; the
 *                      control inside it owns the border shift to
 *                      `--hair-strong`, and a wash on the row behind a field
 *                      would fight the field's own fill.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings the control at once, and
 *                      the control moves its own border to ink. A Field is
 *                      not in the tab order and adds nothing.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply. Nothing here is pressed; a click on
 *                      the label hands focus to the control.
 *  5. disabled       — `data-disabled` on the root; label and helper go to
 *                      `--ink-disabled` through the `group-data-[disabled]`
 *                      hook `label.tsx` already ships. An ink, never an
 *                      opacity. The control takes its own faint fill.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply to the wrapper. A field whose value has
 *                      not arrived takes the read-only skin and announces
 *                      `aria-busy` on the CONTROL (`input`, `textarea`); the
 *                      label and helper are known before the value is, so
 *                      there is nothing here to defer.
 *  7. empty          — the control's placeholder, in tertiary ink. A Field
 *                      with no label, no help and no error renders the
 *                      control alone rather than reserving empty rows.
 *  8. error          — `error`: the helper line is replaced by a small poppy
 *                      dot and an INK message, and the control receives
 *                      `aria-invalid` and draws its own 65% poppy border.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. A form row is not selectable; the
 *                      selected thing is a value inside the control.
 * 10. read-only      — passed through untouched. The control loses its border
 *                      entirely (chapter 9: "system-set values lose the
 *                      border"); the label and helper are unchanged, because
 *                      a read-only value still needs saying what it is.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED. A field row is one column at every
 *  width and takes its width from the parent. Chapter 9's one responsive
 *  statement is the FORM's — one column below 48rem, two above, never three —
 *  and it belongs to the form shell, which places Fields in a grid. A field
 *  that restacked itself would fight that grid.
 *
 * RTL — safe. The stack is vertical, the header and footer rows are ordered by
 * `gap` and `justify-between`, and no side is named. The error dot leads the
 * message on the reading-start side in Arabic, Urdu and Persian because it is
 * the first child, not because it is positioned.

             This row was `flex items-baseline gap-2` with both children at
             their natural width, so the marker sat immediately after the
             label wherever the label happened to end. The consuming app was
             pushing it to the trailing edge from OUTSIDE, with a descendant
             selector into this component's own slot —
             `[&_[data-slot=field-required]]:order-last` plus `ms-auto` — which

             override is deletable; it is called out in the CHANGELOG so the
             lead can remove it.

             Three classes, and each one is doing a job. `justify-between`
             puts the marker at the trailing edge (logical, so it follows
             `dir="rtl"` with nothing else written). `min-w-0` on the label

             below its content width and a long label shoves the marker off
             the end, which is the failure the app's `ms-auto` never fixed
             either. `shrink-0` keeps the marker itself whole, because it is
