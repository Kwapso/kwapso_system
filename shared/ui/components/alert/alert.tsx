/* ============================================================================
   Alert — the inline, non-interrupting notice (0 direct call sites).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-patterns.css → `.kw-alert`,
   `.kw-alert__dot` and the four severity rules, drawn in
   `_fragments/t20-feedback.html` block (e). The kit's own caption under the
   specimen is the whole design brief:

       "The state lives in the dot. The panel stays neutral — accents never
        become a background."

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · The panel is ALWAYS `--surface-raised` and the ink is always the normal
     ink. A destructive alert is not a poppy panel; it is a neutral panel with
     a poppy dot. Filling a panel with poppy is on the kit's own Don't list
     ("Fill a panel with sky, forest, or poppy").
   · Radius is `--radius` (24). An alert is a box, not a bar and not a pill.
   · The warning dot is MANGO — the artifact's own `var(--mango)` in the ch20
     specimen, restored 2026-08-26. ALR-2's poppy re-pointing is retired: it
     had decayed to the quiet fill when the `--warning` BADGE token moved
     under ruling 3B, leaving the dot with no colour at all. Override 17
     makes the drawn mark legal (mango counts ACTIONS, not marks).
   · No border. Same-tone separation is the fill, per ruling 03/26.
   · Every string is a prop. This component in fact holds none: the dot is
     `aria-hidden` and the body copy is the caller's children.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   No `"use client"`. No hook, no state, no browser API, no event handler.

     palettes against a `Sheet` — which is not a hypothetical placement:

     that form inside a sheet. An alert is handed its ground by a call site

/**
 * An inline notice inside the layout. Not a toast, not a dialog.

 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — neutral raised panel, severity in the dot.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply. An alert is not a target; it holds no
 *                      control of its own. A dismiss or an action inside one
 *                      is a `Button` and carries `Button`'s hover.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      and an alert is not focusable in the first place.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. A notice cannot be switched off; the
 *                      call site stops rendering it.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply. An alert states a fact that has already
 *                      happened. A pending fact is a `Skeleton` or a `Spinner`.
 *  7. empty          — no children renders `null`. An empty raised panel with
 *                      a coloured dot and nothing to say is noise.
 *  8. error          — `variant="destructive"`. It is the whole point of the
 *                      component rather than a state layered on top of it.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply.
 * 10. read-only      — does not apply. There is nothing to write to.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED, deliberately. The alert is a
 *  full-width block that inherits its measure from the parent, and its only
 *  intrinsic dimensions are the kit's inset (14/16) and the dot (8), neither
 *  of which the kit varies by width. The copy reflows; the dot rail does not
 *  move, so a two-line alert on mobile keeps the same hanging indent it has
 *  on desktop. Responsive width is the composition's grid, not this file.
 *
 * RTL — safe. The dot rail is `gap`-driven inside a flex row, so it moves to
 * the inline start under `dir="rtl"` with nothing written here. Every inset is
 * logical (`px-*` is padding-inline).
