   ActivityFeed — a record's history, newest first (3 direct call sites).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   Kit chapter 18 ("Data display · KPIs · progress · charts · calendar ·
   board"), the block captioned "Activity feed", read out of
   `Design Mothership/kit-current/Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html`. Kept figure for
   figure:

     · the row    — `display: grid; grid-template-columns: 74px 24px 1fr;
                     BUILT as `24px 1fr auto` -- ruling R2 moved the time to
                     the trailing end, per 27.9 and 27.34. See the cva.
                     gap: 14px; align-items: start; padding: 12px 0;
                     box-shadow: inset 0 -1px 0 var(--hair);` and the last row
                     drops the rule
     · the time   — 12 / tertiary ink / tabular figures
     · the mark   — 24 pill on `--card`, initials at 10 / 500, `flex: none`
     · the line   — 13.5 / 1.45, primary ink, with the record's name at 500

   Chapter 19 draws the same block a second time as collection view 15
   ("feed") at `96px 28px 1fr`. Two drawings, one picture; chapter 18's
   figures are the ones taken, because 74 is the narrower and therefore the
   one that survives a 320 viewport.

   The three registers are `kwapso-ui.css` → `.kw-empty` and
   `kwapso-patterns.css` → `.kw-register`, reached through
   `CollectionRegister` so that nine collections cannot drift apart.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · A pill is a person, a square is a thing, at 24 / 32 / 48 with `flex:
     none` (ruling 30). The feed's mark is 24 — `Avatar size="sm"` — and it
     never shrinks, so the text column never eats it on a narrow row.
   · Every number in a column or a timestamp is tabular (kit chapter 03).
   · Blocks are separated by colour, not by strokes — but same-tone row
     separation is the blessed hairline, and that is exactly what these rules
     are. `--border`, not the heavier `--hair-strong`, which is a SECTION rule.
   · Ruling 02: nothing hardcodes 9, 10 or 11 any more, and uppercase eyebrows
     keep 11. The kit's 12 time and 13.5 line therefore land on `text-xs` and
     `text-caption`; the 10 initials are `Avatar size="sm"`'s own `text-micro`,
     which is the eyebrow step and is allowed to be 11.
   · A row that is a target takes `--accent`, the neutral row wash. Never
     mango: mango is a brand fill, never a hover.
   · Focus is one global rule (tokens.css §8). Nothing here draws a ring.
   · No product vocabulary. This is a history of ENTRIES about RECORDS, and
     the words in it are the caller's.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"` — `onSelect` is turned into a per-row handler during this
   module's own render (PATTERN §8).

       Chapter 18 draws `74px 24px 1fr`: time first, in a fixed column, every
       timestamp aligned down the page. 27.9 and 27.34 both draw the time at
       the TRAILING end instead, and 27.34's whole argument is that the inbox
       reuses the log's row rather than teaching a second one -- so the two
       could not both stand. The client took the trailing time: the sentence
       starts at the margin and gets the full measure, and the time is where
       the eye lands last.

       The time column is `auto`, not a fixed 74: trailing, its job is to take
       what the string needs and no more. One answer applied here fixes 27.9,
       27.34 and the record footer at once, which is why it is one component. */

       note was "align horizontally avatar + text on activity + footer", read
       off a ONE-LINE entry where the mark hangs below the sentence. The
       obvious answer is the wrong one: this same row also carries WRAPPED
       entries (a note that runs to four lines is ordinary here), and a centred
       mark on a four-line block floats to the middle of the paragraph instead
       of sitting beside the sentence it belongs to. Both shapes are drawn side
       by side in verify/feed-align.

       MEASURED, not derived-and-hoped: verify/feed-align reads
       `getComputedStyle(...).lineHeight` off the real span at the real root
       and returns 17.6719px. Note WHICH leading that is — `--leading-normal`
       (1.45), the one the sentence sets for itself below, NOT
       `--text-caption--line-height` (1.4), which the step carries by default
       and which this row overrides. Reading the token's own 1.4 here would be
       0.6px wrong and would look right.

       It is a product of tokens, so it follows the text-size control: at
       data-scale small/large the root moves to 13/17px and every number below

          THE LIFT. The mark is 22.5 (`--avatar-sm`, 1.5rem at the 15px root)
          and the first line's box is 17.672. Under `items-start` their TOPS
          are flush, so the mark's centre lands (22.5 - 17.672) / 2 = 2.414
          BELOW the line's centre — and the `mt-px` that used to sit here
          pushed it a further 1px down, for a measured 3.414. That is the
          "avatar sits low" the client saw, in both hosts, in both shapes.

            margin-top = (--feed-line - --avatar-sm) / 2
                       = (1.178125rem - 1.5rem) / 2
                       = -0.1609375rem
                       = -2.414px at the 15px root

          NEGATIVE, and that is the general form rather than a special case:
          the subtraction is written line-minus-mark and not the other way
          round, so the SAME expression pushes the mark DOWN if a future mark
          is ever shorter than its line. Nothing has to be re-derived, and
          nothing needs a `max()` to stop it going the wrong way.

          THE EQUAL AND OPPOSITE `margin-bottom` IS NOT DECORATION. A bare
          negative margin-top shrinks the grid track by the same 2.414 — the
          track is sized from the MARGIN box — so a one-line row would have
          quietly lost 2.4 of its height and the mark would have eaten into
          the 12 of padding chapter 18 draws above it. Cancelling the lift at
          the bottom keeps the mark's LAYOUT footprint at exactly 24 (ruling
          30's "24 with flex: none") while its OPTICAL position moves. Measured
          in verify/feed-align: the one-line row lands at 45.0, which is the
          drawn geometry with no nudge in it at all; before this change it was
          46.0, and the extra 1 was the `mt-px`.

          RESIDUE, KNOWN AND DELIBERATELY NOT CHASED. This centres the mark on
          the LINE BOX. Saans's own content box (ascent+descent, 14px here) is
          not centred inside that line box — the browser reports 1 of half-
          leading above and 2.672 below — so the glyphs' own centre is a
          further 0.836 above where the mark now sits. Chasing that last 0.836
          would mean hardcoding one font file's vertical metrics, which no
          token holds and which the fallback face does not share (tokens.css
          section 5.0 records the same trap for `ch`). The line box is the only
          centre a stylesheet can hold, so it is the one taken. */}

          THE DROP — and the answer to "is this `mt-px` doing anything?". It
          was, and it was very nearly right, which is exactly why it survived
          this long. The time is `text-xs`, a SHORTER line than the sentence
          beside it (0.75rem x 1.35 = 1.0125rem = 15.188), so to sit on the
          sentence's first line it has to come DOWN:

            margin-top = (--feed-line - --text-xs x --text-xs--line-height) / 2
                       = (1.178125rem - 1.0125rem) / 2
                       = 0.08281rem
                       = 1.242px at the 15px root

          `mt-px` is 1px. MEASURED in verify/feed-align: it left the time's
          centre 0.242 ABOVE the sentence's — an eighth of a pixel per side,
          invisible, and a coincidence of the 15px root rather than a rule. It
          is kept as a real derivation rather than deleted, because deleting it
          would be a 1.242 regression, and rather than left at `px`, because at
          data-scale small the true value is 1.077 and at large it is 1.408 and
          a hardcoded 1 is wrong in both directions.

/**
 * A record's history.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — a column of entries, each a time, a mark and a line,
 *                      hairline-separated, newest first.
 *  2. hover          — only with `onSelect`: `--accent`, the neutral row and
 *                      item wash. Never mango, never an opacity. A feed whose
 *                      entries do not open has no hover, deliberately — a
 *                      page of reacting rows that lead nowhere is noise.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      at the control's own radius. An interactive row is a
 *                      real `button`, so it is reachable and ringed without
 *                      this file writing anything.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply. The kit draws no pressed feed row, and
 *                      a row that nudged would fight the page scroll under a
 *                      thumb. Logged as GAPS-COL1 AF-3.
 *  5. disabled       — per entry (`item.disabled`): `--ink-disabled` and no
 *                      button at all, so it is neither hoverable nor
 *                      focusable. A fill is not used because the row has none
 *                      to begin with; the ink alone is the whole treatment.
 *  6. loading        — `loading`: `Skeleton variant="list"`, which is that
 *                      primitive's whole job. Cold cache only — the kit's
 *                      third loading tier says a warm re-fetch keeps the
 *                      stale rows and marks them busy rather than blanking
 *                      the panel.
 *  7. empty          — no entries: the quiet register. NOT `null`, because a
 *                      record with no history is a real answer and an
 *                      unexplained hole is not. Where a composition wants the
 *                      whole block to vanish it does not mount the feed —
 *                      kwapso-ui.css warns about exactly that beside
 *                      `.kw-empty`.
 *  8. error          — `error`: the register with a poppy dot and its own
 *                      wording, which is chapter 21's "say what happened,
 *                      then the one next step". Beats `empty` in precedence:
 *                      a request that failed has not come back empty, it has
 *                      not come back.
 *  9. selected       — the kit draws no selected feed entry. Not invented;
 *                      logged as GAPS-COL1 AF-2. A composition that needs one
 *                      marks it with its own `className` on the item until
 *                      there is a ruling.
 * 10. read-only      — always. A history is a record of what happened; there
 *                      is nothing here to write to.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS — one geometry, at every width
 *  Ruling R2 simplified this. While the time led, the column had to be `auto`
 *  at 320 (a fixed 74 left 200 for the line) and step to the drawn 74 from
 *  `sm:` so the times aligned — two states, and a deliberate raggedness at the
 *  small one. Trailing, the time takes what its string needs and no more at
 *  every width, so mobile, tablet and desktop draw the SAME three columns:
 *  `24px 1fr auto`. Nothing steps and nothing is ragged, because there is no
 *  longer a column edge for the times to fail to meet.
 *
 *  The sentence gets the full remaining measure at 320, which is what a
 *  history line needed all along.
 *
 * RTL — safe, and unused: the system is LTR only. Every inset is logical, the
 * grid columns follow the writing direction on their own, and `text-start`
 * rather than `text-left` keeps the button's label where the reader expects.
