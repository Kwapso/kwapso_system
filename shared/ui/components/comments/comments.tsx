   Comments — threaded discussion with mentions (2 direct call sites).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-patterns.css, CH22 — "Notifications &
   threads · Every note names a person and a record." Every figure below is
   transcribed, not derived:

     .kw-comment          display: flex; gap: var(--space-2h);          (10)
     .kw-comment__avatar  --avatar-sm (24), pill, --surface-raised,
                            --text-micro, --weight-strong

     .kw-composer__ghost  --text-caption; t22.css makes it a real input,
                            primary ink with the tertiary moved to
                            ::placeholder (T22-5)
     .kw-composer__send   32 tall, padding-inline 12, pill,

     .kw-notif__dot       7 pill, `margin-top: 0.375rem`, the unread mark
     .kw-notif__mark      --text-badge, --ink-tertiary, the "mark read" control

   design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t22.css → `.t22-comments { gap:
     var(--space-4) }`, the distance between two comments.
   design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-ui.css → `.kw-empty`, the centred
     register. kwapso-patterns.css CH21 → `.kw-register`, the error register.

   WHAT THE KIT DOES NOT DRAW, AND WHAT WAS DONE — all logged in GAPS-COL2
   · No reply nesting, no `.kw-reply`, no indent. Built: ONE level, indented
     by the row's own geometry (`--avatar-sm` + `--space-2h`), so a reply's
     mark lands under its parent's body. GAPS-COL2 CMT-1.
   · No resolved state. Built: a quiet `Badge` and the actions withdrawn — no
     fill change, because a wash would fight the row hover. CMT-2.
   · No comment actions row. Built: `Button variant="link"` at the badge step.
   · Unread: the kit's own dot is `--danger`. The batch ruling is that poppy
     means BLOCKED only, so the dot here is the neutral ink dot
     (`--foreground`) and the words say it too. CONTRADICTION, CMT-3.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · THE STACK, THE GAP AND THE TWO REGISTERS ARE `Notes`'. This file does not
     re-draw them: it renders `Notes` in its composed-children mode, which
     supplies `.t22-comments`' `--space-4` column, the `aria-busy`, and both
     of chapter 21's registers already transcribed. What this file adds is the
     threading, the mentions, the actions and the composer.
   · THE MARK IS A PERSON, SO IT IS `Avatar` AT 24. Ruling 30 fixes the three
     mark sizes and `Avatar` enforces the two-initial rule once for the whole
     system. A second circle drawn here would be a second system.
   · THE COMPOSER'S FIELD IS BARE ON PURPOSE. `.kw-composer` IS the pill —
     `--surface-raised` at the pill radius with the inset the kit states. An
     `Input` inside it would draw a SECOND pill and a second hairline, exactly
     the doubling `field.tsx` refuses when it takes the textarea's counter into
     its own footer. The stacked composer, which has room for a real box, uses
     the real `Textarea`.
   · THE SEND CONTROL IS `Button variant="inverse" size="sm"`. That is
     `.kw-composer__send` figure for figure — 32 tall, pill, charcoal fill,
     off-beige label — so no button is hand-rolled here.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). Nothing here rings and nothing
     writes `outline: none`; the bare composer input keeps the shared ring.
   · Disabled is a fill and an ink, never an opacity.
   · Every user-facing string is a prop with a default.
   · No product vocabulary (commission §11). People, comments, replies,
     mentions.

   RENDERING CONTEXT

   * read: "the kit draws ONE mention in ONE thread, and separately rules
   * 'one mango per view'. A busy thread with five mentions renders five mango
   * pills and the colour stops meaning anything" (GAPS-COL2 CMT-4). That is
   * the exact reading the register overturned on 2026-08-23:
   *
   *     17 · "One mango per screen counts ACTIONS, not objects. One filled
   *          control you can press; any number of non-interactive marks."
   *
   * and its own worked examples are this species — *"CH26.05's three 'Picked'
   * chips stand beside a mango Next, 27.34's unread rows each keep the mango
   * mark"*. A mention names a person; it is a mark, not the view's action.
   * `calendar-view`'s event chip was moved back to `brand` on the same
   * override and for the same sentence; `comments` was the one the sweep did
   * not reach. CH22's page draws the mango pill. CMT-4 is closed by 17.
   *
   * `self` and `quiet` both stay, so an application that wants the quieter
   * thread keeps it with one prop and no fork.

/**
 * A threaded discussion.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — the kit's comment rows, `--space-4` apart, with the
 *                      composer pill at the end.
 *  2. hover          — the CONTROLS' only. A comment row does not wash under
 *                      the pointer: it is read, not operated, and a whole
 *                      thread that lit up row by row would be noise. The
 *                      actions are `Button variant="link"`, which underlines
 *                      on hover, and the send control is `Button
 *                      variant="inverse"`, which takes `--btn-inverse-hover`.
 *                      Named tokens, never an opacity, never mango.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      at the control's own radius — the bare composer input
 *                      included, which is why t22.css's own note says nothing
 *                      sets `outline: none` and nothing here does either.
 *  4. active/pressed — the controls' 1px nudge, which `Button` owns. A comment
 *                      is not pressed.
 *  5. disabled       — `disabled`: the composer's field takes `--hair-faint` /
 *                      `--ink-disabled` from `Textarea`'s own skin (and the
 *                      inline pill mirrors it), and the send control takes
 *                      `--btn-disabled-fill` / `--btn-disabled-label`. A fill
 *                      and an ink. A COMMENT is never disabled — it is a thing
 *                      that was written.
 *  6. loading        — two different waits, deliberately separate. `loading`
 *                      is the THREAD arriving: `aria-busy`, no register, no
 *                      skeleton invented over an unknown number of rows.
 *                      `sending` is one MESSAGE in flight: the composer goes
 *                      read-only and the send control keeps its fill and grows
 *                      a spinner (`button.tsx`'s rule). `item.pending` is a
 *                      comment already on screen and not yet acknowledged.
 *  7. empty          — `.kw-empty` through `Notes`: the centred register,
 *                      tertiary ink, with `emptyLabel` — and the composer
 *                      still under it, because an empty thread is exactly
 *                      where someone wants to write.
 *  8. error          — three tiers. The THREAD failing is `Notes`' register:
 *                      ink words with one poppy dot, announced as an alert.
 *                      One COMMENT failing to send is chapter 9's message
 *                      under its body. The composer's own validation belongs
 *                      to the caller and arrives as a `Field`, not here.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply to a comment; the kit draws none and a
 *                      thread is not a chooser. What DOES mark one comment out
 *                      is `highlight` (the brand mark, one per view) and
 *                      `unread` (the neutral dot plus its words) — both are
 *                      meanings, not selection states.
 * 10. read-only      — `readOnly`, or `composer="none"`: the thread reads and
 *                      the composer is withdrawn entirely, which is chapter
 *                      9's rule that a system-set value loses its box applied
 *                      to a whole control (`file-upload.tsx` does the same).
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile   — the reply indent COLLAPSES TO NOTHING below 40rem and each
 *             reply keeps a rule on its inline-start edge instead. At 320 the
 *             row is already 24 of mark plus 10 of gap; taking another 34 off
 *             the measure leaves a reply about 250 wide, which wraps a normal
 *             sentence to four lines. The rule is the cheapest thing that
 *             still says "this is inside that": it costs one hairline and no
 *             measure at all. The composer stacks its send control under the
 *             field at the same width, so a thumb is not reaching across a
 *             pill for a 32 target.
 *  tablet   — the indent returns at 40rem: `--avatar-sm` + `--space-2h`, so a
 *             reply's own mark lands exactly under its parent's body and the
 *             nesting is legible without a rule.
 *  desktop  — UNCHANGED from tablet. The thread takes its measure from the
 *             parent; a comment does not get wider on a wide screen, because
 *             a 13/1.45 line past about 70 characters is harder to read, not
 *             easier. The parent panel caps it.
 *
 * RTL — safe, with one deliberate change from the kit. `.kw-comment__time`
 * separates itself with `margin-left: var(--space-2h)`, which is physical;
 * here the name and the time are two items in a flex row with a `gap`, so the
 * time follows the name in both directions — the same correction `notes.tsx`
 * makes. The reply indent is `ms-*` (margin-inline-start) and its rule is
 * `border-s`, so both mirror. `.kw-composer`'s asymmetric 16/8 inset is
 * `ps-4 pe-2`, which mirrors too.
