/* ============================================================================
   Dialog — the modal (115 direct call sites).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-patterns.css → CH20 `.kw-scrim`,
   `.kw-modal`, `.kw-modal__title`, `.kw-modal__body`, `.kw-modal__row`.
   The close chip is `.kw-drawer__close` from the same chapter — the kit draws
   a close control on the drawer and not on the modal, and the modal needs one.
   Motion is motion/motion.css §3 (`.motion-scrim`, `.motion-dialog`).
   Not shadcn. Where the two disagree, the kwapso specimen wins.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · The overlay surface is `--popover` at `--radius` (24) under
     `--shadow-overlay`. One radius, one elevation, no blur, no border.
     (The kit's own `.kw-modal` says `--surface-page`; the batch's binding law
      and tokens.css both say `--popover`. Both sides in GAPS-A.md OVL-1.)
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). This file defines no ring and
     never writes an outline reset. Radix's own focus trap moves the caret in;
     the ring that shows where it landed is the token layer's.
   · No duration, no curve, no keyframe is written here. `.motion-scrim` and
     `.motion-dialog` already carry both directions and read Radix's
     `data-state`, so one class covers open and close.
   · Every string is a prop with a default — `closeLabel` is the only one this
     file holds, and it exists because a close control with no accessible name
     is unusable in Arabic, Urdu or Persian just as it is in English.
   · Logical properties only. The dialog is centred by a grid, not by a
     translate, so nothing here has an inline direction at all.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. Radix Dialog holds open state, portals to the document and
   attaches document-level listeners; it cannot render in a Server Component.

   The scrim. Kit-stated as charcoal at 36%, with no dark twin drawn and the
   note "kept identical" — so it must stay charcoal in BOTH palettes, which is
   why it cannot be mixed from `--foreground` or `--surface-inverse` (both of
   those flip to off-beige in dark and would produce a white scrim).

   THERE IS A `--scrim` TOKEN NOW, AND THIS FILE NO LONGER MIXES ITS OWN —
   CHANGED 2026-09-07. What stood here was an arbitrary background holding a
   `color-mix` of the raw charcoal at 36% against transparent — spelled out,
   because PATTERN §10's lesson is that Tailwind scans this file's comments
   too and cannot tell an explanation from an intention, so the old class is
   DESCRIBED here rather than written — under a paragraph saying the raw
   palette layer was being reached deliberately
   because no semantic token stays charcoal in both themes (GAPS-A.md OVL-2).
   That was true, and it was never the fix: OVL-2's own text says the fix is a
   token. By this week the same expression was written out by hand in four
   files and `edge-panel.tsx` was about to make it five. tokens.css §3 now
   states the pair and §10 bridges it, so the scrim is a NAMED utility over a
   value decided in the one file allowed to decide a colour. Same 36%, same
   charcoal in both palettes; nothing renders differently.

   z: the kit puts the modal scrim at 60 and the drawer scrim at 55. Kept.

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The positioner. A grid that centres its one child, sitting inside the same
   inset as the scrim so the dialog can never touch the viewport edge.

   Why a wrapper rather than the usual `top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2`: a translate
   utility on the content would fight `.motion-dialog`, whose keyframes own
   `transform`, and the loser is decided by stylesheet order. It also removes
   every physical inset from this file — a grid centres identically in RTL.

   `pointer-events-none` so a click in the gutter still lands on the scrim
   below and dismisses; the content turns them back on for itself.

   WHY THE TRACK IS SPELLED OUT — `grid-cols-[minmax(0,auto)]`.
   A bare `grid` makes ONE implicit column whose sizing function is `auto`.
   An `auto` track's base size is its item's min-content CONTRIBUTION, and a
   grid item that declares a definite `width` contributes that width — 460 —
   in both directions, because its `max-width: 100%` is cyclic during
   intrinsic sizing and is dropped. So the track was sized to 460, and a track
   is never shrunk below its base size. `max-width: 100%` then resolved
   against the GRID AREA — the 460 track — which is the dialog's own width, so
   the rule was self-referential and could never bite. Measured at a real 380
   viewport: the surface stayed 431.25 wide (rem is 15px here, so 28.75rem is
   431.25), its right edge landed at 453.75, and the close chip sat at 401 —
   entirely past the viewport, unreachable.

   `minmax(0, auto)` gives the track a base size of 0 and a growth limit of
   max-content, so it grows to the available 335 and stops. `max-width: 100%`
   now resolves against 335 and the surface fits. Re-measured: 335 wide, right
   edge 357.5, close chip on screen.

   NOT `min-width: 0` on the content: that was tried and changes nothing. The
   automatic minimum size was never the binding constraint — min-content here
   is 228.5, far under the available width. The track was the whole defect.

 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — `--popover` at 24 under `--shadow-overlay`, 32 inset,
 *                      over a charcoal 36% scrim.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply to the surface. The only hoverable thing
 *                      this file draws is the close chip, which moves from
 *                      `--surface-panel` to `--surface-quiet`. A colour swap,
 *                      never a fade.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *                      Radix moves focus into the dialog and traps it; this
 *                      file adds no ring and no outline reset.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply. A surface is not pressed.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. A dialog is open or it is not; there is
 *                      no disabled modal. A form inside it disables its own
 *                      controls, which is `button` and `input`'s job.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply to the surface, deliberately. A dialog
 *                      that is waiting keeps its own frame and shows the wait
 *                      in its body (`skeleton`) or on its submit control
 *                      (`Button loading`). Blanking the whole modal would
 *                      destroy the reader's place. Stated, not omitted.
 *  7. empty          — does not apply. A dialog with no children is a bug at
 *                      the call site, not a state to draw; Radix still
 *                      requires a `DialogTitle` for the accessibility tree.
 *  8. error          — does not apply to the surface. An error belongs to the
 *                      field that failed or to an `alert` in the body; a poppy
 *                      modal frame would colour the whole conversation.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply.
 * 10. read-only      — does not apply.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile   — the gutter drops to `--space-6` (24) so the 460 surface has room;
 *             `max-w-full` then makes the dialog as wide as that gutter allows,
 *             which is the kit's own `max-width: 100%`. The 32 inset INSIDE the
 *             dialog is unchanged: shrinking it would break the one measurement
 *             the kit does state.
 *  tablet   — gutter at the kit's `--space-7` (32) from `sm` (40rem) up. The
 *             surface reaches its full 460 and stops growing.
 *  desktop  — UNCHANGED from tablet. A modal does not widen with the viewport;
 *             a 460 measure is the design.
 *  At every width the surface scrolls inside itself (`max-h-full
 *  overflow-y-auto`) rather than pushing the page, so a long dialog on a phone
 *  in landscape stays reachable.
 *
 * RTL — safe. The dialog is centred by `place-items-center`, not by a
 * translate, and the close chip is placed with `end-*`. No physical side is
 * named anywhere in this file.

 * footers are written cancel-first, so the kit order would have silently
 * re-read every one of them, and end-aligned-primary-last is the web/Windows
 * convention these apps already teach their users.

 * `flex-col-reverse` below the sm breakpoint puts the primary on TOP of the
