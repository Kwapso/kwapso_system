/* ============================================================================
   StatusStepper — the record's progression (2 direct call sites).

   DESIGN SOURCE — CHAPTER 23, NOT 27
   "Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html" → `<section id="ch23">` "Auth & account", the
   sub-specimen headed

       "Record hero with the stages in it"
       "Seven named stages · the portal shows three"

   and its spec line, verbatim and load-bearing:

       "Stage pills 12.5px / 26px tall · done takes the paper fill, current
        takes mango with a charcoal label, later stages take the quiet fill
        with disabled ink · a stage is pressable and scrolls the record to
        that stage's panel · over five stages the tail folds into “+n” · the
        portal collapses the same seven into with us / with you / done"

   Transcribed into design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-patterns.css as
   `.kw-stages`, `.kw-stage`, `.kw-stage__n`, `.kw-stage--current`,
   `.kw-stage--later`, which is where the 12.5 becomes the badge step ("it IS
   status text under ruling 02; the kit's 12.5 is the retired non-step") and
   the height becomes `--control-height-pill` (26).

   The kit ALSO draws a second stepper, in chapter 15 (Navigation), headed
   "Stepper — programme phases": four equal columns, each a 26 mark over a
   hairline connector with the label beneath. That is `variant="steps"`
   below. It is an ADDED variant — the commission lists none for this folder
   and PATTERN §2 permits additions — and it exists because motion/motion.css
   ships `.motion-step-connector` for exactly this drawing and because the
   chapter draws it. Both variants are the kit's own; neither is invented.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · ONE MANGO PER VIEW, AND IT IS THE PRESENT. The current stage carries the
     only mango in the hero. This is not mango-as-a-status, which ruling 26
     forbids — it is mango marking position, the same use `.kw-stage--current`
     makes and the same use t20-gaps.md T20-3 records as explicitly not
     violating the ruling. Done and later stages carry no accent at all.
   · Charcoal on every accent: the current pill's label is `--ink-on-accent`,
     never white, in both palettes.
   · Every pill is a pill (`--radius-pill`). No box radius reaches this file.
   · Disabled is a fill and an ink — `--surface-idle` with `--ink-disabled` —
     which is exactly how the kit already draws a LATER stage. "Later is
     disabled ink, not hidden": a record that hides its future reads as
     finished.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). A pressable stage is a real
     button and the ring lands on it at its own radius. No ring here.
   · Motion is `.motion-step` (colour) and `.motion-step-connector` (the fill
     between two marks, a scaleX whose origin motion.css already mirrors
     under `dir="rtl"`). No keyframe, no duration and no curve is written in
     this file.
   · Numbers are tabular and never drop — "we are at three of seven" is the
     sentence a client repeats back — and they go through `formatNumber`, so
     a document in Arabic, Urdu or Persian gets its own numerals.

   THE SEVEN-STAGE CASE AT MOBILE WIDTH — WHAT IT DOES AND WHY
   The kit answers this itself and the answer is NOT a media query: "over
   five stages the tail folds into '+n'", and the kit's own drawing of the
   seven-stage record shows five pills followed by a "+2". So `maxVisible`
   defaults to 5 and the fold is unconditional — the same at 320 as at 1440.
   Two reasons that is right rather than lazy. A fold that only happened on a
   phone would mean the client and the account manager are looking at two
   different progressions while talking to each other on a call, which is the
   one thing this hero exists to prevent. And a width-triggered fold needs a
   breakpoint the kit never states, which would be an invented value.
   Underneath the fold, `.kw-stages` is `flex-wrap`, so five pills that still
   do not fit at 320 wrap to a second line rather than scrolling out of
   reach. A four-stage progression is under the fold and draws all four,
   which is the other case this component has to handle.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. A pressable stage means this module builds an event
   handler during its own render.

 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — the kit's three positions at once: done stages on
 *                      `--surface-raised` with a tertiary-ink number, the
 *                      current stage on mango with a charcoal label at
 *                      weight 500, later stages on `--surface-idle` with
 *                      `--ink-disabled`.
 *  2. hover          — a pressable stage takes one defined step from its own
 *                      fill: `--surface-quiet` for done and later,
 *                      `--btn-primary-hover` for the mango current pill. A
 *                      colour swap, never a fade, and never `--primary`
 *                      itself. The kit draws no hover for `.kw-stage` at all;
 *                      derived, and logged as GAPS-CE STP-2.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      at the pill's own radius.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply as a skin. Pressing a stage navigates;
 *                      the acknowledgement is the record moving, and the kit
 *                      draws no pressed state for a pill that is a link in
 *                      everything but markup. `aria-current` carries which
 *                      one is the present.
 *  5. disabled       — `disabled`: every stage renders as a span, and the
 *                      current pill keeps its mango because the record is
 *                      still at that stage — the progression is not
 *                      switched off, the navigation is. Later stages already
 *                      carry the disabled ink by design.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply, deliberately. A progression drawn
 *                      before its stages arrive would state a position the
 *                      record may not be at. The caller renders a `Skeleton`
 *                      in the hero's place until the stages exist.
 *  7. empty          — `stages` of length zero renders `null`. An empty
 *                      progression rail with no stages in it is noise, and
 *                      the kit never draws one.
 *  8. error          — does not apply, and must not be faked. A BLOCKED
 *                      record is a status and belongs to the status pill
 *                      beside the title (`Badge`, ruling 26's dot plus
 *                      words); a poppy stage would put a status colour into
 *                      a position mark and break "one mango, and it is the
 *                      present". GAPS-CE STP-3.
 *  9. selected       — the current stage IS the selected one. Mango fill,
 *                      charcoal label, `aria-current="step"`.
 * 10. read-only      — every stepper without `onStageSelect` is read-only,
 *                      and that is the default. The stages become spans, so
 *                      there are no tab stops that do nothing.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED BY WIDTH, on purpose, and the header
 *  explains at length why the seven-stage fold is a count rule rather than a
 *  breakpoint. What does change with width is reflow, not drawing: the
 *  `stages` row is `flex-wrap`, exactly as `.kw-stages` is, so pills that do
 *  not fit take a second line; the `steps` rail keeps its equal columns and
 *  ellipsises the labels (`min-w-0` + `truncate`), because stacking a rail
 *  turns a stepper into a list and loses the spine that makes it readable as
 *  a progression at a glance.
 *
 * RTL — this is the component that needed the most care. The `stages` row is
 * ordered by `flex` in DOM order with no side named, so stage 01 sits at the
 * reading start in Arabic, Urdu and Persian. The `steps` connector fills in
 * READING ORDER: it is a `scaleX` and motion.css's `.motion-step-connector`
 * already flips its `transform-origin` to `100% 50%` under `[dir="rtl"]`, so
 * the rail fills the way the reader reads with nothing written here. The tick
 * glyph is not mirrored — a checkmark is a symbol, not a direction.

               3.979:1 dark against 4.5, and it stays: CH23 asks for this pair
               by name, twice. Its specimen line reads "later stages take the
               quiet fill with disabled ink", and it gives the rule its own
               heading — "Later is disabled ink, not hidden … Stages still to
               come stay visible in the quiet fill. A record that hides its
               future reads as finished, and the client cannot see what they
               are waiting for."

               The trade the artifact made, stated: a later stage is NOT a
               disabled control — it is a word ("Versand", "Erledigt") the
               client reads to learn what is coming, and CH23's own next rule
               is that the numbers are "part of the name" because "we are at
               three of seven" is the sentence a client repeats back. That
               sentence is now painted in the one tier excused from being
               legible. Ruled, recorded in GAPS-CONTRAST "Resolved", and the
               artifact's to reverse. The overflow tail below inherits it.

               AND THE EDGE IS A STROKE, NOT A DARKER FILL, 2026-09-08. The
               contrast law measured `--surface-idle` at 1.042 against
               off-beige paper in light — under its 1.05 invisibility gate —
               wherever a stepper is placed on a raised ground (the shell's
               content region, a dialog). A real finding: the pill's shape
               genuinely did not exist in light on that paper.

               THE OBVIOUS FIX WAS REJECTED BECAUSE IT MAKES A RULED NUMBER
               WORSE. CH23's specimen line says "the quiet fill", and
               `--surface-quiet` would clear the boundary at 1.339 light /
               1.324 dark — but the pair the client actually ruled on is
               GAPS-CONTRAST §2 row 8, "a later pill at 2.335:1 light /
               3.979:1 dark", and those two figures are `--ink-disabled` on
               `--surface-idle` to three decimals. On `--surface-quiet` the
               same label reads 1.817 / 2.508. Closing the boundary that way
               would darken the ground under the one word CH23 insists stays
               readable ("a record that hides its future reads as finished").

               SO THE FILL STAYS AND THE BOUNDARY IS DRAWN THE KIT'S OTHER
               SANCTIONED WAY. tokens.css forbids the `border` property
               (review 1A · fix 2) and gives an inset stroke in its place;
               `--hairline` is that stroke, and the mark two hundred lines up
               already draws its not-yet-reached state with one. The ring
               composites to 1.175 against off-beige paper in light and 1.161
               against the unlit raised paper in dark — above the law's
               hairline floor in both — while `--ink-disabled` on
               `--surface-idle` is untouched at 2.335 / 3.979.

               The law was taught the same thing at the same time: a fill
               below the boundary tier passes only if the element also draws a
               hairline that itself clears the hairline tier against that
               ground, MEASURED, not counted. See check-contrast.mjs, "A
               BOUNDARY IS A STEP OR A STROKE", and its DISCHARGES fixtures —
               four of the five assert a refusal. The pair now prints in that
               run's DISCHARGED band rather than in its findings. */
