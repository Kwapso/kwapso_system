/* ============================================================================
   DropdownMenu — the record menu (35 direct call sites).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t12.css + t12-overlaysmall.html
   (chapter 12) → `.kw-menu`, `.kw-menu__head`, `.kw-menu__item`,
   `.kw-menu__item--danger`, `.kw-keyhint`, `.kw-menu__hr`, and `.kw-eyebrow`
   from kwapso-ui.css for the head.
   Chapter 12's rule, verbatim: "Overlay shadow, 24px radius, no blur."
   Motion is motion/motion.css §4 (`.motion-anchored`, `.motion-menu-item`).
   Not shadcn. Where the two disagree, the kwapso specimen wins.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · The surface is `--popover` at `--radius` (24) under `--shadow-overlay`,
     min 264 wide, padded 10. No blur, no arrow, no border.
   · A MENU ROW IS A PILL. `--radius-pill`, 10/12 inset, 14/300 label, a 10 gap
     to its icon. This is the single most visible difference from the shadcn
     menu it replaces, which draws a 6-radius rectangle.
   · Neutral row hover is `--accent`, the kit's own active-row wash. It is NOT
     mango: `--primary` is a brand fill and would turn every menu row mango.
     The destructive row's hover is the kit's one stated menu hover, poppy at
     8%, expressed as a `color-mix` so dark re-resolves it to poppy-lift with
     no second value.
   · Disabled is a fill-less ink change to `--ink-disabled`, never an opacity —
     a menu row has no box to fill until it is hovered, so filling a dead row
     would invent a shape the kit does not draw. GAPS-A.md MNU-2.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). Radix's roving highlight moves
     `data-highlighted`, which takes the same `--accent` wash as hover, so
     keyboard and pointer agree; the RING is still the token layer's.
   · No duration, no curve, no keyframe here. `.motion-anchored` carries the
     open and close for every side; `.motion-menu-item` carries the row's fill
     swap.
   · Every string is a prop with a default.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. Radix DropdownMenu holds open state, portals, positions
   against the trigger and owns a roving tabindex.

/**
 * The menu surface, portalled and positioned against its trigger.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — `--popover` at 24 under `--shadow-overlay`, min 264,
 *                      padded 10.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply to the surface; the ROWS hover, and they
 *                      take `--accent`.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *                      The surface itself is focused on open (Radix) and is
 *                      not a `:focus-visible` target, so no ring is drawn
 *                      around the whole menu.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply to the surface.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply to the surface. A menu with nothing to
 *                      offer should not be opened; individual rows disable.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply, and it is a deliberate refusal: a menu
 *                      that opens empty and fills in moves its own rows under
 *                      the cursor, so a call site that has to fetch should
 *                      keep the trigger in `Button loading` until it can draw
 *                      the real list. Stated, not omitted. GAPS-A.md MNU-3.
 *  7. empty          — a menu with no children renders as a bare 10-padded
 *                      surface. Nothing is invented to fill it — no "No
 *                      actions" line, because that string would be a hardcoded
 *                      sentence in a component. The call site decides.
 *  8. error          — does not apply to the surface.
 *  9. selected       — belongs to `DropdownMenuCheckboxItem`, which draws a
 *                      check in a reserved slot.
 * 10. read-only      — does not apply.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED, and deliberately so. The menu is
 *  264 minimum at every width and Radix's collision handling flips its side
 *  and slides it back inside the viewport, which is a behaviour rather than a
 *  breakpoint. It does NOT become a sheet on a phone: that swap is a
 *  composition's decision (it changes which component a screen renders), and a
 *  primitive that silently turns into a different primitive cannot be reasoned
 *  about at 35 call sites. The one width-sensitive thing here is the height
 *  cap, which is Radix's measured available height and so is already correct
 *  on a short viewport.
 *
 * RTL — safe. `align` and `side` are Radix's, and Radix mirrors `start`/`end`
 * alignment with the document direction on its own. Every inset here is
 * logical.

 *                      closes; a press treatment would be seen for one frame.
 *                      Stated rather than dropped. GAPS-A.md MNU-4.

 *                      a box the kit does not draw. Not an opacity.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply to a row. A row that starts work closes
 *                      the menu and the work is reported where it happens.
 *  7. empty          — does not apply; a row with no label is a call-site bug.
 *  8. error          — does not apply. `danger` is an INTENT (this row
