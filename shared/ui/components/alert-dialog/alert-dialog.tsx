/* ============================================================================
   AlertDialog — the modal that must be answered (96 direct call sites).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-patterns.css → CH20 `.kw-scrim`,
   `.kw-modal`, `.kw-modal__title`, `.kw-modal__body`, `.kw-modal__row`.
   The kit draws ONE modal. An alert dialog is that modal with no close chip
   and a mandatory pair of answers, so this file is the same surface as
   `dialog/` with a different contract, not a second drawing.
   The two answers are `.kw-btn--primary` and `.kw-btn--cancel`, reached
   through `buttonVariants` so there is exactly one button skin in the system.
   Motion is motion/motion.css §3 (`.motion-scrim`, `.motion-dialog`).

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · Same overlay law as `dialog`: `--popover` at `--radius` (24) under
     `--shadow-overlay`, no blur, no border. GAPS-A.md OVL-1 records that the
     kit's own `.kw-modal` says `--surface-page` and the binding law says
     `--popover`.
   · NO close chip and no dismiss-on-scrim-click. That is the whole difference
     between this and `dialog`: an alert asks a question that has to be
     answered, so the only exits are the two buttons. Escape is left to Radix,
     which routes it to Cancel — a keyboard user must never be trapped.
   · A destructive answer is CHARCOAL ON POPPY, never white on red. That comes
     free from `buttonVariants({ variant: "destructive" })`; this file adds no
     colour of its own to a button.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). No ring here.
   · Every string is a prop with a default.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. Radix AlertDialog holds state, portals, and traps focus.

   item's `max-width: 100%` resolved against its own width and never bit. This
   file carried the identical positioner and the identical defect; measured at

/**
 * The alert surface. Renders its own scrim and portal.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — `--popover` at 24 under `--shadow-overlay`, 32 inset,
 *                      over the charcoal 36% scrim.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply to the surface. This file draws no
 *                      hoverable element of its own; the two answers are
 *                      Buttons and carry `--btn-*-hover`.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *                      Radix parks initial focus on Cancel, which is the safe
 *                      answer, and traps the tab ring inside.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply to the surface; the answers nudge 1
 *                      hairline, which is `button`'s behaviour.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply to the surface. An answer that must not
 *                      be taken yet is a disabled Button, which is a fill and
 *                      an ink, never an opacity.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply to the surface, and deliberately: an
 *                      alert that is committing keeps its frame and its
 *                      question, and shows the wait on the answer —
 *                      `<AlertDialogAction asChild><Button loading>…`.
 *                      Emptying the modal mid-commit would remove the sentence
 *                      the reader just agreed to.
 *  7. empty          — does not apply. An alert with no question is a bug at
 *                      the call site; Radix requires a Title regardless.
 *  8. error          — does not apply to the surface. A failed commit is
 *                      reported by an `alert` in the body or a toast, never by
 *                      recolouring the modal frame.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply.
 * 10. read-only      — does not apply.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile   — gutter drops to `--space-6` (24); `max-w-full` lets the 460
 *             surface shrink to fit, which is the kit's own `max-width: 100%`.
 *             The 32 inset inside the modal is unchanged.
 *  tablet   — gutter at the kit's `--space-7` (32) from `sm` (40rem) up; the
 *             surface reaches 460 and stops.
 *  desktop  — UNCHANGED from tablet. An alert does not widen; the shorter the
 *             measure, the faster the question is read.
 *
 * RTL — safe. Grid centring, no physical inset, no translate.

 * re-read every one of them, and end-aligned-primary-last is the web/Windows
 * convention these apps already teach their users.
 *
 * `flex-col-reverse` below the sm breakpoint puts the primary on TOP of the
