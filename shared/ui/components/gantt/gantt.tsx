   Gantt — the timeline body: one lane per app or owner, bars across periods.

   DESIGN SOURCE
   `KWAPSO-SPEC.md` CH19 view 04 (the specimen) and CH27.26 "Timeline view ·
   Sprints along a period, one lane per app" (the composition). CH27.26's own
   rules are the brief, verbatim:

       "One lane per record, always labelled — Lanes are apps, accounts or
        members, never nested groups. The label column is fixed at 132 and
        truncates with an ellipsis."

       "Bars take accents, never mango — Sky for build, forest for support,
        poppy for overrun, the same order as every chart in the kit. Type on a
        bar stays charcoal, which is why the accents were chosen: they carry
        ink at both values."

       "Length means duration — A bar spans the weeks the work actually spans,
        with a one-week floor so a short sprint stays clickable. Bars never
        stack vertically inside a lane; two overlapping sprints mean two lanes."

       "This week is marked, not centred — The current period column carries
        the emphasis; the view does not auto-scroll to keep today in the
        middle."

       "Six periods, then it steps — Six columns is the ceiling; beyond that
        the stepper moves the window rather than compressing the grid. A
        timeline never becomes a horizontal scroller inside the panel."

       "Narrow drops the grid, keeps the range — Below 720 each lane becomes a
        row: name, week range in tabular figures, and one bar with its label."

   CH27.26's drawn values, which is where the geometry comes from:
     · `grid-template-columns: minmax(96px, 132px) minmax(180px, 1fr)` — the
       label column and the track
     · `box-shadow: inset -1px 0 0 var(--hair)` — the rule between periods,
       an inset shadow, never a stroke property
     · `left: 0%  width: 34%` · `left: 36%` · `left: 68%  width: 16%` … — bars
       laid out in sixths of the track, which is the six-period ceiling
       showing up in the arithmetic

   OVERRIDE 28 (2026-08-23) — THE STEPPER SITS INSIDE THE TOOLBAR
   CH27.26 draws `‹ 6 weeks ›` inside the collection toolbar, between the
   search field and the view switch. This file used to draw it ABOVE the grid
   when handed `onPrevious`/`onNext`, and a composition that wanted the
   artifact's placement had to smuggle a stepper into the frame's `filters`
   slot. The client ruled for the artifact.

   So the DRAWING stays here — this is where CH27.26 is transcribed — and is
   exported as `GanttPeriodStepper`. The PLACEMENT moved to
   `CollectionFrame`'s new `period` slot. `Gantt` itself no longer renders a
   stepper and no longer takes `onPrevious`, `onNext`, `windowLabel`,
   `previousLabel` or `nextLabel`; a screen hands those to the stepper and the
   stepper to the frame. The consequence for the toolbar contract — that it
   CAN grow a slot — is written out in `collection-frame.tsx`, because that is
   the file the contract lives in.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · SIX PERIODS IS A CEILING, NOT A HINT. Anything past `maxPeriods` is
     dropped from the window and the stepper is the only way to see it. This
     file sets no `overflow-x` anywhere: a timeline that scrolls sideways
     inside its panel is the thing CH27.26 forbids by name.
   · A BAR IS NEVER SHORTER THAN ONE PERIOD. `span` is floored at 1 before it
     reaches the grid, so a two-day sprint is still a target.
   · BARS ARE PLACED BY GRID COLUMN, NOT BY PERCENTAGE. Same arithmetic, but
     the browser owns it, so a bar cannot drift out of register with the
     column rules behind it and the lane's height is the bar's own.
   · THE ACCENT TONES ARE `--chart-1` / `--chart-2` / `--chart-3` — sky,
     forest, poppy, in the kit's chart order. There is no fourth accent:
     `--chart-4` and `--chart-5` repeat 1 and 2 (spec, still-open register)
     and a timeline that used them would draw two tones that mean different
     things and look the same. Ink on an accent bar is `--ink-on-accent`.
   · TWO MORE FILLS EXIST, AND THEY ARE THE ARTIFACT'S OWN (client re-audit
     2026-08-26, "reference to the pdf"). CH19 view 04 — the gantt the kit
     itself draws — fills its segments five ways: Audit sky, Build MANGO,
     Validation forest, Training poppy, Refinement INK, each label at
     `seg.fg = ONACC` except ink's `ONINK`. This file used to refuse mango
     outright on CH27.26's sentence ("Bars take accents, never mango — sky
     for build, forest for support, poppy for overrun"), and the two chapters
     genuinely disagree: 27.26 rules for its three-tone key, CH19 draws five
     fills. The client's re-audit order points at the PDF, so the DRAWING'S
     two extra fills are now reachable — `tone="brand"` (mango) and
     `tone="inverse"` (charcoal), the same names `tiles` gives the same two
     fills — and nothing else moves: the default stays `build` (sky), the
     legend stays CH27.26's three-tone key, and no tone is applied by this
     file on its own. A brand bar is a MARK, not an action (override 17
     counts actions), and which records take it is the caller's data.
   · Focus is one global rule (tokens.css §8). Nothing here draws a ring, and
     nothing here clips one: no `overflow: hidden` on a lane or a track.
   · Disabled is a fill and an ink (`--btn-disabled-fill` /
     `--btn-disabled-label`), never an opacity.
   · Radii: 24 on the boxes, 4 on a bar and on a legend swatch (ruling 03 —
     "4 on a bar, a heat cell or the rotated decision node").
   · No `border` property. The period rule is `--hairline-start`.
   · rem only. Every user-facing string is a prop with a default. LTR only.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. A pressable bar and a stepper mean handlers are built during
   this module's own render.

 *  2. hover          — on a BAR that is a target, and nowhere else: the tone
 *                      keeps its fill and the bar takes `.motion-hover-lift`'s
 *                      elevation. A named shadow, never an opacity, never a
 *                      second colour — a bar whose fill changed under the
 *                      pointer would be reporting a different state.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once, at
 *                      the control's own radius, which for a bar is 4. No box
 *                      in this file clips it.
 *  4. active/pressed — a bar navigates, and the acknowledgement is the record
 *                      arriving. The stepper's own press belongs to
 *                      `GanttPeriodStepper`, which is in the toolbar.
 *  5. disabled       — per bar: `--btn-disabled-fill` / `--btn-disabled-label`,
 *                      `aria-disabled`, no hover, and no tab stop that does
 *                      nothing. A fill and an ink.
 *  6. loading        — `loading`: the busy register in place of the grid. The
 *                      lane count and the period count are both unknown before
 *                      the data lands, so there is no known shape to draw a
 *                      skeleton of — unlike a list, where the row height is
 *                      stated. Logged in GAPS-TRACK2A (GNT-6).
 *  7. empty          — no lanes, or `empty`: the quiet register. A window with
 *                      no work in it must say so; the period head alone would
 *                      read as a broken grid.
 *  8. error          — `error`: the register with a poppy dot and its own
 *                      wording. Beats empty.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. A timeline is read and pointed at; the
 *                      kit draws no selected bar, and none is invented.
 * 10. read-only      — without `onBarSelect` the whole view is read-only and
 *                      still reads completely, which is the point of it.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  · mobile (base, to 45rem / the kit's 720) — THE GRID GOES. Each lane
 *    becomes a row: the name, the period range in tabular figures, and one
 *    bar with its label. CH27.26: "The proportions go; the facts stay." The
 *    key stays drawn, because the window is still a window — and so does the
 *    stepper, in the toolbar above, where override 28 put it.
 *  · tablet (`min-[45rem]:`) — the grid, at its full width. This is the kit's
 *    own stated threshold, not a Tailwind default, so it is written as one.
 *  · desktop — unchanged in kind. More width is spent on the track; the label
 *    column stays fixed, which is what keeps the lanes readable.
 *
 * RTL — LTR only (ruling 10). Every inset is logical and the one rule between
 * periods is `--hairline-start`, which is on the inline axis.
