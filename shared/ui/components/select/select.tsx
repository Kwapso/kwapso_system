/* ============================================================================
   Select — the field that opens a list (43 direct call sites).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   The TRIGGER is a field. Chapter 9 draws it as one:
     design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t9.css → `.kw-selectwrap`,
       `.kw-selectwrap__chevron` ("the field pill with a chevron … the select
       itself is a plain .kw-field__input"), chevron at `--icon-button` on
       `--ink-secondary`, with `--space-7` of room reserved for it.
     design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-ui.css → `.kw-field__input` for the
       skin `input.tsx` already carries: 44 tall, pill, page fill, one
       hairline at `--hair-strong` (override 42), focus hairline to ink.
     design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t9-inputs.html lines 119-127 —
       the drawn specimen ("Sprint type" / "Maintenance").

   The LIST is an overlay. Chapter 12 draws every floating surface the same:
     design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t12.css → `.kw-menu`
       (`--surface-raised` at `--radius-card` under `--shadow-overlay`, padded
       `--space-2h`) and `.kw-menu__item` (a pill row, `--space-2h`/`--space-3`
       of padding, 14/300, hover on the kit's own `--accent` wash).
     Chapter rule, verbatim: "Overlay shadow, 24px radius, no blur."

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · A select trigger is a FIELD and takes the field hairline — CH09's TWO
     strengths, `--hair-strong` at rest and `--border` (8%) disabled,
     override 42 — and
     the field's 44 height. That is the deliberate distinction from a button,
     which carries no border in any state.
   · The overlay is `--radius` (24), the overlay shadow and NO blur. Menus in
     this system are paper, not glass.
   · A menu row is a pill and its hover is `--accent`, the kit's neutral row
     wash. Never `--primary`: mango is a brand fill, never a hover, or every
     menu row turns mango.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). This file moves the trigger's
     HAIRLINE to ink on focus and while open, which is a fill colour and not a
     ring, and defines no ring. Nothing here sets `outline: none` — shadcn's
     select does, on both the trigger and every item, and that is a rejection.
   · Disabled is a fill and an ink (`--hair-faint` / `--ink-disabled`), never
     an opacity.
   · Motion is attached, not written: `.motion-anchored` from motion/motion.css
     opens the list on the kit's 4px rise and closes it on a straight fade,
     and `.motion-menu-item` carries the row's colour swap. No duration is
     written in this file.

   WHY `enabled:` GUARDS THE TRIGGER'S LIVE STATES
   A Select is disabled from the ROOT (`<Select disabled>`), so the trigger's
   own props never see it — a JS-resolved state like `input.tsx`'s would miss
   it entirely. Radix does put the native `disabled` attribute on the trigger
   button, so `:enabled` and `:disabled` are mutually exclusive there and
   exactly one class set can match. Everything live is `enabled:`-guarded;
   everything dead is `disabled:`-prefixed and therefore also outranks the
   unprefixed base. The one state still resolved in JS is error, because
   `error` and `aria-invalid` are two spellings of one thing.

 *  1. default        — page fill, one hairline at `--hair-strong`, pill,
 *                      44 tall (override 42).
 *  2. hover          — does not apply. CH09 draws a field at rest, at focus
 *                      and disabled and no hover for any of them; the one
 *                      this file carried came from kwapso-ui.css. Nothing
 *                      replaces it — the next thing a trigger does is state
 *                      3, and state 3 is a real drawn move here.
 *  3. focus-visible  — the hairline goes to ink here; the RING is tokens.css §8
 *                      and this file adds none.
 *  4. active/pressed — the OPEN state, which takes the same ink hairline as
 *                      focus. A select has no separate pressed moment: the
 *                      press opens the list, and the list is the feedback.
 *  5. disabled       — `--hair-faint` fill, `--ink-disabled` label and
 *                      chevron, and the WEAK 8% edge against the resting
 *                      trigger's 20% (override 42). Set on `<Select
 *                      disabled>` or here; both reach the same skin.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply to the trigger itself. A select whose
 *                      OPTIONS have not arrived is `disabled` with the
 *                      placeholder showing; a select whose VALUE has not
 *                      arrived shows a `Skeleton` in its place, because
 *                      rendering the placeholder would say "nothing chosen",
 *                      which is an answer and a wrong one. See GAPS-B.md
 *                      SEL-5.
 *  7. empty          — the placeholder, in tertiary ink, via
 *                      `data-[placeholder]`. `SelectValue` takes the string
 *                      from the call site, so nothing here needs translating.
 *  8. error          — `error` or `aria-invalid`: poppy hairline at 65%. The
 *                      MESSAGE beside it is ink, never poppy, and belongs to
 *                      `field` (chapter 9: "error text poppy-free").
 *  9. selected       — the chosen option's text replaces the placeholder and
 *                      goes to primary ink. The trigger itself is never
 *                      "selected"; the selection lives on an item.
 * 10. read-only      — does not apply. Radix exposes none, and a value the
 *                      user may not change is `disabled` — which is exactly
 *                      how chapter 9 treats a system-set field, minus the
 *                      borderless skin a real read-only input gets.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED. `w-full` and 44 tall at every
 *  width, which is already the touch row. A select does not become a sheet on
 *  a phone in this system: Radix's native-feeling list is already
 *  touch-scrollable, and a sheet would be a second drawing of the same
 *  control. Logged as GAPS-B.md SLC-4.
 *
 * RTL — safe. `px-*` is padding-inline, the chevron — when it is drawn at all
 * — is placed by `justify-between` rather than by a side, and Radix mirrors
 * the list's alignment from `dir`.

     open OVER a dialog, because a dialog is where a form lives and a form is
     where you pick things.

     Select was the only portalled surface left under that line. Inside a
     dialog it opened BEHIND the dialog it was opened from: the list was
     painted, the options were there, and every click landed on the dialog in
     front of it. On a phone, where the list fills most of the screen, the
     effect is a form whose pickers simply do not work — reported from a
     handset with three dead pickers on one form.

     It is not a taste call and it has no downside: 70 is the layer the kit

 * One option — a label, and optionally an image OR an icon beside it.
 *
 * THE MARK SITS OUTSIDE `ItemText`, and that is load-bearing rather than
 * tidy: Radix clones `ItemText`'s children into the trigger to render the
 * chosen value. An `<img>` cloned into a 44 pill would be a second, unasked-
 * for drawing in the field. Keeping the mark a sibling means the list shows
 * the picture and the closed field shows the words.
 *
 * The chosen row is marked with a tick at the reading end, NOT with the
 * inverse fill the rest of chapter 10's family uses. A full inverse row would
 * sit on the same element as the `--accent` highlight wash and the two would
 * fight: moving the keyboard onto the already-chosen row would have to either
 * lose the selection or lose the highlight. The tick is a second channel and
 * survives both. Logged as GAPS-B.md SLC-1 — the kit draws no select list.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — pill row, 14/300, primary ink.
 *  2. hover          — `--accent`, the kit's neutral row wash. Pointer and
 *                      keyboard are one state here because Radix reports them
 *                      as one attribute, which is right: a menu has a single
 *                      "the row you are on".
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. Radix moves real DOM focus onto the row, so
 *                      tokens.css §8 rings it at its own pill radius. Nothing
 *                      in this file suppresses that, which is the one place
 *                      this component deliberately departs from shadcn.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply. The press commits the choice and
 *                      closes the list; a pressed skin would be shown for the
 *                      length of a frame.
 *  5. disabled       — `--ink-disabled`, not-allowed, and no wash. An option
 *                      that cannot be chosen still has to be readable, which
 *                      is why the row keeps its paper.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply to a row.
 *  7. empty          — does not apply. An option always carries a label; a
 *                      row with no children is a row that should not exist.
 *  8. error          — does not apply. An option cannot be invalid; the FIELD
 *                      can, and it draws that itself.
 *  9. selected       — a tick at the reading end, in primary ink. See the
 *                      note above for why this one member of the family is
 *                      not the inverse fill.
 * 10. read-only      — does not apply.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED. The row is 10 + 14 + 10 ≈ 40 tall,
 *  the kit's standing control height, at every width. It is under the 44
 *  touch row by 4; the kit draws menu rows at this density on every device
 *  and nothing here overrides it (GAPS-B.md SLC-5).
 *
 * RTL — safe. `px-*` is padding-inline, the tick is pushed out by `ms-auto`
 * (margin-inline-start), and the row's order follows the document direction.

           `object-cover`, and that is a CORRECTION rather than a preference.
           This line shipped as `object-contain` on the strength of CH27.28's
           *"Portrait assets letterbox onto paper rather than being cropped to
           fill"* — and the client overruled that sentence on 2026-09-09:
           *"everywhere for images: do fill, not fit!"*, with a wide logo
           losing its ends named as the INTENDED consequence.
           The deeper reason is that this mark was disagreeing with the kit's
           own. A record's mark is `Avatar shape="square"`, whose `AvatarImage`
           has covered since it was written, and `company-hub.tsx` draws a
           supplied company logo through exactly that. So Padelbase's logo was
           cropped in the record and letterboxed one row down in the picker
           that chooses it — the same asset, the same size, two silhouettes.
