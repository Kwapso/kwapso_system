   Notifications — CH27.34, "Notifications · A collection of sentences,
   not a bell of badges".

   ┌── IT IS A CONTROL NOW, AND IT USED TO BE A 619-LINE SCREEN ──────────────
   │ The client, 2026-08-24: "notifications is also component". So it moved
   │ from compositions/screens/ to controls/, and the thing that moved is the
   │ PANEL — what the rail's count opens — because that is the part of it that
   │ is a control.
   │
   │ WHAT WAS REMOVED, EXACTLY. The file had two branches. `surface="page"`
   │ wrapped the rows in `MainScreen` with a `rail` and a `railLabel`: that is
   │ a screen, and it is gone, along with the `surface` prop, the `rail` and
   │ `railLabel` props, and the `ShapeStateBody` registers that only the page
   │ used. `surface="panel"` was already self-contained — its own measure, its
   │ own bare frame, its own "and ends with a link" tail — and it is what is
   │ left, unchanged line for line. Nothing was invented to make this happen;
   │ one of two existing branches was deleted and the other kept.
   │
   │ THE EXPORT IS `Notifications`, not `NotificationsScreen`. A control is
   │ not a screen and the name said otherwise.
   │
   │ TWO THINGS THE CLIENT SHOULD KNOW THEY ARE OVERRIDING
   │  1. THE FULL-PAGE INBOX IS GONE. This chapter's own strapline asks for
   │     the rows "in a panel from the rail AND as a full page — same rows in
   │     both, because a person should not have to learn two inboxes." The
   │     panel survives; the full page does not. An application that wants the
   │     page renders `<Notifications panelRows={items.length} />` inside its
   │     own `MainScreen`, which is three lines and is the same rows.
   │  2. THIS CONTROL IMPORTS TWO STRUCTURES — `CollectionFrame` and
   │     `ActivityFeed`. Every other control in this folder imports only
   │     controls, so the tier ordering runs backwards here. That is not
   │     fixable by filing: 27.34 requires the log's own row component ("a
   │     second row grammar for an inbox is the exact thing the chapter
   │     forbids"), so a notifications control that draws its own rows would
   │     break the chapter to satisfy the folder. Written down, not fixed.
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   COMPOSED, NOT DRAWN
     · CollectionFrame — the panel, the heading, the count chip and the one
                         paper action. `tone="bare"`, because the popover the
                         rail opens is already the surface.
     · ToggleGroup     — the four facets. The kit's own copy for it is "two to
                         four options that change how the same data is drawn",
                         which is this row exactly. Pills, not tabs.
     · ActivityFeed    — the rows. It IS the log's row: a time, a mark, and a
                         sentence that wraps. 27.34 is the log filtered to you,
                         so it uses the log's component and not a second one.
     · Button          — "Mark all read", and the panel's "Open all".
   Not one fill, radius, type step or ring is written in this file.

   DESIGN SOURCE — KWAPSO-SPEC.md CH27, composition 27.34.

     The strapline, verbatim:
       "What the rail's count opens. It is the activity-log composition (27.9)
        filtered to things addressed to you, in a panel from the rail and as a
        full page — same rows in both, because a person should not have to
        learn two inboxes."

     "One inbox, two widths", verbatim:
       "The panel from the rail and the full page are the same rows with the
        same wording — the panel simply shows fewer and ends with a link.
        Nothing is written differently in the short version."

     "A row is a sentence, like the log", verbatim:
       "Actor, what they did, which record, and the words if it was a message.
        Notifications are the log filtered to you, so they read the same way —
        no 'new activity', no '1 update'."

     "Unread is the avatar and the ink", verbatim:
       "An unread row keeps the mango avatar and primary ink; a read one drops
        to secondary. No dots down the left, no bold-versus-regular trick, no
        blue — and the count in the rail is a mango pill on the item, not a
        floating badge."

     "Four facets, and Unread is first", verbatim:
       "Unread, Mentions, Assigned to me, All. They are pills, not tabs,
        because this is not a collection with subsets — and the count sits
        inside the Unread pill where it is being acted on."

     "Reading is not an action", verbatim:
       "Opening a row marks it read and takes you to the record. There is no
        per-row tick, no swipe-to-dismiss, and nothing is ever deleted — the
        log is the permanent copy, so an inbox needs no bin."

     "Never a toast", verbatim:
       "Notifications do not appear over the work. Nothing slides in from a
        corner, nothing steals focus; the rail count changes and that is the
        whole announcement."

     "Doors differ", verbatim:
       "The portal notifies on three things only: kwapso replied, a
        deliverable is ready to review, and we are waiting on you. No
        assignments, no mentions, no automations."

     Narrow, verbatim: "Narrow · the full page, same rows and same facets".

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · NEVER A TOAST. This file imports no toaster, mounts no `Sonner`, sets no
     timer and renders nothing positioned. There is no prop that could make it
     appear over the work. The rail's count is the announcement, and the rail
     belongs to the application shell, not to this composition.
   · NOTHING IS EVER DELETED. There is no remove handler, no per-row tick, no
     swipe and no bin on this screen or in this file's API. `onOpen` marks a
     row read and takes the reader to the record; that is the only per-row
     verb there is.
   · THE ROWS ARE THE LOG'S ROWS. `ActivityFeed` is the component 27.9 is
     built from. A second row grammar for an inbox is the exact thing the
     chapter forbids.
   · UNREAD IS THE MARK AND THE INK. Unread takes `variant="brand"` — the
     mango mark — and the sentence's default primary ink; read drops the mark
     to `quiet` and the sentence to `tone="secondary"`. No dot, no bold, no
     blue, and never an opacity.
   · FOUR FACETS, UNREAD FIRST, AND THE COUNT IS INSIDE IT. The order is fixed
     in `NOTIFICATION_FACETS` rather than passed, because the chapter states
     it as an order and not as a set.
   · ONE INBOX, ONE WORDING. The panel shows fewer of the SAME rows and ends
     with a link. There is no separate short copy: it is handed the same items
     and slices them, and `panelRows={items.length}` draws all of them.
   · NOTHING IS CENTRED. 27.37 is the only centred composition in the kit.
   · Every user-facing string is a prop. No px, no hex, no `border`.

   TWO THINGS THE ARTIFACT AND THE BUILD ONCE DISAGREED ON — BOTH NOW RULED.
   They were logged as NOT-1 and NOT-2 in GAPS-TRACK3C.md and this block
   recorded them as open. They are not open any more, and the record is
   corrected here rather than left to be "fixed" back:
     · NOT-1 · CLOSED BY OVERRIDE 17. The mango mark on every unread row was
       logged as sitting against ruling 30's "one mark per view may take
       mango". The override reads that sentence as being about *marks that
       identify a record*, which an unread flag is not, and counts ACTIONS
       rather than objects — so "27.34's unread rows each keep the mango
       mark" is now the ruled answer, not merely the newer chapter's.
     · NOT-2 · CLOSED BY OVERRIDE 18, AND THE BUILD MOVED. This block used to
       say `ActivityFeed` draws the time in the LEADING column on CH18's
       geometry. It does not: ruling R2 took CH18's `74px 24px 1fr` and built
       27.9's and 27.34's trailing time instead, `24px 1fr auto` —
       `activity-feed.tsx` draws `grid-cols-[var(--avatar-sm)_1fr_auto]`. The
       artifact and the build now AGREE, and the chapter that lost was CH18.

   NARROW (380px)
   Nothing is dropped, nothing collapses and no facet is hidden behind a
   control. `ToggleGroup` wraps rather than scrolls, so all four pills stay
   reachable with no horizontal scroll, and "Mark all read" moves under the
   heading because `CollectionFrame`'s heading row wraps. The 22.5rem measure
   — the chapter's 360 — is a MAX and not a width, so at 380 the panel simply
   fills what it is given.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. The facet handler and the per-row open handler are built
   during this module's own render.

 *  1. default        — the heading with the count, four facet pills, and the
 *                      rows grouped by day.
 *  2. hover          — the rows' (`ActivityFeed`'s `--accent` wash, and only
 *                      with `onOpen`), the pills' and the buttons'. Never
 *                      this file's, and never an opacity.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once.
 *  4. active/pressed — the controls' own.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. A notification cannot be switched off.
 *                      A reader with no rights does not reach this screen.
 *  6. loading        — `state="loading"`: the busy register; the
 *                      heading, the count and the facets stay drawn.
 *  7. empty          — `state="empty"`, or no rows: the quiet register with a
 *                      sentence naming what arrives here. The facets stay, so
 *                      a reader can see the filter is what emptied it.
 *  8. error          — `state="error"`: ruling 06's block failure.
 *  9. selected       — the chosen facet pill, owned by `ToggleGroup`.
 * 10. read-only      — the inbox itself. Reading is not an action, and
 *                      nothing here is ever deleted.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  · 380 — the full page, same rows and same facets. The pills wrap and
 *    "Mark all read" wraps under the heading. Nothing is hidden and no row is
 *    shortened.
 *  · tablet / desktop — the heading row holds its action on one line.
 *
 *  THE FEED'S GEOMETRY DOES NOT CHANGE WITH WIDTH. This block used to say the
 *  time column "goes `auto`" at 380 and aligned "at the drawn 74" above it.
 *  Override 18 removed that two-state behaviour with the column it belonged
 *  to: the feed is `24px 1fr auto` at EVERY width, the time trailing, and
 *  "the two-state breakpoint CH18's fixed column needed is gone with it".
 *
 * RTL — LTR only by client ruling. Nothing here names a side.
