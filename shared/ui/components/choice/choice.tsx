/* ============================================================================
   Choice — the selection ROW: a mark, the words beside it, and the whole
   thing clickable (0 direct call sites; reached through the screen engine).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t10.css → `.kw-choice`
     (inline-flex, centred, `--space-2h` between mark and words, body-s,
     `cursor: pointer`) and `.kw-choice--locked` / `.kw-choice--locked
     .kw-choice__label` (not-allowed across the whole row, `--ink-disabled`
     words). TWO things in that first bracket are no longer taken from
     t10.css: the `body-s`, which override 32 replaces with the field label's
     caption step (`label.tsx` supplies it), and the `--space-2h`, which
     SEL-B2 replaces with the artifact's own 12. Everything else on the line
     still holds.
   design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t10-selection.html — every mark in
     chapter 10 is drawn inside one of these rows: checkbox, radio and switch
     all appear as `<label class="kw-choice">` wrapping the control.
   The second line uses `.kw-field__help` from kwapso-ui.css (badge step,
     tertiary ink), which is the only quiet-line treatment the kit has.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · THE ROW DRAWS NO MARK AND NO FILL. It is the label side of chapter 10.
     The mark is `Checkbox`, `RadioGroupItem` or `Switch`, passed in as the
     child, and each of those already draws chapter 10's ON-STATE: an
     INVERSE fill (`--surface-inverse`) with an `--ink-on-inverse` mark, not
     kwapso-ui.css's older mango. This file adds NO second selected
     treatment — a wash behind an inverse mark would be two on-states for one
     answer, and the kit draws none. Stated again at state 9.
   · Disabled is an ink, never an opacity: the words go to `--ink-disabled`
     and the whole row takes `cursor: not-allowed`, exactly as
     `.kw-choice--locked` draws it. The mark takes its own faint fill.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). A `<label>` is not focusable;
     the ring lands on the mark inside it. Nothing here defines a ring and
     nothing sets `outline: none`.
   · Hover: the kit draws NONE on `.kw-choice` and none is invented. Logged
     as GAPS-CE CHO-3 with the reason.
   · Logical properties only. `gap` orders the row, so the mark leads on the
     reading-start side in Arabic, Urdu and Persian with nothing written.

   HOW IT SITS INSIDE `Field`
   `field.tsx` mints an id and injects `id`, `aria-describedby`,
   `aria-invalid`, `required` and `disabled` into its single child. Landing
   that `id` on this `<label>` would be wrong — the id belongs to the CONTROL
   the label names. So Choice intercepts all five, keeps `htmlFor` for itself,
   and forwards the rest to the mark, adding its own description id to the
   `aria-describedby` chain rather than replacing what Field sent:

     <Field help="Everyone on the account is notified.">
       <Choice label="Notify the account owner">
         <Checkbox />
       </Choice>
     </Field>

   A composed control whose accessible identity lives on an inner node takes
   the render-prop form, the same escape hatch `field.tsx` ships:

     <Choice label="Public status page">
       {(control) => <Switch {...control} />}
     </Choice>

   RENDERING CONTEXT

  // is drawn wider still, so 12 is the floor of the range and never above it.

/* THE WORDS ARE A FIELD LABEL — override 32, 2026-08-23, verify/open.html
   C17-1. They used to be `text-sm text-foreground`, chapter 10's `.kw-choice`
   step: 14 at weight 300, one size up and one weight down from every
   `.kw-field__label` sitting above them on the same settings panel. The
   client ruled the field label's step wins, so every checkbox, radio and
   switch row in both apps is now 13/500 and a settings screen is one type
   step top to bottom.

   THE STEP IS NOT RE-DECLARED HERE. `Label` is rendered `asChild` over the
   words, so `label.tsx` remains the only file in the system that says what a
   label is made of — which is what `label.tsx`'s own header has always
   claimed ("the field label AND the choice-row label").

   WHY `asChild` AND NOT A PLAIN `<Label>`. `LabelPrimitive.Root` renders a
   `<label>` element, and the choice ROW is already the `<label htmlFor=…>`
   that names the mark. A `<label>` may not contain another one: the HTML
   parser and the accessible-name computation both treat that as a fault, and
   the inner element would compete for the click the row exists to widen.
   `asChild` merges Radix's props onto the `<span>` below instead, so the
   component is used, the element stays a span, and nothing is duplicated.

   NOTHING IS LEFT TO WRITE. `Label` already ships the locked ink in both
   spellings (`peer-disabled` and `group-data-[disabled]`), and the row above
   is the `group`, so `.kw-choice--locked`'s disabled words come for free. It
   ships the colour transition too. This constant is therefore `Label`'s own
   list, re-exported under the name the demo's export sheet already lists, so
   that the two can never be two lists again. */

/**

 *                      primary ink, rendered through `Label` (override 32).
 *                      Chapter 10's own 14 / 300 is the stale side.
 *  2. hover          — NOT drawn, and that is the kit's drawing rather than
 *                      an omission: `.kw-choice` has no hover rule. A wash
 *                      behind the row would be a second on-state competing
 *                      with the inverse mark, and the mark's own hover (its
 *                      hairline to `--hair-strong`) already answers the
 *                      pointer. GAPS-CE CHO-3.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once
 *                      and the focusable node is the mark inside this row.
 *                      A `<label>` is not in the tab order.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply. Pressing the row presses the mark, and
 *                      a selection control's press IS its state change; the
 *                      kit draws no separate pressed skin for one.
 *  5. disabled       — `data-disabled` on the row: `cursor: not-allowed`
 *                      across the whole target and `--ink-disabled` words,
 *                      which is `.kw-choice--locked` exactly. An ink, never
 *                      an opacity. The mark takes its own faint fill.
 *  6. loading        — does not apply, and deliberately. A choice whose value
 *                      has not arrived must not render unanswered — that is a
 *                      wrong answer, not a missing one. The caller renders a
 *                      `Skeleton` in the row's place until the value exists.
 *                      Ruled once for the whole family in GAPS-B.md SEL-5.
 *  7. empty          — no `label`, no `description`, no `image` and no
 *                      `icon` renders the mark alone
 *                      rather than reserving an empty words column. No
 *                      children at all renders the words alone, which is what
 *                      a caller building a custom mark asked for.
 *  8. error          — `invalid` (or `aria-invalid`) is forwarded to the mark,
 *                      which draws chapter 9's 65% poppy hairline. The ROW
 *                      draws nothing: "error text poppy-free". The message
 *                      itself belongs to `Field`.
 *  9. selected       — belongs to the mark, and it is INVERSE:
 *                      `--surface-inverse` fill with an `--ink-on-inverse`
 *                      mark (chapter 10 over kwapso-ui.css's mango,
 *                      GAPS-B.md SEL-1). This row adds no second selected
 *                      treatment on purpose — see the header.
 * 10. read-only      — does not apply. HTML has no read-only checkbox, radio
 *                      or switch; a value the reader may not change is
 *                      `disabled`, which chapter 10 draws as "locked by
 *                      policy".
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED, and the row is the reason the kit
 *  can leave it unchanged: the mark is 22, under the 44 touch row, so chapter
 *  10 makes the WORDS part of the target instead of growing the mark on a
 *  phone. The row is `inline-flex`, so it is exactly as wide as its contents
 *  at every width and a long description wraps under the words rather than
 *  pushing the mark. A column of these takes its gap from the parent —
 *  `--space-3` (12) is what `radio-group` uses (GAPS-B.md SEL-7).
 *
 * RTL — safe. `gap` orders the row, so the mark sits at the reading start in
 * Arabic, Urdu and Persian with no rule written. No physical side is named.
