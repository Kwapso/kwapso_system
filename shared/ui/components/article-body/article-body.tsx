   DESIGN SOURCE
   Kit chapter 03 ("Typography · Saans 300 / 500 · Serrif Condensed 300 ·
   thirteen steps"), the specimen captioned "Prose block", read out of
   `Design Mothership/kit-current/Kwapso UI Kit.dc.html`. Kept figure for
   figure:

     · eyebrow   — 11 / 500 / uppercase / 0.08em, tertiary ink
     · heading   — 24 / 500 / -0.014em, 12 under the eyebrow
     · paragraph — 16 / 1.45, secondary ink, `max-width: 66ch`,
                   `text-wrap: pretty`, 10 under the heading
     · list      — 15 / 1.6, secondary ink, `max-width: 66ch`,
                   inline-start inset 20, 14 under the paragraph

   The chapter's own body-copy caption is the rule the measure comes from:
   "Body copy runs at sixteen and never exceeds sixty-eight characters a
   line." Its link caption is the rule the anchors obey: "Ink, underlined on
   hover. Never blue, never coloured." Its truncation caption settles the
   difference between this component and a row: "One line ellipsis in rows;
   wrap in prose." Nothing here truncates.

   The editorial rules the chapter states — "Bulleted lists stay short and
   parallel", "No emoji, no exclamation marks", "Numbers get tabular figures"
   — are copy decisions, not drawing decisions. Only the third one is
   something a component can enforce, and it is: every number in this
   component's prose is tabular.

   Ruling 35 governs any picture inside the prose: "Photography sits under
   type, never behind it. A header image is a contained card with 24px corners
   at the top of a page. No text is ever placed on it, and no scrim is used to
   make text survive it." So an `img` here takes the box radius and nothing is
   ever laid over it.

   Ruling 13's pull-quote is chapter 13's, and it is the one serif in the
   system: `SerrifCondensed` at the h3 step on `--tracking-serif`, "one per
   page". A `blockquote` inside the prose is drawn as that BY DEFAULT.

   THE SECOND QUOTE REGISTER — `quote="passage"`, 2026-09-07. The kit's
   law-book does not rule on quotes at all: `blockquote` appears in none of
   docs/RULES.md, PATTERN.md, BUILD-A-COMPONENT.md, BUILD-A-SCREEN.md or
   TOKENS.md, and until now this file drew every one as the pull-quote, with
   no way to opt out. The case that had no answer was logged in
   manifest.json → notDelivered: a quoted reply inside a ticket or a meeting
   note — several per page, none of them editorial — which is the ORDINARY
   shape of user-authored prose, because an editor that emits HTML emits
   `<blockquote>` for a quote a person typed mid-sentence. A pull-quote is
   the author raising their voice; a passage is somebody else's words,
   lowered. Drawing the second as the first made every quoted reply a
   headline. The register the entry recommended is built as written: sans at
   the body step, quiet ink, marked by a rule rather than by the serif, with
   the editorial pull-quote kept as the default so nothing that draws one
   today changes. Which ink and which rule were decided by measurement, at
   `PASSAGE_QUOTE` below.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · The measure is `--measure-body`, and it is capped ONCE, on the root.
     SETTLED 2026-08-23, override 31 (verify/open.html C15-2), REASON
     CORRECTED by override 37 (verify/open.html N5): the token is `66ch`,
     CH03's own drawn value. Three figures used to disagree — 68 in CH03's
     prose, 66 in CH03's own drawing, 62 in the token with a `! GAP-8` beside
     it. 66 DOES NOT SATISFY THE PROSE and no `ch` figure near it can: `ch` is
     the width of a zero, 66ch measures 88 rendered characters in this face,
     and a true 68-character cap is about 52ch. The drawn value wins because
     it is the half a stylesheet can hold; CH03's prose is the side owed a
     correction. GAP-8 stays closed and GAPS-COL1 AB-1 with it. The component
     still holds no number of its own.
   · Type is never a hardcoded size. Every step here is one of the sixteen
     bridged utilities, which set size, leading AND tracking together.
   · A link is ink, underlined, never coloured. `--hair-strong` at rest moving
     to the current ink on hover, exactly as `Button variant="text"` draws it.
   · Blocks are separated by SPACE, not by strokes. The one rule this
     component draws is an explicit `hr`, which is the author asking for one.
   · Focus is one global rule (tokens.css §8). A link inside the prose takes it.
   · No product vocabulary. This component knows about headings, paragraphs
     and lists, and nothing about what they are for.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   No `"use client"`. It forwards props and a ref, holds no state, calls no
   hook and creates no handler during its own render.

   The prose skin.

   Written as descendant selectors rather than as a set of components, because
   long-form content arrives as authored markup — a CMS field, a markdown
   render, a mail body — and a component cannot wrap elements it never sees.

   is why nothing here is exported as `ArticleParagraph`.

/* A quoted passage: somebody else's words inside the author's prose.

   NO FAMILY, NO STEP, NO MARGIN OF ITS OWN. It runs in the body's sans at
   the body's size and sits inside the flow's own 14 (`[&>*+*]`), which is
   what makes it a paragraph somebody else wrote rather than a heading the
   author raised. Several per page is the ordinary case.

   THE INK IS `--ink-tertiary` — one tier under the body's secondary, which
   is what "quiet" means on this ladder — and it is legible where it lands,
   measured off tokens.css against the darkest paper prose meets in each
   palette: 5.899 on `--surface-panel` in light and 7.928 on `--card` in
   dark, against 4.5.

   THE MARK IS A RULE IN THAT SAME INK, NOT A HAIRLINE. The natural reach is
   `--hair-strong`, the section rule's tone — and it measures 1.526 light /
   2.185 dark against a 3:1 floor for a mark that carries meaning, the
   "system's accepted failure" `permission-matrix.tsx` records and mitigates
   with a letter. A quote has no letter to mitigate with: the rule IS the
   register's whole signal, so it takes the ink and measures what the ink
   measures. `currentColor`, so the two cannot drift apart. 2 is one of
   the two widths that live off the scale as grid lines (RULES §1.2); the
   inset after it is the list's drawn 20, so a quote and a list share one
   left edge.

   AN INSET SHADOW, NOT A BORDER — CHANGED ON THE WAY IN, 2026-09-09. This
   register was written against v1.2.64, where `border-s-2 border-current`
   was the ordinary spelling for a rule. The boundary law arrived after it
   (`foundations/rules/borders.mjs`, v1.2.70): a CSS border is a finding,
   and an inset shadow is one of the three remedies it names. That is the
   whole reason for the change, and it is worth being exact about what the
   change does NOT buy — see the paragraph after next.

   THE SHAPE IS `comments.tsx`'S, which draws a quoted reply's inline-start
   rule exactly this way — `shadow-[var(--hairline-start)]` beside a logical
   inset. This one is 2px in the ink rather than 1px in `--hair`, which no
   `--hairline-*` shape holds, so it is written out the way `tabs.tsx`
   writes its own 2px inset rule (`inset 0 -0.125rem 0 var(--foreground)`)
   rather than minting a token for a single use. The inset stays `ps-5` and
   stays logical; the shadow's offset is physical, which is the same trade
   `--hairline-start` itself makes — recorded here rather than dropped,
   because the line it replaces said "logical, so it mirrors".

   NEITHER LAW READS THIS RULE, AND THE SWAP DID NOT CHANGE THAT. MEASURED,
   2026-09-09, not assumed. `borders.mjs` never saw the border: a utility
   behind an arbitrary variant (`[&_blockquote]:border-s-2`) is outside what
   it parses — the bare spelling is judged, the prefixed one is not — so
   this was found by hand and not by the gate. And `check-contrast.mjs` does
   not pick the shadow up either: `strokes read` sits at 1,239 before and
   after, and still 1,239 with the variant prefix removed, because the
   colour is `currentColor` and this law measures token VALUES against a
   ground. `border-current` had that same property, so the contrast
   argument above was never gate-checked and still is not. THAT is why
   `verify/article-quote` reads the computed `box-shadow` off a real
   document in both palettes: for this one mark the browser is the only
   instrument there is. Do not "restore" the check's silence to a claim
   that it passed. */

/**
 * Long-form written content.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — the prose, capped at the measure, secondary ink with
 *                      primary ink on the headings and the emphasis.
 *  2. hover          — belongs to the links inside it, and only to them: the
 *                      underline moves from `--hair-strong` to the current
 *                      ink. Never a colour change, never an opacity. The
 *                      article itself is not a target.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      at the control's own radius. A link inside the prose is
 *                      a real anchor and is reached and ringed already.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply. Prose is not pressed.
 *  5. disabled       — does not apply. Text cannot be unavailable; an article
 *                      the reader may not see is not rendered at all.
 *  6. loading        — `loading`: `Skeleton variant="text"`, whose last line
 *                      is short the way a last line of prose is. Cold cache
 *                      only; a warm re-fetch keeps the stale copy and marks it
 *                      busy rather than blanking a page of reading.
 *  7. empty          — no children, or `empty`: the quiet register. NOT
 *                      `null`, because an article that came back with no body
 *                      is a fact worth saying, and a page that silently lost
 *                      its middle looks broken rather than empty.
 *  8. error          — `error`: the register with a poppy dot and its own
 *                      wording. Chapter 21's rule — say what happened, then
 *                      the one next step.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply as a component state. Text selection is
 *                      the browser's and is deliberately left alone: a custom
 *                      `::selection` colour would be a fifth accent.
 * 10. read-only      — always. This component renders content and never edits
 *                      it. An editor is a `Textarea`, not an article.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  · mobile (base) — one column, full width of its parent, capped by the
 *    measure which at 320 never binds. Every block is `w-full`, including
 *    pictures and code, and `pre` scrolls horizontally on its own rather than
 *    widening the page — a long code line is the one thing in prose that
 *    cannot wrap.
 *  · tablet (`sm:`) — UNCHANGED. The measure has still not bound at 40rem
 *    with a normal page inset, so nothing would change if it were written.
 *  · desktop — UNCHANGED in rules, but this is where `--measure-body` starts
 *    doing its work: the prose stops growing and the column gutters open
 *    instead. That is the intended and only responsive behaviour, and it is a
 *    property of the token rather than of a breakpoint — which is why there
 *    is no `lg:` anywhere in this file.
 *
 * RTL — safe, and unused: the system is LTR only. The list inset is `ps-5`
 * (padding-inline-start), every margin is on the block axis, and nothing here
 * names a physical side.

    /* PROSE THAT ARRIVES AS SANITISED HTML RATHER THAN AS NODES.
       This interface extends the div props, so it has always ADVERTISED
       `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` — and the render below writes its own children
       (an eyebrow, a heading, a register, `children`), so React refused the
       combination outright: "Can only set one of `children` or
       `props.dangerouslySetInnerHTML`". The type accepted what the
       implementation could not deliver, which is the same fault `Stopwatch`
       carried at v1.2.7 with `children`.

       It matters here more than it did there. The kit's own Notes editor emits
       HTML, so a body that arrives as a string is the ORDINARY case for
       user-authored prose, not an exotic one — and the alternative a consumer
       is forced into, wrapping the string in one div, silently kills the
       vertical rhythm: every rule that spaces this prose is a DIRECT-child
       selector (`[&>*+*]`, `[&>*+:is(h2,h3)]`…), and a single wrapper leaves
       the root with one child for them to act on. Measured, not assumed: the
       wrapped render puts exactly 1 element under the root.

       So when a caller injects, the root takes the HTML and draws nothing of
       its own. No eyebrow, no heading, no register — React forbids children
       beside injected markup, and a caller supplying the whole body is not
       asking for them. Every other caller is untouched: this branch is not
       entered unless `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is actually present.

       IT ADDS NO CLASS, NO COLOUR AND NO SPACING. The prose treatment, the
       measure and the size are the same variants the normal path resolves. */
