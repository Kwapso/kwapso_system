/* ============================================================================
   TicketThread — the client-facing conversation (1 direct call site).

   A NAMING CONTRADICTION IN THE COMMISSION, LOGGED NOT RESOLVED
   Commission §11 rules: "Tiers 0–2 carry no product vocabulary. No component
   may be named or documented in terms of tickets, sprints, accounts or
   clients. `List`, not `TicketList`." Commission §7 then requires this exact
   folder and this exact export: "`ticket-thread` | `TicketThread` | the
   client-facing conversation | 1". Both sentences are the commission's.

   The export name wins, because §2 rule 2 is the delivery contract — the name
   is already written into a call site and renaming it breaks the build, which
   is the one failure this commission exists to prevent. Everything the NAME
   does not force is generic: no prop, no type, no default string and no
   comment below this block says "ticket". A message has an `author`, a
   `side`, an `internal` flag and `attachments`; it does not have a
   requester, an agent or a case. The full entry, with both sections quoted,
   is GAPS-COL3 TCK-1.

   The sheet's own comment states the governing ruling verbatim, and it
   overrides the drawn chapter:

       "Message thread — built to RULING 36, which supersedes the ch22
        drawing (the drawn specimen shows mango-right/card-left at 78% with
        no avatars; the appendix states 'where a ruling contradicts an older
        page, the ruling wins'). Ruling 36: yours-right on the charcoal fill,
        theirs-left on paper, avatars outside, 62% maximum width. Ban stands
        on tails, scrims, gradients."

   Chapter 27.10 adds the two things ruling 36 does not: the four kinds of
   thread are ONE composition ("Client ↔ team threads, internal team chat,
   the assistant, and comments on a record are the same composition with a
   different header and a different participant list"), and an internal note
   is marked in the thread rather than hidden from it.

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · NO TAILS, NO SCRIMS, NO GRADIENTS. Ruling 36 bans all three by name.
     A bubble is a paper card with the box radius, and nothing else.
   · SIDES, NOT COLOURS, CARRY AUTHORSHIP. Mine is charcoal at the inline
     end; theirs is raised paper at the inline start. Mango never appears in
     a bubble: it is the brand, never a status and never a speaker.
   · 62% MAXIMUM WIDTH, at every breakpoint. Ruling 36 states one figure and
     it is not a function of viewport width — see the breakpoint block.
   · The avatar is OUTSIDE the bubble, and it is `Avatar`, not a redrawn
     circle.
   · An empty composer sends nothing: the send control is `disabled` — a fill
     and an ink — rather than absent, so the row does not reflow as the
     reader types.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8). Nothing here sets
     `outline: none`; the composer's field carries no ring of its own and the
     shared `:focus-visible` rule lands on it at the pill radius.

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   `"use client"`. Controlled and uncontrolled composer state, a submit
   handler, and `Avatar` underneath.

 * signal this component reads (`hasByline`, gating `data-run="continued"`)
 * is built only from `author`/`authorMeta`/`time`/`internal` — never from
 * `initials`/`image` — so a caller building a run passes `author`/
 * `authorMeta`/`time` only on the LAST message and `initials`/`image` on
 * EVERY message: the byline collapses to the last bubble, the avatar does
 * not. AN EARLIER DOC HERE SAID THE OPPOSITE ("pass … `initials` only on
 * the last message of a run") and at least one caller followed it, which is
 * the exact bug the ruling reports — a run member with no byline showing no
 * avatar either. That sentence was wrong and is corrected here; it was never

/**
 * A conversation.
 *
 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — a column of bubbles, theirs at the inline start on
 *                      paper and mine at the inline end on charcoal, avatars
 *                      outside, 62% maximum width, then the composer.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply to a bubble. A message is not a target;
 *                      the kit draws no hover for `.kw-msg` and none is
 *                      invented (GAPS-COL3 TCK-3). The composer's two
 *                      controls are Buttons in everything but markup and
 *                      carry their own named hover tokens; the attachment
 *                      chip, where it is a link, takes the `--accent` wash.
 *  3. focus-visible  — NOT here. tokens.css §8 rings every control at once,
 *                      at the control's own radius. The composer is a pill
 *                      and its ring follows that; nothing here sets
 *                      `overflow: hidden`, so the ring is never shaved.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply to a bubble. The send control's press
 *                      resolves into the message appearing, which is a far
 *                      louder acknowledgement than a nudge.
 *  5. disabled       — `disabled`: the composer takes `--btn-disabled-fill` /
 *                      `--btn-disabled-label` and cannot be typed in or sent
 *                      from. A fill and an ink, never an opacity. The
 *                      messages above stay exactly as they are: a closed
 *                      conversation is still readable, and greying the
 *                      transcript would say it had been withdrawn.
 *  6. loading        — TWO different things, kept apart. The THREAD loading
 *                      is `state="loading"` and draws skeleton bubbles with
 *                      the composer kept in place. A SEND in flight is
 *                      `sending`: the field becomes non-editable and sets
 *                      `aria-busy`, and the send control shows it is busy
 *                      without the row reflowing.
 *  7. empty          — `state="empty"`, or `messages: []`: chapter 21's
 *                      register above the composer, which stays — a
 *                      conversation with nothing in it is exactly the moment
 *                      the composer matters most. When there is nothing to
 *                      say either, the register renders `null` and only the
 *                      composer is drawn.
 *  8. error          — `state="error"`: the register in its error tone,
 *                      `role="alert"`, above the composer. A failed SEND is
 *                      not this: it belongs to the call site's own notice, so
 *                      the reader's text is never thrown away by a state
 *                      change inside this component.
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. A message is not a choice. Where a
 *                      thread supports reactions or picking a message to
 *                      quote, the control is a `Button` in the message's own
 *                      `body`.
 * 10. read-only      — `composer={false}`: the transcript renders with no
 *                      composer at all, which is the honest drawing for a
 *                      conversation nobody may add to. `disabled` is the
 *                      other case — may add later, not now — and keeps the
 *                      composer visible so the reader can see that.
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile   — 62% at 320 is 198px of bubble, which is tight but is what
 *             ruling 36 states, and the ruling states ONE figure rather than
 *             a range. It is kept, for the reason `status-stepper.tsx` keeps
 *             its fold count: a width-triggered change would need a
 *             breakpoint the kit never states, and one reader on a phone and
 *             another on a laptop would be looking at two different shapes
 *             of the same conversation while talking about it. What
 *             DOES respond is the bubble's own text, which wraps, and the
 *             composer, whose attach control drops out of the row before the
 *             field becomes unusable — it is reachable from the message's own
 *             attachment list, which the field is not.
 *  tablet   — unchanged.
 *  desktop  — unchanged. The thread fills the column it is given and the
 *             62% is measured against that column, not against the viewport,
 *             so a thread in a narrow panel on a wide screen is still
 *             correct without a media query.
 *
 * RTL — safe, and this is the component where the sides matter most. `mine`
 * is `self-end` and `theirs` is `self-start`, both LOGICAL, so in Arabic,
 * Urdu and Persian the reader's own messages sit on the reading end exactly
 * as they do in English. The avatar is placed by `flex-row-reverse`, which
 * mirrors with the writing direction rather than naming a side. The receipt
 * is `self-end` with a logical `pe-*`. No physical side appears in this file.
