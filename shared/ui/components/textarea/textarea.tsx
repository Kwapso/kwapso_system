/* ============================================================================
   Textarea — the multi-line field (12 direct call sites).

   DESIGN SOURCE
   design-mothership/specimens/kwapso-ui.css → `textarea.kw-field__input`
     (height auto · min-height 6rem · padding-block `--space-3` ·
      `--radius-card` · resize vertical), on top of the `.kw-field__input`
      skin `input.tsx` already carries.
   design-mothership/specimens/_fragments/t9.css → `.kw-textbox__area`
     (the body is the 14 control step on `--leading-normal`, tertiary ink
      placeholder) and `.kw-textbox` (chapter 9: "the one 24px-radius shell
      in the chapter").

   THE LAW THIS FILE OBEYS
   · This is the ONE field that is a box and not a pill. `input.tsx` says so
     in its own header — "the 24 radius belongs to textarea, not here" — and
     this file is the other half of that sentence.
   · One 1px hairline, drawn as an INSET SHADOW and never as a `border`
     property (review 1A · fix 2). Form fields are one of the blessed places a
     hairline is allowed at all; a button still has none. CH09 states TWO
     strengths for it — `--hair2` (20%) at rest, `--hair` (8%) disabled — and
     override 42 puts them back the way the artifact draws them.
   · There is no hover, and nothing replaces it. Override 42.
   · THE EDGE IS NOT CONFORMANT AT EITHER STRENGTH. 1.526 : 1 light against
     WCAG 1.4.11's 3 : 1 for a control boundary; 3 : 1 needs about 47% ink,
     which is a border. Override 42 answers rest-versus-disabled, not that.
   · Focus is ONE global rule (tokens.css §8) and this file adds nothing to
     it — see review 1A · fix 4, and `input.tsx` for the same note.
     Chapter 9's additional "10% ink halo" is deliberately not drawn, for the
     same reason `input.tsx` does not draw it — see GAPS.md INP-1.
   · Disabled is a fill and an ink (`--hair-faint` / `--ink-disabled`), never
     an opacity, and it keeps the 8% edge — a step DOWN from the resting
     field's 20%, which is what tells the two apart.
   · Read-only loses its edge ENTIRELY, and is not tabbable (review 1A ·
     fix 5) — a system-set value is not a field
     you failed to edit.
   · The placeholder is tertiary ink (`--muted-foreground`); ruling 27 folded
     the old hint tier into it.

   WHY THE STATE IS A cva VARIANT AND NOT A STACK OF `disabled:` UTILITIES
   Identical to `input.tsx`, and for the identical reason: `disabled:shadow-x`,
   `[readonly]:shadow-y` and `aria-invalid:shadow-z` carry the same CSS
   specificity, so which one paints would be decided by the order Tailwind
   happens to emit them in. Resolved once, in JS:

     disabled  >  read-only (and loading)  >  error  >  default

   RENDERING CONTEXT
   No `"use client"`. No hook, no state, no browser API, no event handler.

 * TEN STATES
 *  1. default        — page fill, one hairline at `--hair-strong`, the 24 box
 *                      radius.
 *  2. hover          — does not apply. The artifact draws no hover on a field
 *                      in CH09; the one this file carried came from
 *                      kwapso-ui.css (override 42). Nothing replaces it — the
 *                      next thing a field does is state 3.
 *  3. focus-visible  — the RING and nothing else; tokens.css §8
 *                      and this file adds none.
 *  4. active/pressed — does not apply. A text field is not pressed; the
 *                      equivalent moment is focus, which is state 3.
 *  5. disabled       — `--hair-faint` fill, `--ink-disabled` ink, the WEAK 8%
 *                      edge against the resting field's 20% (override 42),
 *                      resize handle withdrawn.
 *  6. loading        — `loading`: read-only skin, non-editable, `aria-busy`.
 *  7. empty          — the placeholder, in tertiary ink. An empty field draws
 *                      nothing else; it is not an error until it is submitted.
 *  8. error          — `error` or `aria-invalid`: poppy hairline at 65%. The
 *                      MESSAGE beside it is ink, never poppy, and belongs to
 *                      `field`, not here (chapter 9: "error text poppy-free").
 *  9. selected       — does not apply. There is no selected text field; it is
 *                      focused (state 3) or it is not. Text selection inside
 *                      it is the platform's, and the kit does not restyle it.
 * 10. read-only      — `readOnly`: the edge goes away entirely, faint fill,
 *                      no resize handle, and out of the tab order (fix 5).
 *
 * THREE BREAKPOINTS
 *  mobile / tablet / desktop — UNCHANGED. `w-full` and 96 min-tall at every
 *  width; the field inherits its column from the parent. The one responsive
 *  move in this chapter is the FORM's — one column below 48rem, two above,
 *  never three — and a textarea normally takes `.kw-form__full`, which is the
 *  form shell's decision and not this component's (GAPS.md INP-4).
 *
 * RTL — safe. `px-*`/`py-*` are padding-inline and padding-block; no side is
 * named. The value's own direction follows the document, and the browser puts
 * the resize grip on the reading-end corner by itself.
 *
 * NOT HERE — the character counter. Chapter 9 draws the textarea inside a
 * `.kw-textbox` shell whose footer carries the helper line and a tabular
 * "96 / 400" count in disabled ink. That shell is a composition of a field, a
 * hint and a count; it belongs to `field`, which has 154 call sites of its
 * own. See GAPS-B.md TXA-1.

     * Root cause was `scrollHeight` counting the PLACEHOLDER's own rendered
     * box: `el.value` is `""`, but the browser still lays out and wraps the
     * placeholder text inside the field to compute layout, and at a narrow
     * width "Ask about your work" wraps to two lines — `scrollHeight` then
     * reports two line-heights before a single character has been typed, so
     * `grown` flips true off ghost text alone (the pill steps to the box
     * radius, the field opens two rows tall, and the caret on focus lands at
     * the top of what reads as a broken, already-multiline control — the
     * same fault, not a second one). Content the field does not hold must
     * not size it, so `el.value.length === 0` short-circuits the measurement
