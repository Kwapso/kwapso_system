// WHAT HANGS OFF ONE RECORD — the one registry behind every tab badge that is
// NOT the record's own read.
//
// THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. A record's collection tabs were badged from a sidecar
// cache key (`total:<prefix>:<recordId>`) that only the tab PANEL's own list
// fetch ever primed. `useCachedValue` is a pure cache read — it never fetches —
// so until you clicked the tab the sidecar was empty, `formatCount` rendered
// nothing, and an unopened tab looked exactly like an empty one. The owner's
// sentence: "until I don't click on the tab, I am always assuming that there is
// no information in that tab because there's no badge count." Contacts was the
// control case that proved it: its total rides the record's own read, so it was
// there on arrival while Apps, Sprints and To-dos beside it were blank.
//
// THE FIX IS HIS: fetch the COUNTS eagerly, keep the ROWS lazy. This registry is
// the counts half — one bounded door per worker returning every child total for
// one record in one round trip, primed into THE SAME sidecar keys the badges
// already read, so the badge code barely changes and no second counting path
// exists for R16 to have to arbitrate.
//
// IT IS SHARED BECAUSE THREE SURFACES HAVE TO AGREE ABOUT THE SAME LIST:
//
//   • the DOORS (workers/tenancy + workers/content) decide which figures they
//     owe and which module's read right each one costs (R18: a cross-module read
//     carries the CALLER'S rights, section by section — never one right standing
//     in for five);
//   • the SCREEN decides which doors to ask and where to park each answer;
//   • the LIVE layer decides which pings move which record's counts (R15) — a
//     count that never invalidates is worse than a blank one, because a blank
//     badge looks unloaded and a stale badge looks right.
//
// Three hand-written copies of one list is how two of them come to disagree, and
// R8's whole sentence is that a badge's collection is DERIVED rather than
// hand-listed. So it is written once, here, and every surface reads it.
//
// NOTHING HERE COUNTS ANYTHING. `key` names the sidecar and `module` names the
// gate; the arithmetic stays in the module's own existing `count*` function, so
// "12 sprints" on the tab and "12" in the list can never be two expressions that
// happen to agree.

/** One collection hanging off one record.
 *
 * `key` is the `totalKey()` PREFIX its badge reads — the same string the tab
 * panel's own fetch primes when you eventually open it, which is what makes the
 * eager count and the lazy rows land in one place instead of two.
 *
 * `module` is the read right this figure costs, and it is per-COLLECTION rather
 * than per-door on purpose (R18). Gating a whole record's counts on one module
 * would either hand somebody a number they may not see or hide one they may:
 * gate an app's counts on `work` and a support manager loses the ticket badge;
 * gate them on `help` and a delivery lead loses the sprint one.
 *
 * `resource` is the live-channel resource whose pings move this figure (R15).
 *
 * `door` is the worker that owns the counting function. It is a fact about the
 * CODE, not about the data — every team's rows live in one database — and it is
 * here because a domain worker binds only AUTH and REALTIME, so neither can
 * answer for the other's modules without a second implementation of its counts. */

 * logged against, so the prefix has to be built at runtime from whichever record
 * it is hung on. Written once, and the registry lines below are built from it, so

/** THE RECORDS WITH CHILD COLLECTIONS, keyed by the TABLE their screen is about
 * — the same word the activity feed and the live registry already use for a

 *
 * `accounts` carries the union of what a COMPANY's screen shows (apps, sprints,
 * to-dos, the rate card) and what a PERSON's shows (to-dos, tickets, meetings):
 * one table underneath, two screens on top (account-detail.tsx hands an
 * individual to contact-detail.tsx), and one key for one table is what keeps
 * this a registry rather than a list of screens. The union is not the waste it
 * looks like — the door skips any collection whose module the caller cannot
 * read, so a developer without `help:read` never pays for the ticket count.
 *
 * A record whose every badge already rides its own read is deliberately ABSENT:
 * a role and a source (activity only, and the activity total comes back with the
 * feed); a process map (its steps, versions and conversation all ride the
 * record's own door). Adding them here would buy a round trip and change no
 * badge.
 *
 * A STORY, A TICKET, A TASK AND A MEETING WERE ON THAT ABSENT LIST UNTIL
 * 2026-08-18, and the reason given for the story was simply false: "its Time tab
 * fetches at the top of the screen because the header timer needs it anyway".
 * The header asks for the caller's RUNNING timers, which is a different question
 * from how many entries sit against this record — nothing on any of those four
 * screens fetched the Time badge, so all four were blank until the tab was
 * clicked, which is the exact bug this file exists to have ended. It survived
 * because the check over it filtered candidate badges with `includes("total")`
 * and the builder is spelled `workLogsTotalKey`, with a capital T. */
