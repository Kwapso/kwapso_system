// STATUS → COLOUR, for the two record types whose lifecycle is more than a
// single open/closed switch: the ticket (seven stages) and the story (four).
//
// CLIENT RULING, 2026-08-31, verbatim: "the status scheme is not only for
// tickets, identify everywhere where there are status and we need to map
// colors." `shared/app-stages.ts` already answered this for an app's eight
// stages; this file is the same answer for the other two multi-stage
// lifecycles, kept beside neither `types.ts` (which knows nothing of `Badge`)
// nor the stepper components (which draw the TRACK, not the header chip).
//
// THE SIX TONES ARE `Badge`'s OWN (shared/ui/components/badge/badge.tsx) —
// `shipped`, `building`, `review`, `blocked`, `archived`, `done` — never an
// invented seventh (R32, the closed palette). Two of the six render the exact
// same colour (`--dot-shipped` / `--dot-done` both resolve to the forest
// green — badge.tsx's own DOT_FILL), so the split between them here is a
// NAMING one: `shipped` means the record's lifecycle has reached its final,
// closed-out state; `done` means the work itself is finished but the record
// is not yet closed (a ticket with every story done, waiting to be told to
// the client — the reviewer has not pressed the last button yet). That is the
// same reading `shared/app-stages.ts` gives its own two greens: "Completed"
// (closed) is `shipped`; "Maintenance" (still live, still healthy) is `done`.
//
// THE TIERING IS THE SAME SHAPE AS APP-STAGES.TS, READ ACROSS BOTH TRACKS:
//   archived  — nothing has happened yet (App's "Not started"; a ticket just
//               raised and unread; a story nobody has picked up).
//   review    — a person needs to look at it, or has just started to (App's
//               "Blueprint", still being scoped; a ticket somebody has read
//               but not yet scheduled; a story somebody has asked to be
//               reviewed — the literal name match is not a coincidence).
//   building  — work is actively under way (App's Development/Documentation/
//               Iteration; a ticket that is booked in or has a timer running;
//               a story with a timer on it).
//   done      — the work is finished but the record itself is not closed yet
//               (App's "Maintenance" — live and stable; a ticket whose every
//               story closed but nobody has told the client).
//   shipped   — closed out, successfully (App's "Completed"; a ticket that
//               has been answered; a story the reviewer signed off).
//   blocked   — stuck on somebody OUTSIDE the team, and the one tone this
//               file uses that app-stages.ts never needed, because an app
//               has nobody to wait on but the team itself.
//
// `awaiting_validation` IS `blocked`, NOT INVENTED — it is the client portal's
// OWN existing ruling for this exact status, reused rather than duplicated
// with a different answer: `web-portal/components/ticket-row.tsx`'s
// `STATUS_WORDS` already singles this one stage out with its own distinct
// colour ("warning", which resolves to the same poppy `blocked` draws — the
// kit's palette holds no amber, badge.tsx's own note), with the reason
// written beside it: "the one state where nothing moves until the person
// reading the screen does something." That is what `blocked` means
// everywhere else in this file's tiering, so the two front doors agree about
// this stage without a shared import between them (the portal's copy is
// client-facing words over the same seven-value enum; this file is the
// agency's own words over it, so they stay two files on purpose — R21's
// account-fence reason: no code path may cross the portal/agency line).
