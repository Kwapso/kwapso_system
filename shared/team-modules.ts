  // carries the account fence.
  //
  // `commercials` covered the two rate cards and the margin, and then the client
  // rate card too; all three were retired on 10 Sep 2026. What it covers now is
  // WHAT AN APP GIVES BACK, PRICED — one read door, agency-only. It is AGENCY

  processes: "Processes",

  // handover doc, an API reference, a recorded walkthrough, an SOP — and this
  // right is what decides whether a role may see the shelf and add to it.
  //
  // IT IS THE AGENCY'S SIDE OF THE FENCE TODAY, deliberately. The material is
  // FOR the client and every row carries their account id, so the fence is
  // there and correct; what is not there is a portal door, and nothing in the
  // client portal names this module. Every door on it refuses a client login at
  // the door (R21), the way the knowledge base's do — the decision to show a

  // assignee or a date (SCOPE ch.06) — so no client login holds it and every

  // still `work`'s decision.
  all_tasks: "Everyone's tasks",
  // TO-DOS — the one part of the work engine a client login can WRITE to, which
  // is exactly why it is its own module and not four more rights on `work`. A

  // (SCOPE ch.06, one of the six things a contact can do), so an owner grants
  // `todos: read + edit` to their Client role and grants nothing else.

  // MEETINGS. A record of a conversation — when it was, why we met, what was on
  // the agenda and what was decided. AGENCY material: the notes are ours, taken
  // for us, and often about the client rather than for them, so every door on it
  // refuses a client login the way the work engine's do. Its `delete` is the

  // account fence, and every door on them refuses a client login the way
  // `knowledge` does.
  //
  // Several of the legacy tables are NOT here, on purpose. `departments` (8 rows)
  // and `channels` (6) are bare labels with no fields of their own, and the base
  // already has exactly one home for a team's editable vocabulary — the dropdown
  // values module, which carries its own permissions, screen, import, export and
  // machine tools. Giving each of them a table, a screen and a permission row
  // would be a module built to hold a word. `content` (marketing posts) and the
  // learning library were purged outright on 17 Aug 2026, and `program` went the
  // same day with its ten rows folded onto the sprint type, which had always been
  // the same idea under a second name (team-schema 0025).

  delivery: "Meeting purposes",

  // What each right MEANS here, because three of these four are not the usual

  //   read   — see your own connections, and read what you have shared through
  //            them (files in the folders you named, mail with a known contact,
  //            your calendar, the spaces you named);
  //   create — CONNECT a Google account, and name a folder or a space for it;
  //   edit   — write back through a connection: put a file in a folder you
  //            named, leave a draft in your own Gmail, post in a space you named;
  //   delete — disconnect an account, or take a folder or space away again.
  //
  // The two acts that reach OUTSIDE the world you connected — mail that actually
  // leaves, and an event that lands in a calendar — are the owner's two extra
  // switches and live in their own modules below. Only `create` is read on
  // either: the module IS the switch. A space post is not a third switch because
  // the owner named two, and a space is one you named yourself; it sits under
  // `edit` with the other writes.

/** WHICH OF THE FOUR A MODULE ACTUALLY OFFERS (R36).
 *
 * The matrix is a grid, so every module gets four boxes whether or not four
 * decisions exist behind them. On 21 Aug 2026 fifteen of the eighty-eight
 * boxes decided nothing — a switch somebody could tick, save, and believe they
 * had granted something by. Eight of those were deliberate and documented in
 * this file; seven were not, and nothing anywhere said which was which.
 *
 * So the offered set is DATA, and `web/test/rules.test.ts` derives the
 * consulted set off the source and fails BOTH ways: a right offered here that
 * no door, tool gate, activity map or import target asks for, and a right
 * something asks for that is not offered here. The second half is the one that
 * matters — it is what stops a door being written against a right no role can
 * ever hold.
 *
 * A module absent from this map offers all four. Only the exceptions are here,
 * so the list can only shrink as doors get written.
 *
 * THE PROP LANDED, AND THE GRID TURNED UNDER IT — both on 2026-09-09, and the
 * two have to be read together.
 *
 * This note used to say the library's matrix "renders a fixed four columns" and
 * that hiding a box per row "needs a `rights?: Right[]` on that contract, which
 * is a library change and this repo does not fork the library." The library
 * change LANDED: kit v1.2.72 ships `PermissionModule.rights` — "an unoffered box
 * stops pretending to be a switch" — and an unoffered slot keeps its place and
 * loses its control: no well, no letter, an em dash, no tab stop, no tooltip,
 * and it is never counted as held whatever the stored sheet says.
 *
 * THE SAME DAY, THE SCREEN THAT WOULD HAVE USED IT WAS REPLACED. The client
 * asked for every role on ONE grid, roles down the side and these modules
 * across (web/components/team/roles-matrix.tsx), which is the TRANSPOSE of the
 * kit's own axes — and `rights` sits on the kit's ROW. Whether a module offers
 * `delete` is a fact about the module, and the module is now the COLUMN, so the
 * prop cannot say it. The grid is therefore STILL one line behind this map, for
 * a different reason than before and with a different fix: not "a library change
 * nobody has made" but "`rights` on `PermissionRole` too, or an `orientation` on
 * the matrix". The matrix file's own header carries the ask.
 *
 * Nothing is mis-granted in the meantime, which is why this is a legibility
 * defect and not a security one: an unoffered right is one no door reads, the
 * screen never draws it held, and a press on it writes nothing. */
