// WHAT A TICKET NEEDS BEFORE IT CAN BE TRIAGED — one definition, read by the
// door that refuses and by the screen that explains.
//
// THE RULING (owner, 19 Aug 2026): "A ticket must always be linked to a client
// or app before being triaged. If that is not the case, then let it be in a
// pre-triage or draft state. Only when I assign it a client app and who made the
// ticket, and all of the fields that are already required, can it go into a
// triage state."
//
// SO `new` IS THE PRE-TRIAGE STATE, and no new status was added. `new` has
// always meant "raised, and nobody has read it yet", which is the same sentence
// as "pre-triage" — a `draft` beside it would be two names for one place, and
// every screen, filter, digest and machine tool that knows about `new` would
// have to learn the second one. What was missing was never a state: it was a
// REASON. A ticket sat at `new` and nothing said why it could not move, so the
// gate reports its gaps rather than just refusing.
//
// WHY THERE IS NO EXEMPTION FOR THE AGENCY'S OWN WORK. An earlier draft of this
// rule let a ticket with no client through on the grounds that our own
// housekeeping belongs to nobody. That was unenforceable: a ticket that is
// deliberately ours and a ticket where somebody forgot to say whose are the SAME
// ROW — both simply have no client (workers/content/src/lib/help.ts, on
// `accountForStaffTicket`: "correct for the agency's own internal questions, and
// silently wrong for everything else"). An exemption anybody can claim by
// leaving a field blank is not a rule. The owner closed it the other way: every
// ticket names a client, ours included.
//
// IT IS NOT A VALIDATION AT THE DOOR THAT CREATES A TICKET, deliberately. A
// person raising a request should not have to know which app it is about — that
// is precisely the judgement triage exists to make. So the fields stay optional
// on the way IN and become required on the way THROUGH.
