// WHAT AN EXTRACTION PROPOSES — the shape of a draft process map, shared by the
// worker that writes it and the screen that reviews it.
//
// THE DRAFT IS NOT THE RECORD. That sentence is the whole reason this file
// exists as a payload shape rather than as rows: with eleven proposed steps and
// nobody having touched anything, what is on the client's record is NOTHING.
// A draft normalised into `process_steps` would be indistinguishable from the
// map the moment anybody read it slightly wrong — a screen that forgot one
// `WHERE`, an export, a savings roll-up — and a client would be shown a figure
// derived from words a model put in their mouth. So a proposal lives in ONE
// JSON column of ONE table (`process_drafts.payload`, migration 0054) until a
// person applies it, and applying goes through the map's OWN doors.
//
// THERE ARE NO USER-VISIBLE SENTENCES IN THIS FILE, deliberately. Both front
// doors import it, so R28 walks it, and a sentence declared at module level
// cannot be wrapped in `t(...)` where it is written (`t` is a hook). Every word
// a person reads about a draft is written at the screen.
//
// THE KEYS ARE THE DRAFT'S OWN. A proposed step is named by a `key` this
// extraction minted, never by a `step_key` from the map — a proposal has no
// place in the map's identity space until somebody agrees to it. A proposal that
// REVISES an existing step carries that step's real id in `revisesStepId`, which
// is the one crossing point, and it is a single named field rather than an
// ambiguity spread across the shape.
