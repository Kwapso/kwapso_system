// THE ONE SCANNER BEHIND THE SEAM SUITES — R1 (every mutation publishes), R10
// (every write gates) and the activity seam (every mutation leaves a trail).
//
// A TEST module. Nothing in any worker's src/ imports it, and wrangler bundles
// from src/, so it never ships. It lives in shared/rules/ because that is where
// the law machinery lives: registry.ts is the laws as DATA, this is the two
// oldest laws as CODE.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. The per-worker suites were copies. Not "similar" — copies:
// content and data-ops were 97% identical, and each publish-seam.test.ts also
// carried a SECOND, WEAKER gating check beside the real one, so R10 was
// enforced twice per worker with two different regexes. The weaker one had no
// comment stripping and no leading word boundary, which meant `ungatedBody(`
// read as a present gate and a doc comment thirty lines below a handler could
// satisfy a rule the handler broke. Three copies of a security check is not
// three checks; it is one check and two things that look like it.
//
// So: one implementation, and the per-worker files carry only what is genuinely
// per-worker — the reviewed deny-lists, each entry a conscious line with a
// reason. That data stays beside the worker it describes, because that is what
// a reviewer reads.
//
// The file-reading it stands on — the directory walk and stripComments — lives in
// source-scan.ts beside this file, shared with every other law that reads source.
//
// It reads handler SOURCE off disk rather than calling anything, on purpose: a
// gate that is present in the code is the only kind that can be proved without
// running the whole worker, and a mutation that "forgets" to publish is invisible
// to any behavioural test that doesn't already know what it forgot.

 * gated()/gatedBody() wrappers, requireAnyImportRight, or adminGuard — unless it
 * is a reviewed IDENTITY-gated write, which gates on whoAmI and proves ownership
 * itself. Those can't ask "does your ROLE allow this?" because the answer is
 * about WHO you are, not what you may do (teamless onboarding, an own-pointer
 * flip, accepting an invite addressed to you).
 *
 * `identityGated` maps route → the reason. Adding a line is a conscious decision
 * — that is the point: you cannot dodge the gate by quietly listing a route as
 * an exception without saying why.
 *
 * `gates` overrides the permission vocabulary for a surface whose gates are a
 * different KIND of question. The five domain workers ask "does your role allow
 * this?" (requireRight and friends). The two surfaces in front of them ask "who
 * are you?" and nothing else — mcp verifies a bearer token or the session user,
 * auth verifies a session, an internal key or a throttle bucket, because on the
 * sign-in doors there is no caller yet to have a role. Overriding the WORDS
 * keeps the SCAN shared, which is the half that matters: mcp used to hand-roll
 * its own switch parser and its own regex, and a private copy of a security
 * check is one that quietly stops being the check.
 *
 * `openRoutes` are the doors that verify NOTHING, each with the reason — a
 * health probe, a sign-in door that is the front of the building. They are held
 * to the same standard as every other register here: the route must exist, the
 * reason must be real, and (the ratchet) a route that has since GAINED a gate
 * must lose its line, so the list can only shrink.
