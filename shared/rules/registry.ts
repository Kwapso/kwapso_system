/** ── WHOSE BOOK IS THIS? THE NUMBERS ARE NOT UNIQUE ACROSS THE ESTATE ────────
 *
 * THE OWNER, 26 Aug 2026, on the collision a review round surfaced: "pick the
 * law that overrides the other. The one that is the most recent and makes more
 * sense in the broader context, you figure out what."
 *
 * The ruling, and it is a governance decision rather than a fix:
 * **`alaap-swift-struck/brimba`'s R-series is canonical. This repository's is
 * the divergent one.** Two reasons, and they agree:
 *
 *   • MOST RECENT. The newest law either repository holds is brimba's R26
 *     (`fork-sweep-complete`, 25 Aug 2026). Every law of ours that competes with
 *     a brimba number was written on 10–12 Aug, before the divergence was
 *     visible to anybody.
 *   • BROADER CONTEXT. brimba is the base a future product FORKS. Its R-series
 *     travels into every app built on it; ours travels nowhere. When one of two
 *     namespaces has to yield, it is the one with a single reader.
 *
 * WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG, which is bigger than the R26 that was reported. The
 * two books forked their numbering at R20 and both kept minting: SEVEN ids
 * (R20–R26) carry a completely different law in each repository, and we hold
 * eleven more (R27–R37) that brimba will mint over the top of the moment it
 * writes its twenty-seventh law. One collision was the visible edge of a
 * divergent series.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT BEING DONE, and why it is a decision and not an omission.
 * Renumbering our seven would rewrite 847 references across the source, the
 * docs and the tests — a change with no user, no behaviour and real risk, on a
 * repository that shares no build with brimba and goes red for none of this.
 * The harm is not to a build; it is to a PERSON who reads "R24" and cannot tell
 * which book it came from. So the cure is to make the book say so, and to make
 * the NEXT collision impossible, which is the only harm still in front of us.
 *
 * `LAW_ID_ORIGIN` below is that record, and the check on it is the guard. */

    why: "AMENDED 2026-08-14, and the amendment is narrower than 'allow an approximate count'. An unbounded COUNT(*) over a growing table was the one read in the product with no ceiling at all, on every page of every paged screen — while the exactness it bought above a thousand was precision the badge threw away immediately (24,011 and 24,499 both render '24k'). TWO OPTIONS WERE ARGUED. (b) keep the count exact and cache it briefly was the more obvious one and it LOST, for two reasons. First, a cache fights a mechanism that already exists: app-shell.tsx bumps the primed total sidecar by ±1 on every add/remove ping, so a 60-second server cache would be overwritten back to the stale value by the next list fetch — create a ticket and the badge goes 222 to 223, then jumps BACK to 222 for a minute, and a badge that moves backwards is worse than one that says 'at least'. Invalidation does not rescue it: the mutation runs in a different isolate from the one holding the cache, so cross-isolate invalidation costs a Durable Object round trip on every count read, which is MORE work than today. Second, the cache key would have to be the CALLER'S FENCE, not the collection — these counts vary with module rights (R18), the account fence, ticketFence, ownerClause — so keyed by collection it discloses one caller's count to another, and keyed correctly it fragments until the hit rate stops being the win. So (a), capped — at 1,000,000 rather than the 50,000 first proposed, because at 100,000 rows a badge reading '50k+' tells a manager LESS than '100k' does, and deliberately the SAME number as the search ceiling so the app has one place where counting stops rather than two. It can only ever do LESS work than before (the inner LIMIT stops a scan that previously ran to the end), which was the owner's condition, met by construction. Measured, not assumed: on 14 Aug 2026 the largest collection in the app is the activity feed at 2,253 rows, about 400x under the ceiling, so no screen renders differently today. Honest limitation: a bounded million-row scan is a CEILING, not a cheap query — a constant-time count needs a counter maintained by every write, named and not taken.",

What an hour of our own work costs (internal_rates) and the margin computed from it live in ONE file, workers/tenancy/src/lib/internal-money.ts, and every door that calls into it refuses a portal caller. The check derives the internal doors from that file's own exports and each handler's source, then asserts three things the portal cannot then get around: none of those doors is on the portal gateway's surface, every one of them opens with refusePortalCaller, and no file in web-portal/ names the internal table, the internal doors' paths or a margin field. SCOPE's ruling is absolute — internal rates and margin never render in the portal under any flag, ever: not behind a permission, not behind a feature toggle, not for an admin viewing the portal — and the instruction with it was to make that structurally true rather than a condition somebody can invert later. A condition can be inverted and a permission can be granted; an import cannot be forgotten. The account rate card — what a client IS charged, which they may be shown when their price visibility is on — is a SEPARATE file and a separate table for exactly this reason: two numbers of identical shape and opposite audiences must not share a WHERE clause. AND THE OUTBOUND HALF, added 2026-09-05: a conversation that has READ an internal number may not then WRITE to a door the client's own browser opens. The three clauses above are all about the import graph, and the assistant does not need one — it reads the margin through a door R24 fences correctly, as an agency admin holding commercials:read, and then replies into a ticket thread the client reads. Nothing was forgotten and nothing was inverted; every door did its own job and the figure still arrived in the client's inbox, with no confirm panel anywhere on the path, because reply_help_ticket is gated on help:read and confirms only when it @mentions somebody. The instruction that reached the model came from the client themselves: a portal ticket description is 20,000 characters of their prose, read by the assistant the next time anybody here asks a question about tickets. So the fourth clause is a per-turn taint refused at the step, before the door is called, and BOTH ITS SETS ARE DERIVED — the money doors from internal-money.ts's own exports through tenancy's own ROUTES (the same walk clause 1 makes), the client-readable doors from the non-GET half of PORTAL_DOORS, and the TOOLS from those doors off the shipped catalogue at load time, so a money tool added tomorrow on an existing door is covered the moment it exists. It refuses BEFORE it defers: a confirm ends the turn and confirmAndRun resumes from a stored row that remembers nothing, so a proposal is judged at the moment it is made and again as it runs. What stood there before was one sentence of prose in a tool description, which is the least structural defence available and was being asked to hold against prose written by the person it protects the number from.",

That definition answers TWO questions, and both are DERIVED: which POSITIONS a person reads (the seven), and which FILES — `appFiles()`, the front doors' own import closure. A file is walked because a front door imports it, not because of the folder it happens to sit in. Three failures. MISSING: a sentence in the source that is not in the catalogue — English is the key, so an uncatalogued string is translated nowhere and ships in English to a reader who chose German. ORPHAN: a catalogue entry that matches no string in the app — nothing breaks today, which is precisely why it rots into a record of what the app used to say while being paid for on every build. UNREACHABLE: a file under web/, web-portal/ or shared/ that says something a person reads and that the walk never opens — censused off the DISK rather than off the graph, so a resolver that missed an import cannot hide behind its own answer, with a reasoned UNWALKED_OK line the only way out and a rot check so the list can only shrink. The walk stops at ONE directory, `shared/ui/`, the vendored component library: `resolveImport` always refused it, by package name, as 'somebody else's code and not ours to translate', and vendoring changed its address rather than what it is — the app still says its own words through the props it translates. The reason, and the screen-reader residue it leaves as real debt, are in VENDORED_UI_SCOPE. And the same sentence from the other end: the call site and the definition never disagree — every `t(\"…\")` literal must be a string the walk accepts, because a developer wrapping `t(\"of\")` has DECLARED it copy while isUserVisible refuses it as a non-sentence, and the fix is never to widen the predicate but to write the whole sentence with a hole in it, which is also the only shape a translator can reorder.",
    why: "The translation pipeline is BUILD-TIME (13.5): every language the app speaks, produced once per deploy, costing nothing at runtime. That design's whole load-bearing assumption is that the catalogue is current, and its only enforcement was a person remembering to re-run a script — the weakest kind of rule in a codebase whose other twenty-seven are machine-checked. The extractor already had a `--check` mode and it was never wired to anything. Then, on 2026-08-19, the second half of the question: current AGAINST WHAT? The set was six hand-written folders, and three kinds of copy had been living outside them under a green build. `formatRelative` (shared/web/format.ts) returned \"just now\", \"5m ago\", \"3h ago\" and \"2d ago\" in ENGLISH to nine call sites across BOTH front doors, so a German reader read *Erstellt von Aurora · 5d ago* — the translated half and the untranslated half of one line, on every record in the app. The whole language settings screen and the whole text-size section live in shared/web/, already wrapped in `t(...)`, in no catalogue; they only looked finished because the SEED happened to carry by hand the three languages somebody here can actually read. And shared/scale.ts holds \"Compact\", \"Comfortable\" and \"Large\", rendered through `t(step.label)` with the English one directory outside the walk. A folder list cannot be made correct, only current — and \"current\" is exactly what nobody notices going stale. An import cannot be forgotten, which is R24's reasoning applied to words instead of money. The check re-runs the real walker rather than describing it: a check with its own idea of \"a string a person reads\" would be a second definition, and the day the two drifted the build would stay green while the app spoke English.",

Both directions: an unclassified send fails the build, and a census entry matching no send is an orphan and fails too. No email may spell an origin: the two front doors arrive as configuration, because THE RECIPIENT DECIDES WHICH APP THE LINK OPENS — staff read the agency app, a client contact reads the portal, and the same ticket therefore has two addresses.

So the deliverable is the CENSUS — the same shape as R27's vocabulary and R13's exemptions — and the buttons are what it forced.

No other step of the scale may be written in `web/`, `web-portal/` or `shared/`, and `shadow-*` stays at exactly one use. ONE further radius is admitted, as DATA with its reason in `RADIUS_EXCEPTION` and rot-checked so an exception nothing uses turns the build red: `rounded-select` (6px), on the mark of a selection control, because at `rounded-xl` a checkbox is a lozenge and at `rounded-full` it is a radio button. The kwapso kit admits a second (4px on a bar, on the grounds that a bar is not a box), and the kit's gantt, heatmap and flowchart now draw it as `rounded-[var(--radius-bar)]`. The kit vendored at `shared/ui/` SPELLS THE SAME TWO WORDS THROUGH ITS TOKENS: `rounded-pill` is its pill (`--radius-pill`, the themable spelling of `rounded-full` — data in `RADIUS_EXCEPTION` with the rest), and any `rounded-[…]` whose bracket RESOLVES THROUGH A RADIUS TOKEN — `var(--radius…)` plain, on one edge, `inherit`, or a `calc()` over the token for a concentric inner corner — is the same vocabulary spelled where a named step cannot reach. What stays forbidden is exactly what was always forbidden: a NAMED third step (`rounded-lg`, `rounded-md`, `rounded-2xl`…) or a bare number that answers to no token. A third BOX radius is still forbidden. Enforced by one grep, because every step from `sm` to `3xl` already resolves to the same 24px in this theme.

So five words were in use for one value, which means five decisions a developer can make where there is only one, and the day the theme gives those steps different values the app acquires five radii it never chose. The law could not be written before the fix, because a law that ships with a 57-line exemption list is a list and not a law. It ships the moment the grep is clean. THE ONE THING IT DOES NOT REACH is the bare `rounded` class: that is 4px here, not 24px, so it is a genuinely different value on an inline highlight and a 32px thumbnail, and folding it in would be a redesign wearing a sweep's clothes.",

A `label:` or `helpText:` on an object that spreads a field config is translated ON THE WAY TO THE SCREEN by `shared/web/field.tsx`, which is positional (the object says what it is) and is held shut by the second half of the check: NO file in either front door may import `Field` from the library directly, so the seam cannot be walked around. The ban is matched on the PATH TAIL of the kit's Field — `components/field/field` since the kit's v1.1.0 layout move folded `controls/` and `structures/` into one `components/` on 2026-08-27 (it was `controls/field/field` from the design-kit swap until that move, and `primitives/field/field` before the swap, and each rename is exactly why the tail must move WITH the file: a ban matching a path nothing imports is a ban that passes vacuously, which it silently did for one evening until the story pass caught it). The check no longer takes the literal on trust — it asserts `shared/web/field.tsx` actually imports that tail before judging anybody by it, so a fourth rename fails loudly rather than reporting all clear. That guard was added when the second rename landed; this SENTENCE was not, and named the dead `controls/…` tail until 2026-09-06. Everything else is a copy TABLE read through `t` somewhere else, and each one is DATA in `TRANSLATED_WHERE_READ` with the seam that reads it, rot-checked both ways — a pin that no longer has an unwrapped position of that kind turns the build red, and so does a `via` that no longer appears in the source, so the list can only shrink.",

The catalogue was current and the screens were English, because nothing had ever checked that an EXTRACTED position is a WRAPPED one. The field labels are the reason it went unnoticed for so long and the reason the fix is a seam rather than 138 edits: a field config is a module-level constant, `t` is a hook, so `t(...)` genuinely could not be written where those words are declared — the one class of string in this app that a developer could not have wrapped even if they had thought to. `translateRecipe` had already answered the identical question for the screen recipes (declare the English, translate on the way to the screen); this is that answer applied to the other half of the app, plus the import ban that makes it provable.",

Never nothing, and never the glyph written INTO the words (a pictograph inside a sentence is the one shape UI-CONVENTIONS §5 refuses).

WHY THE CHECK IS POSITIONAL RATHER THAN VISUAL: there is no honest regex for 'this JSX is a record row' — `.map(x => <li>` matches attachments, replies, comments and steps, none of which are records.

A create dialog cannot upload while somebody types — R2 is addressed by the record's id and on a create that id does not exist yet — so the picked files wait and are hung on whatever `onSubmit` HANDS BACK. Every dialog that defers an upload that way is a line in `DEFERRED_UPLOAD_FORMS` naming the maker whose id it needs, rot-checked against the dialog still deferring; and every CREATE call site of it, censused off the disk, must actually return that id — either as a concise arrow whose body IS the maker call, or as a named value that is returned. A site passing the record's id is an EDIT and is skipped, read from the same prop the dialog itself switches on. Deliberately NARROW: the fault is a DISCARDED RESULT rather than a missing call, so there is no absent function to census, only a value that goes nowhere — an honest small law that can be checked beats a general one that cannot.",
    why: "Three of the four `<StoryFormDialog>` create sites did `await createStoryFrom(...)` and threw the id away, so `target` was null, the guarded upload never ran, and every file picked in those forms was dropped in silence: story created, success toast, no error, no row, no object, nothing to recover from. `createStoryFrom` had returned the id since the day the upload was written — the callers simply did not pass it on, and a discarded value looks exactly like correct code. It is the worse half of the class R40 names: R40's failures at least leave the bytes in the bucket.

Per translated language, the count of extracted strings with no non-empty entry — the same predicate `coverage()` already uses — is pinned in `TRANSLATION_CEILING`. The check computes the true count fresh, off the same three files, and requires it to equal the pin exactly: an untranslated string added past the ceiling fails the build (a regression), and a ceiling left higher than the true count after a translation lands fails it too (a stale pin hiding the next regression behind the improvement it never recorded).

A hard zero here would turn every ordinary feature PR red the moment it adds one new label, and a red build that fires on unrelated work is a build people learn to route around — which is worse than no law, because the next accidental regression hides behind the routine one. A ceiling that can only fall keeps the debt VISIBLE and BOUNDED without making it un-shippable: adding untranslated copy is still free, but it is no longer free to hide, because the pin has to move in the same diff and a reviewer sees it move.",

TWO CLAUSES BECAUSE ONE WAS MEASURED AND FOUND TOOTHLESS. The first draft asked only whether a module was reachable at all, and the census came back 21 of 22 green — every module already had a list tool, which is exactly why the failure was invisible: a tool answers when you know to call it, and a person asking a vague question reaches the corpus. So the law separates the two and makes the corpus gap a written decision rather than an accident. THE MONEY IS THE CASE THAT SETTLES THE SHAPE: internal rates and the margin are reachable by tool (`list_internal_rates`, `read_margin`, on the R24-fenced doors), and they must NEVER be in the corpus, because the corpus has exactly one gate — `knowledge:read` — and no way to subtract a caller's denied modules.

A `<ToolbarRow search={data.length > 0 && …} actions={canCreate && <AddButton/>} />` passes R48 outright (it has a `search` prop) while still drawing a lone, floating create button the moment the collection is empty — precisely her screenshot: a Time tab with zero rows, no search box, no sort, no filter, just a circular orange \"+\" sitting above \"No time logged against this yet.\" The audit this law's own census forced turned up the identical shape SEVEN more times, each reasoned as if it were the intended design rather than the bug it was: Sprints' Overview/Calendar toolbar fell back to a bare `<ToolbarRow actions={…}>` \"the same gate waves-screen.tsx puts on its own finder\" (a comment describing the bug as a precedent); Waves' own finder did the identical fallback, precedent and all; a wave's own Sprints tab kept a `<ToolbarRow>` alive through `canCreate` alone, picker included, regardless of `sprints.length`; Deliverables, Modules, and every one of Client-org's three lists (departments/roles/tools) gated `search` on the collection's own length and left `actions` gated on nothing but a permission check; Dropdown values fell back to the exact same shape with an Import CSV button riding along; and Tickets' own Triage queue drew its toolbar from a PARENT component that could never see whether the CHILD's queue — fetched two components away — held a single row. The fix could not be a fourteenth per-call-site patch, so it is not one: `empty`/`restingEmpty` are REQUIRED props precisely because an OPTIONAL one is what let every one of these seven happen — a caller who remembers to gate `search` and forgets to gate `actions` the identical way is not a caller who forgot a rule, it is a rule that was never asked of that slot.",

That reasoning is correct for the row rule and wrong here, and nothing in review catches the difference: the collapsing wrapper is a FLEX ITEM, so its grid is sized under an intrinsic (max-content) constraint, and under an intrinsic constraint a `0fr` track is floored at its own base size instead of resolving to zero. Measured in verify/shell-chat the track never moved off 356.25px — the panel went fully transparent and kept every pixel of its width, pushing the card to 851px instead of the 1207.5px it should recover.

Clause (i) is the other half of the same bug: the column was originally unmounted the instant `isAsideOpen` flipped, so the first attempt at an animation had nothing to animate and the fix had to change the mounting, not the CSS. Clause (ii) exists because the fix for (i) CREATES an accessibility regression if taken alone — keeping a panel mounted so it can animate is exactly what leaves a keyboard user tabbing into an invisible column — and the client's own earlier ruling on the shut state (\"closed assistant show nothing. it's literally only the bar\") is not satisfied by a column that merely cannot be seen.",

It is kept OUT of the searchable pile because the pile has one gate and cannot fence per module: a passage in it is readable by everyone who may ask the knowledge base a question, and this is the one number SCOPE says a client must never see under any setting. So the honest sentence is not 'the assistant cannot see the money' — it can — but 'only the people who could already see it can get it out of the assistant'.

/** R44 — the ceiling. Per translated language, the number of extracted strings
 * (`shared/i18n-strings.json`) with no non-empty entry in `overlay(CATALOGUE,
 * SEED)` — the exact predicate `coverage()` already uses to tell a person
 * choosing a language what to expect. Pinned rather than computed inline so a
 * change to it is a reviewed line in a diff: raising it silently is exactly the
 * drift the law exists to catch, so the check requires the true count to equal
 * this number exactly, in both directions. Measured 2026-08-30.
 *
 * RAISED 307 -> 308 the same day, deliberately, and this is what a raise has to
 * look like. Three mobile placeholders were SHORTENED to stop them overflowing a
 * 375px field — and all three of the long originals were translated while none of
 * the short replacements was, so a width fix was quietly buying itself three
 * English sentences on a German screen. R44 caught it; nobody raised the pin to
 * make the build green.
 *
 * Two of the three cost nothing in the end, because the catalogue already had a
 * shorter sentence that says the same thing: "Search…" became "Search" and
 * "Ask the knowledge base…" became "Ask the knowledge base", both existing keys,
 * both translated in all three languages. Borrowing a sentence the app can
 * already say is always cheaper than writing a new one, and it is the same move
 * the error screen made last week.
 *
 * The third, "Ask about this record…", has no translated equivalent at any
 * length, so it is one string of real debt spent on purpose. THAT is the whole
 * point of the ceiling: not that it never moves, but that moving it is a line in
 * a diff with a reason beside it.
 *
 * LOWERED 308 -> 0, 30 Aug 2026 (feat/i18n-fill), including the debt above —
 * "Ask about this record…" now has all three. All 308 were translated in one
 * run through the app's OWN Cloudflare allowance (`@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b`
 * over the `ai/run` REST door, `scripts/i18n-translate-workers-ai.mjs`), never
 * the owner's ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, grounded in `shared/glossary.ts` and written
 * to `shared/i18n-seed.ts` (never `shared/i18n-catalogue.ts`, which says
 * DO-NOT-HAND-EDIT and means it). Every one was checked mechanically —
 * placeholders survive, "kwapso" survives, no invented trailing full stop —
 * and a 20-string sample across both shapes and languages was read by hand.
 * The ceiling can rise again the same way it did before: a reasoned line in
 * this comment, on the day something is deliberately shipped untranslated.
 *
 * RAISED 0 -> 39 (de only), 1 Sep 2026, ship-night debt, not a design call.
 * The night's own new copy (the record-header/toolbar/tab work, the To-do →
 * Input rename, the new Contacts screen) added 39 English strings with no
 * German entry yet. Neither translation door was reachable from this
 * environment tonight: `i18n-translate.mjs` needs the owner's
 * `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (`~/.config/kwapso/keys.env`, blocked from this
 * session by the same credential-file guardrail that blocked the Cloudflare
 * and GitHub-identity steps earlier the same night), and
 * `i18n-translate-workers-ai.mjs` needs `cf-exec`'s Cloudflare token, equally
 * unavailable here. All three languages moved the same 39 — none of them had
 * these strings yet, not just German.
 *
 * RAISED 39 -> 60 (all three), same night, same reason. The toolbar-everywhere
 * sweep and the kit's real empty-collection design (title + explanation +
 * "Add the first"/"Import a list") added 21 more English strings the same
 * two translate scripts still can't reach from this environment.
 *
 * RAISED 60 -> 114 (all three), same night, merging Alaap's own parallel
 * push — the rail's collapsible groups, the relationship map, the source
 * chips, the assistant's compare/panel width work — with this session's own
 * batch, on top of the ship-night debt above. Same two blocked credential
 * paths, still unreachable from this environment; the same 54 new strings
 * moved for all three languages, none of them ahead of the others. Lower all
 * three back to 0 the next time either script runs with real credentials —
 * it is a few minutes of spend, not a decision to leave open.
 *
 * RAISED 114 -> 115 (all three), same night — the assistant's source-chips row
 * gained a visible "Reading from" caption (client, 1 Sep 2026: the row read as
 * unlabelled black pills with no context). One string, same two blocked
 * credential paths.
 *
 * LOWERED 115 -> 114 (all three), same night — the overnight audit removed a
 * dead three-dot profile-menu button ("Account menu"), which had a real,
 * already-translated string. A genuine improvement, not a stale pin.
 *
 * RAISED 114 -> 124 (all three), same night — the Opus-decided per-collection
 * view work: Apps' Tiles/List switch and Waves' List/Timeline switch, each
 * with their own new copy (view labels, empty states, the Gantt period
 * stepper). Ten strings, same two blocked credential paths.
 *
 * RAISED 124 -> 130 (all three), same night — the Opus-decided Tickets
 * Dashboard tab (the tickets-by-client chart, its own honesty caption about
 * internal tickets, and the tab's own label). Six strings, same two blocked
 * credential paths. */
// RAISED 2026-09-02, 130 → 140: the new Theme and Scale picture-card
// sections (shared/web/theme-section.tsx, shared/web/scale-section.tsx)
// extracted 9 new English strings — the three THEMES/SCALES option
// labels/descriptions this app had not drawn a card for before today. None
// has a translation yet in any of the three languages (no environment here
// carries the credential a real translation run needs — the same blocked
// path every prior raise in this file cites: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or a
// Cloudflare Workers-AI token). Real work still owed, not debt hidden.
//
// RAISED AGAIN, SAME DAY, 140 → 141: the filter row's own "Filter" chip
// gained a count ("Filter (3)") once it carries active facets and the row
// is closed — one new interpolated string, same blocked translation path.
//
// RAISED AGAIN, SAME DAY, 141 → 142: ThemeSection's card press gained a
// success toast ("Theme changed.") to match SpineSection and ScaleSection,
// which already confirm their own presses this way.
//
// RAISED AGAIN, SAME DAY, 142 → 143: the filter panel's facets became compact
// fields (client ruling against her own artifact — see
// shared/web/screen-engine/filter-bar.tsx), so each one says what it says while
// nothing is picked: "Any {what}", ONE new interpolated string. Two strings
// left the catalogue in the same change (the expanded facet's own "Search
// {what}…" and "No matches."), and both were already answered in all three
// languages, so losing them moves no count — the net +1 is the new sentence
// alone, on the same blocked translation path every raise above cites.
// RAISED AGAIN, SAME DAY, 143 → 145: the spine is offered during onboarding
// now (client ruling 2026-09-02, "default spine to mango, but everyone can
// change it during the onboarding or anytime at settings"), so
// web/app/onboarding/page.tsx says TWO new sentences — the set card's badge
// ("Picked", 27.14's own word for the card Settings badges "In use") and the
// field's help line ("You can change this later in Settings.", which is the
// ruling's second clause said out loud to the person it is about). The three
// spine option labels and descriptions are NOT new: onboarding draws the same
// `SpineChoice` Settings draws, so it says the same six sentences the
// catalogue already holds rather than a second set of its own. Same blocked
// translation path every raise above cites — no environment here carries the
// credential a real translation run needs. Real work owed, not debt hidden.
// RAISED 2026-09-03, 143 → 144: the assistant became `ScreenShell`'s third
// COLUMN (client, verbatim: "closed asstant show nothing. it's literally only
// the bar"), so the shell's edge handle needs the second half of its accessible
// name — "Close the assistant". ONE new sentence: "Open the assistant" was
// already the launcher's own label and is already in the catalogue, and the
// column's own name is the catalogued "Assistant". The rail's handle needed
// nothing at all, because "Collapse"/"Expand" were its labels before the handle
// moved into the kit. Same blocked translation path every raise above cites —
// no environment here carries the credential a real translation run needs.
// RAISED 2026-09-03, 144 → 149, SAME DAY, DIFFERENT LANE: a concurrent pass on
// the spine (`shared/spine.ts` + `shared/web/spine-section.tsx`, out of scope
// for the toolbar work sharing this session) added five new sentences —
// `npm run lang` is what surfaced the shift, not a string this toolbar change
// wrote. Every one of `de`/`es`/`ca` moves by the same five, which is why all
// three raise together rather than drifting apart. Same blocked translation
// path every raise above cites — no environment here carries the credential a
// real translation run needs, and this pin only records the count, it does
// not excuse leaving the five in English.
// RAISED 2026-09-03, 149 → 153, SAME SESSION, THE TOOLBAR WORK ITSELF (R48):
// Tasks' Calendar tab and the Triage queue each gained a real search box
// where they used to have none (see filter-bar.tsx/tasks-screen.tsx/
// tickets-collection.tsx and R48 in this file) — three new sentences
// ("Search the triage queue…", "No entries in the triage queue match your
// search.", "No tasks match your search.") plus "Search tasks…", which turned
// out never to have been extracted before despite already being said by the
// existing five non-Calendar tabs (`tasksListRecipe`'s own
// `searchPlaceholder`) — reused here rather than invented, and its debt is
// therefore pre-existing, surfaced rather than caused by this change. Same
// blocked translation path every raise above cites.
// FELL 2026-09-03, 153 → 152, ALL THREE: the count moved off the toolbar's
// own label string onto a real `Badge` beside it (client ruling, same day:
// "Mango round background with no border behind the number" — see
// filter-bar.tsx), so "Filter ({count})" is no longer said anywhere and
// dropped as an orphan on the next `npm run lang`. It was untranslated in
// all three languages, so all three fall by exactly one and none drift apart
// from each other.
// Bumped by +2/language on 2026-09-03: the record-activity audit (R33/R28)
// wired the kit's `ActivityFeed` `loading`/`error` registers into
// `ActivityPanel` (web/components/records/activity-panel.tsx) so a still-loading or
// failed feed stops rendering "No activity yet." Two new `t(...)` sentences
// — "Couldn't load activity" and "We couldn't load this record's activity.
// Try again in a moment." — extract with no seed entry yet in any of the
// three languages. Measured in isolation against a clean checkout of this
// commit's parent with only that change applied (155 → 157); this pin
// covers exactly that rise and does not answer for any other in-flight
// change to the true count.
// Bumped by +14/language on 2026-09-03: the R28/R33/R34 sweep on
// account-detail-panels.tsx (ContactsPanel's remove/restore-contact confirm
// and PortalAccessPanel's revoke/restore-login confirm) wrapped a dozen
// previously-bare English string literals in `t(...)`, including the two
// interpolated confirm titles/labels, each rewritten as a whole sentence
// with a named hole (`t("Remove {person} from {account}?", {...})`) rather
// than a translated fragment glued to a raw value. Fourteen distinct new
// catalogue strings result: "Remove contact", "Remove {person}", "Remove
// {person} from {account}?", "Contact removed.", "Contact added back.",
// "Couldn't remove that contact.", "Couldn't add that contact back.", "Add
// {person} back", "They stay in your accounts, with everything they're
// attached to. You're only saying they're no longer a contact here.",
// "Access taken away.", "Access switched back on.", "Couldn't change that
// login.", "They won't be able to sign in any more. Everything they're
// attached to, their records, their history, stays exactly where it is,
// and you can switch it back on later." — plus work-logs-panel.tsx's own
// new sub-fetch error line, "Couldn't load the hours for this record."
// None has a seed entry yet in any of the three languages. Measured on
// this tree with the concurrent +2/language change above already applied
// (154 → 168); this pin covers exactly this change's own rise on top of
// that one and does not answer for any other in-flight change to the true
// count.
// 2026-09-03, 183 → 186 (loading-toolbar pass, web/components/records/paged-find.tsx,
// load-more.tsx, tickets-collection.tsx, meetings-screen.tsx). This pass's
// OWN new sentences: `t("That's the first {n}. Search or filter to find what
// you're after.")` (load-more.tsx, replacing a translated-fragment-plus-raw-
// English glue) and `t("Nothing in Meetings this week.")` (meetings-screen.tsx,
// the This Week tab's own empty sentence, previously the whole collection's).
// The other two the extractor folded in on this run — "Couldn't load the
// triage queue." and "{name} is on triage this week, so the queue is
// theirs." — are ALSO this pass's own (tickets-collection.tsx's missing
// error branch and its raw interpolated on-duty line), so the note directly
// above crediting them to a different, concurrent change was measuring the
// same shared working tree at an earlier instant of this same edit; nothing
// here was invented to explain a rise somebody else caused. Measured fresh
// against the run this pin now pins to: `node scripts/i18n-extract.mjs`
// scored the true count at 186 for all three languages the moment this
// change was made, so this is a snapshot, not a promise about what anyone
// else lands after it — reconcile again before `npm run check` is trusted.
// 2026-09-03, 186 → 189, AGAIN NOT BY THIS CHANGE: a second `i18n-extract`
// run (needed because the working tree kept moving under a live, multi-agent
// session) folded in three more strings this pass did not write — "A
// colleague", "Your team", "Why a step takes longer, {reason}" — from other
// concurrent work. Recorded rather than reverted, for the same reason as the
// note below: a stale pin hides the NEXT regression, whoever's it is.
// 2026-09-03, 168 → 183, AND NOT BY THE CHANGE THAT MOVED THE PIN. The
// recipe-path fix (screen-renderer.tsx / recipe.ts: no mark on a record title,
// icons on recipe tabs, the Activity block's own registers, the confirm's red
// button and busy state) added ZERO new catalogue strings — every sentence it
// says was already in the catalogue, reused word for word from
// web/components/records/activity-panel.tsx and shared/web/use-confirm.tsx so the two
// implementations of each cannot drift. What raised the count is the
// `node scripts/i18n-extract.mjs` run that change is required to make: the
// working tree's catalogue was stale against several other in-flight changes,
// and the extract folded fifteen of THEIR new English sentences in
// ("Check your connection and try again.", "Couldn't load the triage queue.",
// "We couldn't load your tickets.", the six other "We couldn't load…" lines,
// "{name} is on triage this week, so the queue is theirs.", and the three
// fragments rewritten into whole sentences with holes). Measured both ways on
// this tree: the catalogue as it stood before the extract scores exactly 168
// and passes; after it, 183. So this pin records somebody else's rise, honestly
// rather than by reverting a step the change was told to run — it is expected
// to be reconciled against the other concurrent bumps rather than trusted as
// the final number.
export const TRANSLATION_CEILING: Record<string, number> = {
  // RAISED 216 -> 217 in all three on 8 Sep 2026. ONE sentence, and it is the
  // first of a class worth naming here because the next 48 arrive the same way:
  //
  //  · "The system this work is on. Everything below is narrowed by it." — the
  //    New story dialog's explanation of its App row. It was WRITTEN when the
  //    field was built and has never rendered, because the config set `hint:`
  //    and `FieldConfig` has no such key; it has `helpText`. Nothing in the app
  //    or the kit accepts a `hint` prop, and TypeScript never objected because
  //    the config is a named constant rather than an inline literal, so the
  //    excess-property check does not fire.
  //
  // FORTY-EIGHT MORE LIKE IT sit across both front doors — tickets, sprints,
  // rates, reviews, legal details, time — every one an explanation somebody
  // wrote for a person and no person has ever read. They are outside R28, R33
  // and R34 as well, because those walk `label:` and `helpText:` and a dead key
  // says nothing to anybody. This one was converted alone, deliberately, to
  // MEASURE what the class costs: one ceiling point per language each, so the
  // whole set is +48 more unless it is translated in the same change.
  //
  // The owner asked why the row shows "Required" over a value he cannot touch
  // (8 Sep 2026). This sentence is the answer the dialog always meant to give.
  //
  // RAISED 213 -> 216 in all three on 7 Sep 2026, dead-end lane. THREE new
  // English sentences, all three of them the words a dead end needed in order
  // to stop being one — a field the machine surface could already write, put in
  // front of the person who owns the record:
  //
  //  · "Screen recording" and "Open the recording" — one row and its link on
  //    the ticket's Overview. `help.screen_recording_link` has been settable on
  //    `create_help_ticket`/`update_help_ticket` since the door shipped, stored,
  //    selected and typed, and rendered by no screen on either front door: a
  //    person could hand the assistant a Loom link, read "Screen recording: …"
  //    on the confirm panel, press yes, and never see it again.
  //  · "Who reviews it" — the story's own reviewer, resolved at the door
  //    through `memberOrThrow` and shown by nothing. The row appears only when
  //    a story HAS one (zero of 329 on staging do), so it is a sentence a
  //    German reader meets the first time the capability is used rather than on
  //    every story.
  //
  // NOT TRANSLATED HERE, ON PURPOSE, for the same reason as every entry below:
  // `scripts/i18n-translate.mjs` spends the OWNER'S own API key and has
  // rate-limited his personal account before. The next reviewed run takes all
  // three back down together.
  //
  // RAISED 211 -> 213 in all three on 7 Sep 2026, first-run lane, under the
  // owner's ruling that there should be empty states for everything. TWO new
  // English sentences, both the kit's own empty register (27.21) reaching a
  // host-composed tab the engine never drew for:
  //
  //  · "No tasks with a deadline yet." — Tasks' Calendar tab on a team with
  //    nothing dated. Its own sentence because that tab's collection is the
  //    dated tasks, and a team with undated tasks lands there too, so "no
  //    tasks yet" would be false for them.
  //  · "Nothing in Meetings yet." — Meetings' Calendar tab. The SAME words the
  //    meetings recipe has always carried as its `emptyText`, said at a `t(…)`
  //    call site for the first time; a recipe's `emptyText` is translated
  //    where it is read (screens.ts, `t(c.emptyText)`), which the extractor
  //    does not see, so the sentence was never in the catalogue although a
  //    screen has drawn it since 5 Sep. The calendar tab saying it through
  //    `t()` is what put it here — a genuine debt made visible, not a new one.
  //
  // NOT TRANSLATED HERE, ON PURPOSE, for the same reason as every entry below:
  // `scripts/i18n-translate.mjs` spends the OWNER'S own API key and has
  // rate-limited his personal account before. The next reviewed run takes all
  // three back down together.
  //
  // RAISED 196 -> 211 in all three on 5 Sep 2026, first-run lane, and the
  // arithmetic is written down because R44's whole point is that a ceiling
  // cannot move quietly. SIXTEEN new English sentences and TWO retired ones:
  //
  //  · eleven are the empty states a brand-new team actually reads — the two
  //    shared defaults `CollectionEmptyState` now chooses between, and the
  //    per-collection sentences on Members, Invites, Tickets, Contacts and the
  //    knowledge base. They replace ONE sentence that all sixteen recipe
  //    collections shared and that was true of exactly one of them ("Records
  //    land here … or when a client raises a request from the portal", right on
  //    Tickets and false on the other fifteen).
  //  · four are the landing screen's "Start here" block, which names the first
  //    act on a team with nothing in it — the screen previously answered "where
  //    is everything" and never "what do I do".
  //  · one is the onboarding line, which told everybody "your team gets created
  //    right after" under a product where team creation is closed.
  //
  // TWO OF THE SIXTEEN ARE A REAL LOSS, not just an addition: the retired
  // sentences WERE translated in all three languages, so a German reader trades
  // a fluent-but-false sentence for an English-but-true one on those two
  // screens. That is the right trade and it is still a debt, which is why it is
  // recorded here rather than absorbed.
  //
  // NOT TRANSLATED HERE, ON PURPOSE, and for the same reason as the entry
  // below: `scripts/i18n-translate.mjs` spends the OWNER'S own API key and has
  // rate-limited his personal account before, so a translation run is his to
  // authorise and never a lane's to trigger. The next reviewed run takes all
  // three back down together.
  //
  // RAISED 189 -> 196 in all three on 4 Sep 2026, and the reason is recorded
  // because R44's whole point is that a ceiling cannot move quietly. R48's portal
  // search shipped seven new English sentences — the two search fields, their
  // clear buttons, the no-match copy and the match count — and none of the three
  // languages answers them yet.
  //
  // NOT TRANSLATED HERE ON PURPOSE. `scripts/i18n-translate.mjs` spends the
  // OWNER'S own API key and has rate-limited his personal account before, so a
  // translation run is his to authorise and never a lane's to trigger. Accepted,
  // visible, bounded debt is the shape R44 was written for; this is exactly it.
  //
  // It only ever falls. The next reviewed run takes all three back down together.

The client removed that bar outright (\"when I scroll down, the whole compressed title is useless, so remove that\"), so nothing in either front door now asks \"is this element on screen right now\" — every other scroll-dependent surface in the app is plain `position: sticky` (the record and collection tab strips, the shell's breadcrumb bar), which needs no observer at all.

 *
 * THE BAR FOR A LINE HERE IS HIGH, and it is the whole reason this list is
 * usable. A word goes on it only when, in THIS app, it can mean nothing but the

 * reaches for, and the exclusions are as considered as the entries:
 *
 *   • "client" is NOT here, and it is the most tempting one. `Account` is the
 *     RECORD, but "client" is the relationship — "no client login can reach it",
 *     "what clients have asked us for" — and it is the word the agency uses out
 *     loud. Banning it would flag twenty-six good sentences to catch one bad
 *     placeholder.
 *   • "option" is not here either, because the glossary's OWN definition of
 *     Dropdown values is "the options behind your team's dropdowns". A rule that
 *     contradicts the dictionary it enforces is a rule people learn to exempt.
 *   • "permission" (singular) is allowed and "permissions" is not: "you don't
 *     have permission to open that" is plain English about an act, while
 *     "Permissions" as a heading is a second name for Access rights.
 *   • "request" is not here. It means a ticket on five screens and an HTTP call
 *     or a unit of the assistant's allowance on three others, and no word list
 *     can tell those apart. That one needs eyes.
 *
 * Matched WHOLE and case-insensitively, exactly as written — no automatic
 * plural, so both forms are listed when both are wrong. Explicit data beats a

 * HELD TO THE LAW, no exemption: R32 (closed palette). The library named a

Scanning the vendored copy produces UNACTIONABLE red: the hand-edit guard forbids fixing it here, so the only honest response to a hit is a message upstream, which is a review comment wearing a build failure's clothes. This is the position CLAUDE.md already takes on lint for the same directory and the same reason: 'its own repo lints it; linting a vendored copy we may not edit would only produce unactionable red.'

They are component DEFAULTS: the app says its own words through the props it already translates (`emptyText`, `placeholder`, `label`, `empty`), and R28's subject is what the two front doors SAY. Vendoring must not silently reverse that, because the reversal is expensive in the one direction nobody would notice — the ~150 library strings would enter the catalogue in English, and the only thing that turns an English key into German is `scripts/i18n-translate.mjs`, which spends the owner's Anthropic key. So the walk stops at this directory by PATH now that it can no longer stop by package name.

And the composition's whole premise is IRREVERSIBLE deletion escalating to a typed-word gate for high-stakes cases; this app's own law is deactivate-never-delete (every one of its confirm dialogts, all hand-built on the kit's plain `AlertDialog`, guards a reversible action with a Reactivate path). `ArchiveConfirmationDialog`, the file's other export, was already confirmed a mismatch for its mandatory reason field and its 'Archived tab' concept this app doesn't have.",
  "overlays/export.tsx":
    "MISMATCH, re-checked by rendering: `columns` is not optional and the whole premise (scope choice + column picker + format choice) has no reduced mode — `ExportScreen` with no `formats`/`columns` still draws the scope radio. This app's actual export is a one-click `<a href>` honouring the current filter querystring server-side, a deliberately simpler shape.",
  "overlays/filter-builder.tsx":
    "MISMATCH, re-checked by rendering: `operators={[]}` still renders two comboboxes per row, same as a real operators list — the AND-chained, add/remove-row interaction model has no escape hatch, and this app's facets are single-valued, closed-vocabulary chips (`shared/web/screen-engine/filter-bar.tsx`) with no analog to a condition row at all.",
  "overlays/import-proposal.tsx":
    "MISMATCH, same root as `overlays/import.tsx` — this app's import is agentic, multi-file, multi-table with dependency ordering and FK resolution (AGENTIC-IMPORT.md); there is no manual per-column mapping UI anywhere to plug a proposal review step into.",
  "overlays/import.tsx":
    "MISMATCH. The five-step wizard (`IMPORT_STEPS`: upload → map → check → run → report) is the composition's entire premise, not a configurable subset — no prop skips the manual per-column mapping step this app's agentic import has no place for. The RUN/REPORT steps' visual shape (a live progress rail, a per-row failure list) is a real reusable primitive worth lifting standalone for this app's own commit step, but that is separate, unscoped work.",
  "overlays/quick-view.tsx":
    "GAP, permanent by current design. The app's real row activation (`shared/web/screen-engine/screen-renderer.tsx:683`) is Enter/Space → navigate straight to the full record, with no peek-without-navigating pattern anywhere. Adopting this means introducing a second, competing way to open a record — a navigation-model change, not a missing screen. Will not need this unless that model itself changes.",
  "screens/brand.tsx":
    "GAP, a real finding. Nobody has built a staff-facing page listing the app's own design tokens (colours, type, marks) for reference — the Brand library (`web/app/brand/`) is a client-asset collection of logos and swatches, a different concept entirely, already correctly adopted via the kit's `gallery`. Worth building only if staff actually ask 'what's our poppy hex' more than never; not urgent enough to justify scope on its own.",
  "screens/company-hub.tsx":
    "MISMATCH. `web/components/accounts/account-detail.tsx` already covers this job with a genuinely different anatomy: tabs (Overview/Contacts/work/Rates/Knowledge/Activity), the companies-vs-people split, portal-access rules, `MarginPanel` — none of which the composition's single-page header-figures-lists shape has a slot for.",
  "screens/home.tsx":
    "MISMATCH. The kit's home embeds one live ticket queue inline (`CollectionScreen`, per its own doc, \"a dashboard that cannot be opened into its records is a poster\"); this app's real `/home` (`web/components/screens/home-screen.tsx`) deliberately shows summary figures plus permission-gated link-out cards to six different collections — a different product decision about what a dashboard is for, not a missing prop.",
  "screens/invite-acceptance.tsx":
    "MISMATCH. The composition assumes an unauthenticated person clicking one emailed link, shown one invite, handed to onboarding with no account yet. This app's real flow (`web/components/team/invitations.tsx`) is the opposite on purpose: sign in first however you like, then see an INBOX of every pending invite for that address — a stated fix for 'I was invited but have no way to see it', not a rendering of the same screen.",
  "screens/link-sent.tsx":
    "MISMATCH. Built entirely around a magic link opened on a possibly different device, with a resend countdown and no code. This app's sign-in (`shared/web/use-email-sign-in.ts`) sends a 6-digit code typed on the same device in the same form — there is no separate device, no link, and no waiting-room screen at all.",
  "screens/not-found.tsx":
    "MISMATCH. `NotFoundScreen` is built for one record missing inside an otherwise-fine collection (its own header states this three times) — a record number chip, a real collection eyebrow/count and the collection's own header actions all stay drawn. This app's `<NotFound />` fires when a URL segment names no module at all, so there is no collection context to put in those slots. `screens/page-failure.tsx` is the composition that matches a real case here instead.",
  "screens/onboarding.tsx":
    "MISMATCH. The kit's 3-step tour (who you are / how it should look / what you work on) has no analog: this app's real onboarding (`web/app/onboarding/page.tsx`) is a deliberately single-step form wired to closed-team-creation business logic (`TEAM_CREATION_CLOSED`, agency-vs-client bootstrap branching) the composition has no concept of. STILL A MISMATCH after 2026-09-02, when the client's spine ruling put an appearance choice on that screen: what the composition's step 2 offers is now offered, but as one field in the single form rather than as a step — its `AppearanceOptionGroup`/`SpinePicture` cards are the SUB-PRIMITIVES this app already reaches (`shared/web/spine-section.tsx`), and it is the STEPPER around them, plus a third step for work this app assigns rather than asks about, that stays unadopted.",
  "screens/portal-boot.tsx":
    "MISMATCH. Its 'booting' register is the same static `SignInSplash` this app rejected for `screens/splash.tsx` (see that entry); its 'boot failed' register is the same real condition `screens/page-failure.tsx` already covers, already adopted on the more specific textual match for a whole-page failure.",
  "screens/portal-home.tsx":
    "REALIZED DIFFERENTLY — inherits `templates/portal-home.tsx`'s finding. This file is the route wrapper around that exact template; `web-portal/components/home-screen.tsx` already implements the identical 'savings figure + waiting/delivered' spec natively, so importing either would duplicate rather than add.",
  "screens/portal-impact.tsx":
    "MISMATCH. The kit's `/impact` is a flat progress-bars-plus-savings-figure report; this app's real `/impact` (`web-portal/components/impact-screen.tsx`) is an interactive App → Process → Step drill-down accordion with per-step regression flags, comments and conditional pricing — structure the composition has no slot for.",
  "screens/profile.tsx":
    "MISMATCH. This app's real profile screen (`web/components/screens/profile-screen.tsx`) shows a summary plus an `ActivityFeed` and edits through a separate popup dialog; the composition is an inline full-page required/optional form with its own commit bar — a different editing model, not a missing prop.",
  "screens/session-expired.tsx":
    "GAP, a real unscoped finding — not a permanent exemption. Nothing today persists a signed-out user's identity or a return destination: a 401 clears the session cache and redirects to a bare `/login` with no context (`web/lib/use-active-team.ts`), and there is no redirect-back mechanism anywhere in the login flow to restore to. Worth a scoped brief (identity storage + a redirect-back contract the whole login flow honours) when auth UX gets dedicated attention — real, unstarted plumbing on the one path where a half-built screen locks somebody out of their own account.",
  "screens/sign-in-portal.tsx":
    "OWNER'S CALL. Everything but one line fits cleanly (the two-step email/code flow, resend countdown, 'Wrong address?' back). The one line: `PortalLoginRoute` states a client portal never shows a social sign-in row, and this app's portal shows Google on purpose per SCOPE ch.06 ('signing in with Google never creates access; the invite does'). RECOMMENDATION: keep the app's Google row — SCOPE ch.06's reasoning is a real, already-shipped security stance, not an oversight, and the kit's law reads as a generic default rather than a considered exception for an invite-gated portal; if this still bothers the owner, the in-rule fix is a documented exception upstream in the kit's own law (the shape RADIUS_EXCEPTION already uses), not silently dropping a working feature.",
  "screens/sign-in.tsx":
    "MISMATCH. `SignInScreen`'s own doc header states its shape as T3A-3: one field, magic link, no code — the same assumption `screens/link-sent.tsx` already fails on, and the opposite of what this app's entire sign-in depends on. Its sibling export `AuthShell` has exactly three consumers in the kit (`link-sent.tsx`, `invite-acceptance.tsx`, `session-expired.tsx`), all three already recorded as a mismatch or an unbuilt gap above, so it has no live route to stand under regardless of its own merits.",
  "screens/splash.tsx":
    "MISMATCH. Both its registers point at `SignInSplash`, a static mark with 'NO ANIMATION... it hands over; it does not fade'. This app's real boot screen (`shared/web/mark-loader.tsx`) is a continuously looping, pre-hydration SVG animation plus a dated, owner-motivated hold-until-complete fix — adopting the static mark would be a visible regression against two documented, deliberate decisions, not a lateral swap.",
  "states/archive.tsx":
    "REALIZED, in substance — not a direct import. Of the composition's three separable laws (a consequence-stating band, quiet-ink archived rows, a Status/Updated → Archived-by/Archived column swap), the first is now a real `band` prop on the shared `CollectionFrame` engine seam, live and shipped on Tickets' Archived tab. The other two need each collection's own column definitions to know it is rendering the archived view — real, deliberately per-collection, unscoped work for the other 19 collections that carry an archive tab, not a batch item.",
  "states/empty-collection.tsx":
    "REALIZED, in substance — not a direct import. The composition's own `emptyBody` register (Headline + Text + up to two Buttons, no dashed placeholder) is a real seam now, `CollectionEmptyState` in `shared/web/screen-engine/collection-frame.tsx`, drawn by BOTH of the engine's genuinely-empty branches (kit-panel and legacy) and reused verbatim by every hand-rolled nested collection this app has (work-panels.tsx and its dozen siblings) — one register, not a fourth reinvention of 'a bare grey line'. 2026-09-01: it used to stop at an icon-only mango with no sentence and no second action, which is the client's own 'very wrong' screenshot; it now carries composition 27.21's exact two-button register — 'Add the first' (the one carved-out labelled mango) beside 'Import a list', the second only where a call site actually has a real import target for that record type. The rest of the composition (a figure strip of zero-reading stats, per-tab zero-badges) is still not adopted: `CollectionConfig` has no 'figures' or per-tab zero-badge concept, and inventing either is separate, unscoped scope.",
  "states/new-empty-record.tsx":
    "MISMATCH. There is no standalone screen to replace: every record-detail file (`role-detail.tsx`, `sprint-detail.tsx`, `story-detail.tsx`, and others) hand-rolls its own empty-copy into its own `CollectionFrame`/`ShapeStateBody` call. A real equivalent exists, just scattered across as many files as there are record types — not a gap, a different shape.",
  "states/no-results.tsx":
    "MISMATCH, a real but non-urgent one. The composition's register states the exact total count, the single narrowest-excluding facet, and a live would-show-if-cleared number for that one facet — genuinely richer than this app's plain sentence, but the middle claim requires the engine to answer a question it has never had to (re-running row selection per candidate facet, with real unresolved edge cases: ties, a facet excluding every row alone, a search term interacting with a facet). This app's existing 'Clear filters' button already works, so the plain sentence is not a dead end — plain-and-correct beats rich-and-speculative until a dedicated pass builds and tests the computation against real filtered data.",
  "templates/collection-screen.tsx":
    "REALIZED DIFFERENTLY — this file literally renders `MainScreen` internally, so it shares `templates/main-screen.tsx`'s finding: `ScreenShell` wrapping `CollectionFrame` in the exact `tone=\"bare\" inset={false}` shape this app's own engine already reached independently. The one open question the pair raises (a genuinely per-screen header vs. this app's in-body `CollectionHeading`) was decided not pursued — see `templates/main-screen.tsx`.",
  "templates/form-screen.tsx":
    "MISMATCH, on a sharper reason than the layout question. `surface=\"page\"` is confirmed (by render probe) to be a bare div, so the earlier dialog-vs-sheet objection is resolved — the remaining, real blocker is that the composition's actual value over `FormShell` is a required-fields-by-name summary sentence, a 'fields need attention' card and a changed-fields-by-name dirty band, none of which any of `FormShell`'s 32+ callers track today (every one disables Submit on an aggregate boolean, never a list of field names). Lighting that up is a real, scoped feature — instrumenting every field in every form with a name and an empty/dirty state — not a chrome swap behind one flag the way the already-adopted engine states were, because the state those adoptions needed already existed and this one does not.",
  "templates/import-flow.tsx":

    "REALIZED DIFFERENTLY. Structure: `ScreenShell` wrapping `CollectionFrame` with `tone=\"bare\" inset={false}` — the exact shape this app's own engine (`shared/web/screen-engine/collection-frame.tsx`) already reached independently, confirmed correct by reading the kit's reference afterward. The one gap (`MainScreen`'s per-screen header vs. this app's `CollectionHeading` rendered in-body) was raised and explicitly decided not pursued: recomposing it is invisible to any adoption count either way, and widening `AppShell`'s generic header channel for a gain nobody could point at, mid-launch, was the wrong trade.",
  "templates/multi-step-form.tsx":
    "GAP, permanent. No wizard-style form exists anywhere in the app — every one of `FormShell`'s 32+ forms is single-step by design (one Dialog, one Submit). Confirmed independently by the kit's own component, which warns at runtime when no step depends on an earlier one — exactly this app's shape. Will not need this unless a future feature genuinely requires sequential, dependent steps.",
  "templates/portal-home.tsx":
    "REALIZED DIFFERENTLY. `web-portal/components/home-screen.tsx` already implements the identical spec (a savings figure, a waiting/delivered list, the scoped ambient field) natively, with its own components. Nothing here to adopt that isn't already built.",

    "REALIZED DIFFERENTLY. Read in full, this template is nothing but `ScreenShell` (header slot empty) wrapping `RecordChrome` — exactly what this app already assembles from the same, already-adopted parts under different file names: `AppShell` is now `ScreenShell`, and every record screen composes `RecordChrome` through the `RecordScreen` host seam. The one real difference — this app's persistent breadcrumb+timer header on record screens, where the template leaves that band empty — is a deliberate product choice (one header treatment everywhere), not a technical gap.",

This app has no way to search across everything from anywhere — the only search-like control (`record-picker.tsx`) is a per-field relation picker scoped inside one form, not global search. Worth the owner's consideration as a genuinely useful, separately-scoped feature for a multi-module tool; not something to fold into a UI-adoption pass.",
  "templates/stat-strip.tsx":
    "REALIZED DIFFERENTLY. `pulse.tsx`'s `PulseBand` already draws its headline numbers through the kit's own `StatGrid` component directly — the exact primitive this composition is itself built on top of. The one thing this file adds beyond `StatGrid` is the optional per-tile `spark` mini-chart, and using it on these tiles is exactly the fusion `pulse.tsx`'s own law forbids ('aggregate into a big NUMBER or reach for a CHART, never fuse them') — the tiles that want a chart already draw one as a separate `BandCard`, by design.",
