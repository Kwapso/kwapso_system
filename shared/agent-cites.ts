// THE CITATION MARK — one declaration the model's prompt and the app's renderer
// both read, so the assistant can never write a mark the app cannot draw.
//
// The SHAPE of a citation is not decided here and must not be: the design kit
// ruled it (RULING D7-2, shared/ui/components/agent-chat/agent-chat.tsx) and the
// kit draws it — a superscript `<Cite for="…">` where the claim is made, and a
// numbered `collection · record` pill underneath the turn. What is decided here
// is the far smaller question the kit cannot answer: how a MODEL, which writes a
// string, says "the mark goes here".
//
//     Three of the four overdue invoices are on the Ostwald retainer[[src:01J…]].
//
// WHY THIS SPELLING.
//   · It survives `escapeText`. The reply is untrusted, so it is escaped before
//     anything else happens to it; a mark built from < or & would come out the
//     other side as an entity and the renderer would never find it.
//   · It is not markdown. `[[` is not a link, an emphasis or a fence, so a model
//     that has never heard of this — or a transcript replayed into a plain-text
//     client — degrades to a visible, honest breadcrumb rather than to markup.
//   · It names the SOURCE, never a number. The kit's ruling is explicit that the
//     number is the source's position in the turn's own list and is derived, so a
//     model that numbered by hand and then re-ordered would be the one thing the
//     ruling exists to prevent.
//
// AND A MARK THE TURN CANNOT BACK IS DRAWN AS NOTHING. `Cite` renders null when
// its `for` names no source under that turn, so a model reaching back to an
// earlier question's passages produces no superscript at all. That is the
// boundary being cleaned rather than the instruction being trusted: on 26 Aug
// 2026 the compose path measured 10 answers in 16 appending a source list the
// prompt had told it not to write, so "the model was asked nicely" is not a
// defence this base accepts any more.
//
// A KNOWN LIMIT, WRITTEN DOWN RATHER THAN FIXED (31 Aug 2026). R23 makes
// retrieval hand back real passages and real sources — it does not, and cannot,
// stop the model writing something ungrounded in the PROSE BETWEEN two marked
// claims. Measured on staging: asked to summarise a meeting, the reply carried
// six real citations, correctly marked, AND a specific enumeration ("the four
// payment branches: flu-private, flu-com...") that appears in NO indexed
// source at all — the real passage says only "the four payment branches",
// unnamed. `splitCites` faithfully renders whatever the model wrote; it has no
// way to know a run of unmarked text is invented rather than a fair paraphrase
// of the passage either side of it, because the two look identical on the wire.
// The mark proves a claim HAS a source; it says nothing about the sentence
// standing next to it that has none. Closing this gap — verifying an unmarked
// span against the passages it sits beside, or requiring a mark on any specific
// enumerated detail — is a real project, not a line here.
