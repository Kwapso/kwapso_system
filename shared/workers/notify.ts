// How a worker that ISN'T auth sends an email. Only auth holds the Resend key, so
// everyone else hands the finished message to auth's internal send door. This was
// copied into tenancy and content byte-for-byte, and inlined a third time in the
// invite path — three places to fix a header, a URL or a failure log.
//
// Best-effort by design: a notification must NEVER fail the action that triggered
// it (the role already changed, the reply already saved). So this swallows its own
// errors and RETURNS whether the door accepted the message — the invite path needs
// that answer, because it tells the user honestly whether the email went out.
