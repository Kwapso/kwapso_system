/** HOW MANY OBJECTS ONE TEAM'S CHANNEL IS SPREAD ACROSS.
 *
 * A Durable Object is single-threaded and a broadcast is a serial loop over its
 * sockets, so ONE object per team made the team's socket count the ceiling: at a
 * few thousand listeners a ping costs hundreds of milliseconds of one object's
 * only thread, and every later publish queues behind it. Cloudflare's soft
 * ceiling for one instance is ~1,000 requests/second and each publish is one
 * request, so the publish rate reached it before the loop did.
 *
 * Splitting the channel divides the sockets — and therefore the per-ping work AND
 * the per-object request rate — by this number. It is the one change that moves
 * the ceiling rather than shaving the constant in front of it.
 *
 * THE COST IS PAID BY THE PUBLISHER, and it is paid INSIDE the realtime worker
 * rather than here: a publisher still makes ONE call naming `team:<id>`, and
 * realtime fans that out to the shards. Every one of the hundred-odd
 * `publishChange` call sites is therefore untouched, which is the whole reason the
 * split is shaped this way — a fan-out written at the publisher would have been a
 * hundred chances to write it differently.
 *
 * WHY FOUR. Each shard is a real object with real per-request overhead, so this
 * trades publish work for broadcast headroom and the trade only pays while the
 * broadcast is the expensive side. Four takes the ceiling from ~3–5k concurrent
 * listeners per team to ~12–20k, which clears the yardstick's 25,000 peak only
 * once combined with subscription scoping below — and it keeps a quiet team's
 * publish cost to four hibernating objects instead of one, which is nearly free
 * (an idle object is evicted). Raising it is a one-line change; the number is here
 * rather than inline so the client and the fan-out can never disagree about it. */

/** HOW MANY SOCKETS ONE SHARD MAY HOLD BEFORE SOMEBODY IS TOLD.
 *
 * The paragraph above states a ceiling — four shards take a team from ~3–5k
 * concurrent listeners to ~12–20k — and then says the yardstick's 25,000 is
 * cleared "only once combined with subscription scoping". Both halves were
 * comments. Nothing measured a real team's listener count, nothing measured what
 * scoping actually removes from a broadcast, and nothing would have said a word
 * as a team approached the number: the first symptom of crossing it is every
 * publish on that team queueing behind a serial loop, which reads as "the app
 * feels slow" and points at nothing.
 *
 * 3,000 is the LOW end of one object's own range, deliberately — the point of a
 * watch is to fire while there is still time to raise `REALTIME_SHARDS`, and
 * raising it re-shards every listener (`shardFor` is a modulo of the count), so
 * it wants a maintenance window rather than an emergency.
 *
 * The row it writes carries the two numbers nobody has: how many sockets that
 * shard is holding, and how many of them the ping was actually sent to. The
 * second is the measurement of subscription scoping — the thing the ceiling
 * arithmetic depends on and that has never been observed on a real tenant. */

 * gain nothing (the shards are identical and the account fence rides the socket,
 * not the shard). It must be IDENTICAL on the client and in the worker, which is
 * why it lives in the seam both import rather than being written twice. */

/** WHY A REGISTRY, AND THE HONEST ARITHMETIC.
 *
 * A publish fans out to every shard whether or not anybody there is listening
 * for that resource. The registry lets the door ask once and skip the shards
 * with nobody interested.
 *
 * At REALTIME_SHARDS = 4 this is roughly a wash and can cost one extra call:
 * 1 registry read + K interested shards, against 4 unconditional shard calls.
 * It wins at K ≤ 2 and loses at K = 4. That is not the reason it exists.
 *
 * IT EXISTS TO REMOVE THE CEILING ON THE SHARD COUNT ITSELF. Sharding divides
 * broadcast work by N but multiplies publish work by N, so ARCHITECTURE.md §7's
 * own table shows 128 shards failing on the publish side at ~22,000 object calls
 * a second — the fan-out becomes the bottleneck exactly when the sharding starts
 * to matter. With interest routing the publish side stops scaling with N and
 * starts scaling with how many shards actually care, which is what makes a
 * larger N worth having. Raising REALTIME_SHARDS is the follow-on decision this
 * unlocks; it is deliberately NOT taken here, because that number is a locked
 * one and this change is the prerequisite, not the change itself.
 *
 * FAIL OPEN, ALWAYS. Every unknown answers "interested": an unregistered shard,
 * an entry older than a listener's own deadline, an unreachable registry, a
 * malformed reply. The cost of a wrong "yes" is one wasted object call. The cost
 * of a wrong "no" is a screen that goes quietly out of date, which is the single

  //
  // WHAT IT SAID, and why it was right at the time: this hop is best-effort, so
  // a live layer that is down costs a screen its instant refresh and nothing
  // else — but a HUNG realtime is worse than a dead one, because without a
  // ceiling the publish keeps the mutation's request open and an unwell live
  // layer turns every successful write into a slow one. The two-second ceiling
  // below is that argument's answer and it STAYS.
  //
  // WHAT CHANGED: the owner was asked "say 'saved' straight away, and finish the
  // history entry a moment later?" and answered yes. So the ping no longer holds
  // the response at all — it runs on the request's own lifetime through
  // `ctx.waitUntil` (parallel.ts), which GUARANTEES completion. This is deferral,
  // never fire-and-forget: the ping still goes, the failure is still recorded by
  // `note` below, and the fetch still LEAVES at the same instant it left before.

  // relayed rather than typed into it, and has since been confirmed first-hand —
  // his own one-word reply against the numbered item. parallel.ts carries the
  // full provenance note; the chain is kept rather than collapsed.)
  //

  // for a moment the person who saved sees it done before a colleague's screen
  // moves. That moment is the DO hop, and its ceiling is the `AbortSignal` two
  // lines down — two seconds, the same ceiling that already bounded how long the
  // clicker could be made to wait. It cannot be longer than that, because the
  // request is aborted at exactly the point it used to give up.
