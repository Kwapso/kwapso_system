// THE GUARD CORRIDOR — session → person → the ONE account they are standing in
// (SCOPE ch.06, "Access and the fence"). Every account-scoped query is built
// from THIS stamp; none is ever built from a request parameter. A door that
// reads `?accountId=` and trusts it is the whole leak, so the shape here is
// deliberate: you cannot get a WHERE clause out of this file without first
// having resolved a caller.
//
// Two caller kinds, and only two:
//   • STAFF   — a team member with no portal row: the agency side, fenced by the
//               permission matrix alone (they are meant to see every account).
//   • PORTAL  — a client-side person: pinned to ONE account's world at a time,
//               no matter which door they knock on, no matter what their role
//               says.
//
// ONE AT A TIME, deliberately (owner decision, 10 Aug 2026). A person who acts
// for two of your clients belongs to both, but sees one at a time and switches
// between them — the same bargain the team switcher makes: you own the data,
// it simply isn't fetched while you're standing somewhere else. Mixing two
// clients' work into one screen is confusing at best and a disclosure at worst.
//
// WHICH WORLD IS THEIRS. A person reaches a company two ways, and both are the
// same sentence: "you belong to this company". Either their own row hangs UNDER
// it (`parent_account_id` — the contacts a company's record carries), or they
// are LINKED to it (the many-to-many, which is the only way one person belongs
// to two). From the company they are standing in, the fence then reaches DOWN
// through everything nested beneath — a holding company's stakeholder sees its
// businesses. It never climbs past the company itself: a person at a subsidiary
// does not inherit the parent group.
//
// FAIL CLOSED, and note WHICH way: portal-ness is decided by the PRESENCE of a
// portal_users row, never by its absence. A revoked row still makes you portal —
// standing nowhere, seeing nothing — rather than silently promoting you to staff
// the moment access is withdrawn. "Deactivate, never delete" is what makes that
// safe: the row that proves you are a client outlives your login.

 * `FENCE_INPUTS` says what the fence READS to work out where a caller stands.
 * `FENCED_ROW_OWNERS` says which column decides whose side of the fence a row
 * sits on. Neither can see THIS one, because the fence never reads it at all:
 * `accounts.email` is what `userIdForPerson` (workers/tenancy/src/routes/accounts.ts)
 * resolves a portal grant's PERSON from — account row → its email → the `users`
 * row with that email → the `user_id` the `portal_users` row is written for.
 *
 * So the sentence the three make together is: FENCE_INPUTS decides WHERE you
 * stand, FENCED_ROW_OWNERS decides WHICH ROWS stand with you, and this decides
 * WHO YOU ARE. Re-point the email and the next grant — approved in good faith,
 * on an account whose name never changed — hands the login to somebody else.
 * Anyone can put a `users` row behind an address of their choosing: signing in
 * once at the open front door is the whole of it.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT JUST A LINE IN FENCE_INPUTS. That list is machine-checked to
 * mean exactly "columns the corridor reads" — `fence-confirm.test.ts` walks the
 * SQL and fails on a declared column the fence no longer reads. `email` is not
 * one and never will be, so filing it there would have bought a confirm panel by
 * making a true list untrue, and the next reader would have deleted it as stale.
 *
 * WHO READS THIS. `shared/workers/tool-gates.ts`, beside the other two.

 * a person this way, so the day it stops, the line goes red instead of quietly

 * column on each table that says which account owns the row, and therefore which

 * (`ticketFence` → `accountScopeClause(scope, "account_id")`).
 *
 * Both change who can see whose; they just change it from opposite ends. Writing
 * `accounts.parent_account_id` MOVES THE FENCE. Writing `help.account_id` MOVES

 * naming a client on an agency ticket publishes that conversation into their
 * portal in one call.

 * WHO READS THIS. `shared/workers/tool-gates.ts`, beside FENCE_INPUTS, to
 * decide which machine-surface writes must stop for a confirm panel. It is
 * declared HERE rather than there for the same reason FENCE_INPUTS is: the list
 * has to sit next to the clause it describes, or the next module to grow a
 * fenced column will be added to the fence and forgotten by the panel — which is

/** THE FENCE, RESOLVED ONCE PER REQUEST.
 *
 * `accountScope` is a pure function of the caller, and one screen open asks for
 * it seven times — every door calls it, and `refusePortalCaller` calls it again
 * inside doors that also call it directly (`record-counts.ts` did exactly that:
 * two identical `portal_users` reads, back to back, on the one door that runs on
 * every record open). Each of those is a fresh HTTPS request to the D1 REST API,
 * so the repeat is not free the way a repeated function call normally is.
 *
 * WHY A WeakMap KEYED ON THE GUARD IS SAFE, AND A MAP KEYED ON THE USER IS NOT.
 * A Worker isolate serves many requests from many tenants, so anything keyed on
 * a STRING (`userId`, `teamId`) is a cache that outlives the request and can
 * hand one caller another caller's fence — a tenant-isolation bug, not a
 * performance win. `requireMember` (shared/workers/gating.ts) builds and returns
 * a fresh object literal for every request, so the guard's identity IS the
 * request's identity: two requests can never collide on this key, and the entry
 * becomes collectable the moment the request's guard does.
 *
 * THE PROMISE IS MEMOISED, NOT THE VALUE, so two callers racing inside one
 * request share the one in-flight read rather than starting a second.
 *
 * A REJECTION IS NOT CACHED. A failed read is dropped from the map so the next
 * caller in the same request retries rather than inheriting a thrown error that
 * had nothing to do with them.
 *
 * The freshness boundary is UNCHANGED: it was "once per door", it is now "once

/** The fence, for a feed that stores a TABLE NAME and a ROW ID rather than an

 *
 * This is the hole the first security sweep found, and it is worth naming
 * precisely: the fence had been applied door by door to the ACCOUNT doors, and
 * the activity feed is a different door. It gates on "may you read the accounts
 * module?" — which a client login must hold to use their portal at all — and
 * then reads history by (table, id) with no fence, so one out-of-fence id read
 * back another client's history. Row ids are not secret: the live channel
 * broadcasts them.
 *
 * `related_row_id` points at a different table each time, so the clause resolves
 * each one to the account it hangs off:
 *   • accounts       → the row IS the account
 *   • account_links  → the account the link is on
 *   • portal_users   → the account the login is on
 * Staff get no clause. A portal caller sees their own world's history and
 * NOTHING else — not even the existence of a row outside it. */

 * by construction, so the module right alone lets them through.
 *
 * A 403 that says which door they want, rather than a 404 — they are a person we

 * pays for the guard corridor once instead of twice. Ignoring the return value
