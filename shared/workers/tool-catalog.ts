// THE ONE tool catalog — the single source of truth for the endpoints BOTH machine
// surfaces expose: the in-app AI agent (workers/data-ops) and the external MCP surface
// (workers/mcp). Before this, each declared the same ~two dozen tenancy/content CRUD
// endpoints separately, so a new capability had to be added twice and the two could
// silently drift. Now a capability is declared ONCE here and each surface PROJECTS it:
//   • the agent adds its model-facing bits (write / confirm rule / step summary) — see
//     data-ops/src/lib/tools.ts `toAgentTool`;
//   • the MCP adds only its protocol shape (inputSchema = schema, its own name) — see
//     mcp/src/lib/tools.ts `toMcpTool`.
// Both forward to the SAME gated door (the real doors gate + validate + audit + publish),
// so the wiring here (path · method · binding · schema · buildBody) must match the door.
// Surface-ONLY tools stay in each surface's own file: the agent's run_import_batch (SELF)
// + bulk_* + set_help_status_by_filter (all confirm-gated, no MCP confirm panel) +
// get_role_permissions; the MCP's whoami + the caller's own rights + exports + the
// import-catalogue reads + the agentic-import batch tools + the AI-allowance reads +
// the saved conversations + agent_chat/agent_confirm.
//
// THIS FILE IS THE DECLARATIONS, and only those. Two things that used to sit at
// the bottom of it have their own files now, because they answer different
// questions and are read by different people:
//   • `tool-gates.ts` — which permission each write needs, and which writes are
//     grave enough to stop and ask about (TOOL_GATES, isPrivilegeWrite).
//   • `tool-args.ts` — the JSON-Schema shapes and the one runtime type check.
// The dependency points one way: the catalogue may know about those; neither
// needs the catalogue. `SHARED_TOOLS` stays HERE and stays one array literal —
// scripts/smoke-mcp.mjs reads it off this path to derive the R19 filter check,
// and it is the one reader that cannot follow an import.

/** WHY SOME CONSTRUCTIVE WRITES STILL CONFIRM. The rule is that only DESTRUCTIVE

 *   • WHO CAN DO WHAT — anything gated on member_roles: or team_members:;
 *   • WHO CAN SEE WHOSE — anything that writes an input to the ACCOUNT FENCE
 *     (`FENCE_INPUTS` in account-scope.ts: the parent pointer, account_links,
 *     portal_users). A client login's whole world is resolved from those rows,
 *     so linking a contact or re-parenting an account widens what an outside
 *     company can read — without touching a permission at all.
 * The model reaches all of them while reading team data an attacker can author (a
 * ticket description is up to 20,000 characters of someone else's text). Fenced
 * tool output plus one system-prompt sentence is a soft defence; a confirm panel
 * the admin must click is a hard one. So these confirm — not because they are
 * destructive, but because a silent one is a silent widening of someone's reach.
 * The set is DERIVED, not listed: isPrivilegeWrite() reads each tool's own gate
 * AND matches its door against the fence's own declared inputs, so a write added
 * tomorrow to any of those tables confirms the moment it exists. A name list
 * would have locked the tools above and waved through the next one — which is
 * exactly where update_role was found, and then where link_contact and
 * set_account_parent were found sitting at confirm:false because the derivation
 * only knew about module NAMES and the fence is not a module.
 * The MCP surface ignores `agent.confirm` — it has no panel to show, and the
 * confirming UI belongs to the connecting client. Same door, same gate, same
 * audit row; the asymmetry is documented in MCP.md, not a capability gap. */

    summary:
      "Ask a module a question — the one read tool. `module` names what to ask (describe_module lists them and their fields), and it accepts the other names a thing goes by here, so `help` reaches tickets. Every answer echoes the canonical `module` it used. `where` is a list of filters, each an object of field, op and value, ANDed together; a filter's field may be a LIST of field names, and then any one of them matching satisfies it — which is how a search box works (look in the title, the reference and the description at once); the ops are eq, ne, in, notIn, gt, gte, lt, lte, between, contains, isNull and notNull. Dates work: between takes two values and includes both days, so a whole month is one filter, and a bare date like 2026-07-31 covers that entire day rather than its first instant. in, notIn and between take a list; contains takes one piece of text OR a list, matching any of them. On a field that points at another record (a client, an app), eq and in also accept that record's NAME, and contains matches part of it — so three clients named in a question are ONE filter and need no lookup first. `groupBy` is a list of one or two field names and turns the answer into counts: the reply then carries `groups`, each with its key, a readable label where the field points at a record, and a count — which is how 'how many per client' or 'per month' is one call instead of a page-walk. `countOnly` true answers with the NUMBER and no rows at all — use it for every 'how many' question, because a page of fifty rows you are only going to count is thousands of tokens you have to read to ignore. `fields` narrows what comes back (long text is left out unless you name it). `sort` and `dir` order it, `cursor` walks it. A record is found by its id OR by its human reference, which are two different fields on most modules — a reference handed to the id field finds nothing. If any value you filtered by names nothing here — a client that does not exist, a ticket type this team does not use — the reply carries `unmatched` listing exactly those, and you MUST say so in the same sentence as the number — '97 open across FluClinic and Confia; there is no client called HORSt here'. A total that silently drops one of the things the person asked about is a correct number and a false answer. On a module where records get linked to a client BY HAND rather than automatically (meetings, for now), a query filtering an account by an exact match can carry `unlinked: { count }` — that many more rows mention the client by name but nobody has linked them yet. Exactly as with `unmatched`, you MUST say so in the SAME SENTENCE as the row you are about to name, never present that row alone as the latest — 'The most recent meeting linked to this client is from 6 August; 3 more mention them by name but are not linked to the account yet.' Then a second call filtering by the client's name as text instead, rather than the account, often finds the real one. The reply always carries `records`, an exact `total` over the SAME filters (`totalCapped` true means the count stopped at its ceiling), `hasMore` and an opaque `nextCursor` to pass straight back. Some modules keep put-away rows off their everyday list, exactly as their own screens do — a ticket that has been archived is not on the tickets list — so the reply says `view` when that applies; filter on that field yourself to reach them. A module can bound the OTHER end too: meetings that have not happened yet are off the everyday list, because most future rows are recurring calendar shells with nothing in them and sorted newest-first they answer every 'what was the latest…' question with a placeholder. The reply says `when`: happened means the answer stops at today, and filtering on that same date field yourself lifts the bound and gets you exactly what you asked for. `describe_module` marks the field it applies to.

For one record's own history use scope record with `table` (the table the record lives in — help, stories, accounts, meetings, and so on) and `id`. THE TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT A PERSON ARE DIFFERENT ONES: scope actor with their user id in `id` is what THEY CHANGED, anywhere in the team; scope user with the same id is what happened TO THEM as a member — they joined, their role changed, they were removed. Scope role takes a role id and scope invite takes an invite id. Any scope but team with no `id` answers with nothing rather than with everybody's. `verb` narrows any scope to one kind of event and is one of created, edited, status, archived, restored, deleted, viewed or other — an equality on the row's own stored word, so it finds every archive whatever sentence was written for it.

Pass `id` to fetch just one ticket, archived or not. `sort` puts the page in an order and `dir` ('asc' or 'desc') flips it: 'rank' (the default, the order somebody dragged them into), 'created', 'updated', 'status', 'kind' or 'title'.
