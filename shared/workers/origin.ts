// WHICH FRONT DOOR A CHANGE CAME THROUGH — the one thing an activity row could
// not say.
//
// THE PROBLEM. Four surfaces act as the SAME PERSON through the SAME gated
// doors: the agency app, the client portal, a personal access token on the MCP
// surface, and the in-app assistant acting as its caller. That identity is the
// whole security design and it is right — the agent never exceeds the rights of
// the person it acts for — but it means the trail those four leave is
// byte-identical. "Ana archived Bergman" is the same row whether Ana clicked it,
// whether a script holding Ana's token did, or whether Ana asked the assistant
// to. So after a leaked token the first question anybody asks — WHICH of these
// did this? — has no answer in the one table that exists to answer it.
//
// THE SHAPE. The same shape trace.ts already uses, and for the same reason: THE
// DOOR NAMES THE REQUEST, AND EVERY HOP KEEPS THE NAME.
//
//   • The two public gateways STAMP the surface on what they forward — the
//     agency door writes `app`, the client door writes `portal` — overwriting
//     whatever the caller sent, so a browser cannot label its own request.
//   • The two act-as-user executors stamp their own: `forwardToDoor` takes the
//     origin as a REQUIRED argument, so the MCP surface and the assistant each
//     say which they are on every door they call.
//   • A domain worker re-reads the header in `teamContext` and puts it on the
//     data-door config, exactly where `core` and `stats` already ride — so all
//     139 `logActivity` call sites gained it without one of them changing.
//
// WHY THE HEADER CANNOT BE FORGED INTO A LIE. Only the two gateways are public
// (every other worker sets `workers_dev:false` + `preview_urls:false`), and both
// SET rather than merge. Anything a browser puts here is replaced before the
// request reaches a door. Everything else arrives over a service binding from
// one of our own workers, which sets it too. And this is boundary-validated like
// any other caller string (R20): a value outside the closed set below is not a
// 400 and not a stored string — it reads as `unknown`, because a malformed
// header must never turn a working request into an error, and must never put a
// caller's text in a column.
//
// NOTHING GATES ON THIS. It is a label on history, never an authorisation: no
// permission, fence or refusal anywhere reads it. That is deliberate — the
// moment a surface label decides something, forging it becomes worth trying.
