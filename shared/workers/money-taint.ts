// AN INTERNAL NUMBER CANNOT LEAVE THE ROOM IT WAS READ IN — R24's OUTBOUND HALF.
//
// R24 closed the INBOUND direction and closed it properly: what our own hour
// costs lives in one file, nothing a client login can reach imports it, and the
// build goes red if a portal-reachable path ever does. That sentence is a fact
// about the import graph.
//
// It says nothing at all about the other direction. The assistant reads the
// margin through a door R24 fences correctly — as an agency admin, holding
// `commercials:read`, exactly as designed — and then, in the same breath, writes
// a reply into a ticket thread the client reads. No import was forgotten, no
// condition inverted, no permission granted: every door on that path did its own
// job. The figure still arrived at the client's inbox.
//
// WHAT MADE IT REACHABLE. A client login raises a ticket through the portal
// (`POST /api/content/help` is on the portal's own allow-list, and the seeded
// Client role holds `help:create`) with up to 20,000 characters of their own
// prose in the description. That prose is read by the model the next time
// anybody here asks the assistant a question that touches tickets. So the
// attacker writes the plan and we deliver it: read the margin, then reply with
// it. `reply_help_ticket` is a write gated on `help:read`, the lowest bar in the
// catalogue, and its confirm predicate fires only when the reply @mentions
// somebody — so a reply with no mentions opens no panel at all, and
// `notifyReplyAndMentions` emails the raiser a preview of the body.
//
// THE ONLY THING STANDING THERE TODAY IS A SENTENCE IN A TOOL DESCRIPTION —
// "INTERNAL, never repeat this figure to a client, in any form". R24's own text
// already says why that is not enough, about a different half of the same
// problem: "a condition can be inverted and a permission can be granted, an
// import cannot be forgotten." A prose instruction to a language model is the
// least structural defence available, and it is being asked to hold against
// prose written by the person it is protecting the number from.
//
// SO: IF A CONVERSATION HAS READ AN INTERNAL NUMBER, IT MAY NOT THEN WRITE TO A
// DOOR THE CLIENT'S OWN BROWSER OPENS. Per turn, refused at the step, before the
// door is called. Not a confirm panel — the owner considered and rejected making
// staff click through one on ordinary work — and not a scan of the outgoing text
// either, because "does this paragraph contain a margin" is a judgement and this
// has to be a fact.
//
// ── BOTH SETS ARE DERIVED, AND NEITHER IS A LIST OF TOOL NAMES ───────────────
//
// A hand-written list of money tools would rot the day somebody adds one, which
// is the failure this codebase has now made often enough to have a name for.
// So:
//
//   THE DOORS come from the two files that already decide them, and the CHECK
//   re-derives both off disk and fails if either pin has drifted
//   (`internal-money-never-in-portal`, web/test/rules.test.ts):
//     • the money doors are the tenancy routes whose handlers call an export of
//       workers/tenancy/src/lib/internal-money.ts — the same walk R24's first
//       clause already makes, over the same file, so the two cannot disagree;
//     • the client-readable doors are the non-GET entries of `PORTAL_DOORS` in
//       workers/portal-gateway/src/index.ts — the allow-list is the definition
//       of what a client's browser may call, so it is the oracle rather than
//       anything invented here.
//
//   THE TOOLS are then derived from the doors AT RUNTIME, off the catalogue
//   itself. A money tool added tomorrow on a door already on this list is
//   covered the moment it exists, with nothing edited here. A brand new money
//   DOOR is the only thing that needs a line, and the check demands it.
//
// WHY THE DOOR PINS ARE COPIES AT ALL. The worker cannot read the tenancy lib or
// the portal gateway at runtime — they are other workers' private source, in
// other bundles. So the runtime carries the answer and the build proves it,
// which is the shape `PALETTE_LITERAL_OK` and `STORED_FILES` already use here:
// data, rot-checked against its own oracle, in both directions.
//
// ── WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Named here because a defence whose edges are not written down gets mistaken
// for a wall:
//
//   • ACROSS TURNS. The taint is per-turn, which is the owner's decision and the
//     right one: a thread-wide taint would refuse a ticket reply for the rest of
//     a conversation's life because somebody asked about a margin once, and a
//     control that fires on ordinary work is a control people route around.
//     Tool RESULTS are not replayed across turns (`replayable` in agent.ts keeps
//     user + assistant text only), so the figure does not survive on its own —
//     but a model that said the number out loud in its own prose leaves that
//     prose in the history. Read the honest sentence as: this closes the
//     one-turn chain, which is the shape an injected instruction has to take.
//   • A WRITE ON AN AGENCY-ONLY DOOR WHOSE ROW A CLIENT LATER READS. The oracle
//     is the doors a client's browser opens, not a data-flow analysis of every
//     table a portal GET can reach. Widening it means deriving "which writes land
//     in a table a portal read returns", which is `PORTAL_VISIBLE_READS`'
//     territory and a bigger law than this one.
//     THE TWO THAT MATTER TODAY BOTH STOP AT A PANEL, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS AN
//     EDGE AND NOT A SECOND HOLE — checked, not assumed, on 5 Sep 2026:
//     `resolve_help_ticket` is `confirm: true` outright (it emails the client an
//     answer in the agency's name, and its own comment says there is no
//     un-sending it), and a deliverable is written unconfirmed but reaches
//     nobody until `set_deliverable_visibility` is called with `visible: true`,
//     which confirms on exactly that input. So a person reads the words before
//     the client can. If either of those confirms is ever relaxed, this edge
//     becomes a hole and the oracle has to widen.
//   • WHETHER THE MODEL WOULD HAVE COMPLIED AT ALL. Unproven, and deliberately:
//     nobody has spent an API call to find out. The structural gap was
//     confirmed by reading; the exploitability was not.
//
// ── THE MACHINE SURFACE IS COVERED, BUT NOT BY THIS ──────────────────────────
//
// It was not covered at all when this file was written, and the omission was
// invisible precisely because this section did not mention it: `refusesOutbound
// Money` had two call sites, both in workers/data-ops, and ZERO in workers/mcp —
// while `read_margin` and `reply_help_ticket` were both on the machine surface
// and the injected-ticket chain ran end to end there with nothing in the way.
//
// THE AGENT'S FIX COULD NOT BE PORTED, and that is the part worth keeping. An
// MCP `tools/call` is one HTTP request carrying a bearer token: no turn, no
// conversation, no prior tool list. `moneyIsInContext` over a single call is
// ALWAYS false, so this predicate copied onto that surface would have been a
// check that passed with the hole fully open — a green build over the exact bug
// it was added for.
//
// So MCP refuses a money DOOR outright, at its one forward choke point
// (`forwardTool`, workers/mcp/src/lib/tools.ts), asked of the door the call will
// actually open rather than of the tool's name. Same predicate — `readsInternal
// Money`, from this file — different sentence: not "not in this turn" but "not
// on this surface at all". The precedent is that surface's own twenty-one Google
// tools (MCP.md §3): a leaked personal access token's blast radius must not
// include a mailbox, and it must not include what our own hour costs either. The
// way through is `agent_chat`, which lands back on the agent, where there is a
// turn and this file applies.
//
// A CONSEQUENCE WORTH SAYING OUT LOUD: the two surfaces now defend the same
// sentence with two different mechanisms, so a THIRD machine surface would
// inherit neither by default. Whoever builds one reads this paragraph and picks
// the shape that fits what that surface can actually see.
