// grant-identity, fence-row-confirm, catalog — want this half and not the other.

 * surface, not just the shared ones. The door ENFORCES it; this is the developer hint the
 * MCP `tools/list` description shows external clients ("… Needs member_roles:create."),
 * AND the input `isPrivilegeWrite` derives the agent's confirm rule from. Keyed by
 * canonical name (works for the mcpName ones too). Reads carry no hint (they just need
 * the module's read right).
 *
 * COMPLETENESS IS CHECKED. `isPrivilegeWrite` falls back to a PATH REGEX when a write has
 * no line here — so a future privilege write on a path that regex doesn't match would
 * silently skip the confirm panel, and nothing said the map had to be whole. Now
 * `workers/mcp/test/catalog.test.ts` asserts every write tool resolves HERE or names a
