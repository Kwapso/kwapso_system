// measured, 11 Sep 2026, against a real write: it stores and reads back
// byte-perfect. The real fault is downstream and quieter than a 500 — every
// SQLite TEXT FUNCTION (`substr`, `length`, `LIKE`, …) stops at the first NUL,
// so a stored one silently truncates any read that uses one (a detail screen's
// `substr(body, 1, N)` excerpt, an exact-length check) while the full value
// sits there intact. A screen going blank with no error is worse than the 500
// this comment used to (wrongly) predict. And nothing capped text length, so a
// multi-MB string either bloated a row or 500'd. These helpers type-check,
// strip NULs, cap length, and throw a GuardError the worker already maps to a
// clean 400 — one validation seam.

 * measured as the database will measure them, with 500 KB left over for the rest
 * of the row.
 *

 * just picked, as a `data:` URL on its way to R2, OR the `/media/...` path the
 * row already holds and the form handed straight back. One character cap cannot
 * be right for both, and the one that was there — `TEXT_LIMITS.long`, the PROSE
 * cap — was right for neither. 20,000 characters is about 14 KB of image, and
 * the picker's own output is a 512px JPEG at 30–80 KB, so every real logo came
 * back "Logo is too long (max 20000 characters)" and `storeImageDataUrl`, the
 * seam that exists to turn those bytes into an object, was never reached. The
 * comment at the call site said the byte cap downstream was the one that
 * mattered. It was. It never got a turn: the prose cap sat 166× below it.
 *
 * So the cap follows the SHAPE. A data URL is measured against exactly what the
 * store seam will take — `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`, base64-expanded, DERIVED so the two
 * cannot drift — which leaves the real refusal where it belongs, in bytes, off
 * the encoded text, before anything decodes. Anything else is a path, and a path
 * is a link.
 *
 * One generous cap for both would have been a line shorter and would have put a
 * different hole in: `logo_url` is a COLUMN, read on every row of every list,
 * and a value that is not a data URL passes through the store seam untouched and
 * lands in it. Megabytes of "not a data URL" is the row-bloat-or-500 this whole
 * file was written to stop. */
