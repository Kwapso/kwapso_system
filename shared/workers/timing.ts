// WHAT A DOOR ACTUALLY SPENT — the one thing nobody could see.
//
// THE OWNER'S REPORT, 24 Aug 2026: "the first-time loading of collections and
// details screens is a bit troubling… even today, if I log into the brimba base,
// the speed is not an issue." And a sister app on the SAME base, seeded with
// thousands of rows, is snappy. So "the architecture is slow" was never the
// explanation — something in THIS app's doors is, and nothing in the request
// path could say which.
//
// Measured from outside on the same day, against staging, signed in:
//
//   a 404 (routing only) ....... ~90ms      ← the transport floor
//   /api/auth/me ............... ~280ms     ← + session verification
//   /api/tenancy/my-permissions  ~800ms
//   every real list door ....... 1,400–2,200ms
//
// …while D1 itself reported `sql_duration_ms: 0.95` for the query it ran. A door
// spending a second and a half to do one millisecond of database work is not a
// slow database, and it is not a slow edge. It is COUNT: every `d1Query` is a
// separate HTTPS request to api.cloudflare.com, and the only number that has
// ever mattered is how many of them one door makes, in sequence.
//
// That number was invisible. This makes it visible, and cheap enough to leave on.
//
// WHY IT HANGS OFF THE REQUEST OBJECT. A worker isolate serves many requests at
// once, so a module-level "current request" collector is a race that reports one
// caller's queries under another caller's name. The Request instance is the only
// per-request identity every layer already holds — `teamContext(request, env)`
// receives it and so does the dispatcher — so a WeakMap keyed on it is exact,
// needs no compatibility flag, and collects nothing when nobody asks. Same shape
// as the per-request permission memo in gating.ts, for the same reason.
//
// WHAT IT MAY NOT CARRY. The label is a VERB and a TABLE, derived by regex from
// the statement's own text and nothing else — never the parameters, never an
// inlined literal, never a WHERE clause. This value goes out in a response
// header, and a response header is readable by anything that can read the
// response. A timing seam that leaks a customer's name into a header would be a
// worse defect than the slowness it was built to explain.
