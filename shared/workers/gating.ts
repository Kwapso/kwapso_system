     * for the one class of refusal that carries a diagnosis. When Google answers
     * 401 because somebody revoked the grant, `googleFetch` turns it into a
     * GuardError — so the person reads "Google wouldn't allow that any more",
     * which is the correct sentence, and the STATUS and Google's own reason went
     * to `console.error` and nowhere else, by design. Measured on staging on

     * showed somebody rather than the cause, and on the interactive path the
     * store learned nothing at all. Three weeks later "the Google sync stopped"
     * has no row that says why.
     *
     * So a refusal may now carry the thing the tail had. Setting it does not
     * change one byte of the caller's answer — `fail(status, code, message)` is
     * untouched — it only means the central catch has something worth recording.
