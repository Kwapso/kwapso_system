 * THE WRITE HAS TO HAVE STARTED HERE. The cross-site request forgery check,

 *
 * WHY THE COOKIE ALONE WAS NOT ENOUGH. `SameSite=Lax` is same-SITE, and "site"
 * means the registrable domain — kwapso.app, not agency.kwapso.app. There is a
 * live third-party no-code SaaS parked on portal.kwapso.app (it resolves to
 * Glide's edge), so "any page on our site" is not a set we control. And a form
 * POST needs no JSON content type to reach a door that parses JSON regardless:
 * `<form enctype="text/plain">` shapes its own body, `name=value` becomes
 * `{"userId":"…","roleId":"<admin>","x":"…"}`, no preflight is triggered, the
 * session cookie rides along as a same-site request, `requireRight` passes on
 * the VICTIM's rights, and the member-role door promotes whoever asked. The
 * gates were all working; nobody had asked who started the request.
 *
 * THE RULE, AND WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY. A browser sets `Origin` on EVERY
 * request whose method is not GET or HEAD — form submissions included, that
 * being the whole point of the header. So:
 *
 *   • Origin present → it must be this door's own origin, or the answer is 403.
 *     That is every browser-driven write, and it is the entire attack surface,
 *     because an attacker's page cannot forge the header or suppress it.
 *   • Origin ABSENT → allowed, deliberately. Nothing with a cookie jar omits it;
 *     an absent Origin is a NON-BROWSER caller — the MCP surface answering an
 *     outside tool on a bearer token, `scripts/seed-staging.mjs` building
 *     staging through the front door, the two smoke scripts, curl. None of them
 *     carries an ambient credential a third-party page could ride, which is the
 *     only thing this check exists to stop.
 *
 * The alternative — refuse an absent Origin and teach every script to send a
 * fake one — buys nothing (an attacker cannot get into that branch) and costs
 * the thing that matters: the seed IS how staging is built, so the day it 403s,
 * somebody switches the check off rather than the seed on. A control that makes
 * the ordinary path harder is a control with a short life.
 *
 * `Origin: null` (a sandboxed iframe, a data: URL) is PRESENT and not ours, so
 * it is refused — which is right: that is a browser, with a cookie jar.
 *
 * Deliberately not read: `Referer`. It is stripped by privacy tooling often
 * enough that trusting it means either a fallback that fails open or a door that
 * breaks for careful users. Origin survives that.

 * body was right, and the one header that says WHICH BYTES they are was
 * arithmetic on `undefined`.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG WAS THE QUESTION, not the arithmetic. The old code read R2's
 * answer with `"suffix" in sent ? … : "offset" in sent ? …`, on a stated premise:
 * "it is the shape the real binding hands BACK, so the response can describe what
 * was actually sent." That premise is false. `in` tests whether a KEY EXISTS, not
 * whether it holds anything, and the object R2 returns carries all three keys with
 * `undefined` values — so the suffix branch was taken every single time, for every
 * shape of request, and `size - undefined` is `NaN`. Reproduced exactly, all four
 * request shapes, against a stub built to answer that way; the alternative
 * hypothesis (accessors on a prototype, which `in` also finds) was ruled out
 * because it leaves the suffix case correct and production had it broken too.
 *
 * WHY THE SUITE NEVER SAW IT, which is the part worth keeping. The existing test
 * echoed back the very object `byteRange` had just built — a clean union with only
 * the keys we set — so it measured our own parser round-tripping through a mirror.
 * A stub written from OUR type instead of from the runtime's real answer can only
 * ever confirm us. The tests below now answer the way R2 measurably does.
 *
 * SO WE DESCRIBE WHAT WE ASKED FOR, clamped to the object. R2's answer is used
 * where it genuinely carries numbers — a runtime that DOES report a narrowed
 * slice is still believed — and where it carries nothing, the ask is the honest
 * description, because the body's own length shows R2 served exactly it. Every
 * path returns finite numbers inside the object, or nothing at all. */
