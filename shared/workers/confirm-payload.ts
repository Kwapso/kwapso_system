// WHAT THE CONFIRM PANEL ACTUALLY SAYS — the resolved payload of a proposed
// action, in words a manager can read.
//
// The confirm panel is the DESIGNATED defence against the assistant being talked
// into something. The model reads team data an attacker can author (a ticket
// description is up to 20,000 characters of somebody else's text), so the last
// line of defence is a human clicking "Go ahead". A panel that says only "Set
// access rights for the Sub Admin role" asks that human to approve a payload
// they cannot see — and a confirm you cannot read is not a confirm. So the panel
// shows the BODY THE DOOR WILL RECEIVE: what is approved is what happens.
//
// DERIVED, never a per-tool list. The lines come from the tool's own `buildBody`
// (literally the object posted to the gated door), so a tool added tomorrow
// shows its payload the moment it exists. An unlabelled field still appears,
// under a humanised version of its own key — nothing can hide by being new.
//
// Three things the renderer refuses to do: echo a value whose key smells like a
// credential, run a long value off the panel, or print raw JSON at somebody who
// is not a programmer.

 *
 * WITH ONE EXCEPTION, and it is the whole reason this file exists: a PERMISSION
 * SHEET is never abbreviated. The grid renderer prints one line per module —
 * including every module being set to NO ACCESS — because the door writes them
 * all, and a panel that showed only the grants would let a silent removal
 * through. Collapsing the tail of that grid into "…and 6 more" is the same
 * stealth demotion arriving by a different route: the admin approves a sheet
 * they were shown two thirds of.
 *
 * It was not hypothetical. This cap was 16 while the app had 13 modules, so a
 * sheet plus its role line fitted with two lines to spare — and the day four
 * more modules shipped, the last of them fell off the panel. The fix is not a
 * bigger number, which would rot again at the next module; it is that a grid is
 * not subject to a line budget at all — `hasGrid` below.
 *
 * (Two lanes found this independently and fixed it two ways. The other derived
 * the cap from the module catalogue, which also never rots; it is gone because
 * once a grid is exempt outright the cap governs only payloads that are NOT
 * sheets, and for those a plain 16 says what it means.)
 *
 * AND THEN IT ROTTED ANYWAY, from the other direction, exactly as that comment
 * predicted for the number it had just replaced. Nothing to do with modules this
 * time: an ACCOUNT grew. A company record gained a split postal address, an
 * industry, a paragraph, a logo and a cover, which took `create_account`'s body
 * past sixteen named fields — and the seventeenth to fall off the panel was the
 * language the client is written to. The admin was still asked to approve it.
 *
 * So the number says what it is now: a ceiling on lines a payload can produce
 * VARIABLY (a nested object, an array of ids), sized so that no tool's own
 * declared fields can reach it. A schema is written by hand, one field at a
 * time, by somebody who meant each one; there is no honest reason to hide one
