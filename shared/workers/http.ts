/** R14 — the ONE paged response. A growing collection's door answers through

 * their own key, the server total, hasMore, and the opaque nextCursor the
 * client hands straight back. `extra` carries a door's own additions (help's
 * mineTotal). Drop the seam and the client silently loses page two, so the
 * bounded-lists check asserts every growing door still goes through it.
 *
 * R16 (amended 2026-08-14) — `totalCapped` says whether `total` is the exact
 * number or a floor. It is DERIVED here from the total itself rather than passed
 * in by each door, and that is the whole reason the amendment is safe to make: a
 * door cannot forget to declare it, cannot declare it wrongly, and cannot
 * disagree with the seam that stopped counting. Thirteen call sites needed no
 * edit at all. The same shape as an export's `complete` flag — the fact and the
 * number ride in one object, one decision in one place, exactly as R23 makes
 * `found`/`passages`/`citations` inseparable. */
