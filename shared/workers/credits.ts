// The AI quota gate (owner's credit-based model). Each team gets a FREE daily
// allowance of AI requests; beyond that it spends from a purchasable credit balance;
// out of both, the app hard-stops for the day. A caller consumes ONE
// unit per AI request (the real cost driver) at this single shared gate. Lives over
// the global core DB (agent_usage = the daily-free counter; agent_credits = the
// balance) so it works without opening a team database.
//
// IT IS SHARED BECAUSE THE ALLOWANCE IS. It sat in data-ops while data-ops was the
// only worker that spent a model. Content spends one now — it WRITES the answer the
// knowledge base found (R23) — and tenancy spends one reading a call into a
// proposed process map (process-drafts). One allowance between all three: the
// team's. A second copy of this file would be a second daily counter with the same
// name, and the first person to notice would be the one who ran out twice.
//
// THE CEILING IS A VAR, SO EVERY SPENDER MUST READ THE SAME ONE. `AGENT_FREE_DAILY`
// and `AGENT_NO_DAILY_CAP` are declared in every spender's wrangler config with the
// same values, and credits-invariant.test.ts compares all three — a cap set on one
// worker and not another is one allowance enforced at two different heights,
// which is exactly how tenancy's staging sat at "0" beside the others' "true"
// for weeks before the third name joined the list.
