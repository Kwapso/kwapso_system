  /** TEAM DATABASES THIS DEPLOYMENT CAN REACH DIRECTLY, by database id.
   *
   * The REST door above is a call to Cloudflare's MANAGEMENT API — the interface
   * for creating and listing databases, which we use to run queries because a
   * database made at runtime cannot be named in a config file that shipped
   * before it existed. Measured on staging, 24 Aug 2026: ~400ms per statement,
   * for SQL the database itself reports finishing in 0.95ms.
   *
   * A native binding is the same database over the data plane, in single-digit
   * milliseconds. It has to be named in wrangler config, so it can only ever
   * cover databases that exist at deploy time — which is why this is a MAP with
   * a fall-through rather than a replacement. A team here goes direct; a team
   * created after the last deploy keeps working over REST, exactly as before,
   * until somebody adds its binding. Nothing has to be migrated and nothing
   * breaks if this is empty.
   *
   * WHY THIS CANNOT BE POINTED SOMEWHERE IT SHOULD NOT GO. The key is a database
   * id, and the only database id that reaches this door is `guard.databaseId` —
   * read by `requireMember` out of the `teams` row for the team the caller is a
   * member of, over the core database, on this request. There is no route, body
   * or query string anywhere in the codebase that supplies one. So the native
   * path is reachable exactly where the REST path was reachable, for exactly the
   * same caller, and a wrong or hostile id finds no entry and falls through to a
   * REST call that is itself scoped to that same id. The pipe changed; nothing
   * about who may put something in it did. */

/** THE PAGE'S OWN TAIL, READ OFF THE STATEMENT — the merge's whole input.
 *
 * A concatenation of per-shard answers cannot page or sort, and until 7 Sep 2026
 * this seam said so by REFUSING both. That refusal was correct and it was also
 * the reason the relief valve above it could not be turned on: every collection
 * read in this app is sorted at the door and paged (R14), so a merged read that
 * "worked" would have thrown on the first list request after a move.
 *
 * It is a merge now, and the merge takes its keys from the STATEMENT rather than
 * from a second argument the caller restates. That is the load-bearing decision:
 * a caller-supplied sort key is one more copy of a fact, and a copy that
 * disagrees with the `ORDER BY` beside it produces rows in an order nobody
 * asked for, silently. Parsed off the tail, the two cannot differ.
 *
 * WHY RUNNING THE SAME `LIMIT n` ON EVERY SHARD IS SOUND. Each shard answers its
 * own top n under the same ordering. The global top n is therefore a SUBSET of
 * the union of those answers — a row outside every shard's top n has n rows
 * ahead of it in its own shard alone. So merging the answers and cutting to n
 * gives exactly the rows one database would have given. The cost is n × shards
 * rows in flight, which is the price of the property.
 *
 * WHAT IT STILL REFUSES, and each for a reason that is not laziness:
 *   • an ORDER BY it cannot read as plain columns — an expression, a `CASE`, a
 *     `COLLATE`, a function. The merge would have to evaluate SQLite semantics
 *     in JavaScript to place a row, and a merge that guesses is the wrong answer
 *     wearing the right shape.
 *   • an OFFSET. Skipping m rows per shard skips a different m in the merged
 *     order; there is no local answer to a global skip. Keyset paging (this
 *     app's own, R14) carries a WHERE and no OFFSET, so nothing here needs it.
 *   • the aggregates. One row per shard, and every caller reads the first.
 *     `countCollectionAcross` folds a count properly; the rest have no caller.
 *   • a LIMIT with no ORDER BY across shards — "any n rows" is answerable, but
 *     it is answerable DIFFERENTLY on every call, and a page with no order is a
 *     bug at one database too.
