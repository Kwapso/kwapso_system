// THE QUERY GRAMMAR — what a machine caller may ASK a module, declared once.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The tool catalogue used to answer a question by enumerating
// its combinations: `list_help_tickets` parsed twelve filters, every one of them
// single-valued, none of them a date, and the fifty read tools between them
// differed mostly by which table they named. Measured on 27 Aug 2026, that was
// 192 tool definitions and 31,094 tokens of schema re-sent on EVERY model step,
// and it still could not answer "how many tickets did we resolve in July?" —
// `resolved_at` is on the row and no filter reaches it, so the only route was
// paging 1,820 tickets by hand. One real question cost 369,193 input tokens and
// gave up.
//
// THE OWNER'S RULING (27 Aug 2026): if the permission matrix says a caller may
// read a module, expose HOW TO QUERY it and let the model compose the question.
// Stop enumerating the combinations. So there are two tools instead of fifty —
// `describe_module` says what a module HAS, `query_records` asks it something —
// and this file is the vocabulary they share.
//
// ── NOT RAW SQL, AND THAT IS THE LOAD-BEARING CONSTRAINT ─────────────────────
//
// The model fills in a STRUCTURED request; the engine (workers/tenancy/src/lib/
// query-engine.ts) builds the SQL from it. Nothing a caller sends ever reaches a
// statement as SQL: the table comes from `QUERY_MODULES`, every column comes
// from that module's own declared `fields`, and every VALUE is a bound
// parameter. A model writing free SQL could read `internal_rates` — what our own
// hour costs, which R24 exists to keep off the client's side — and there is no
// undoing a query that has already run.
//
// ── THIS MAP IS AN ALLOW-LIST. NEVER A DENY-LIST ─────────────────────────────
//
// The engine can only ever name a table that appears HERE. There is no list of
// forbidden tables anywhere in the read path, and there must never be one: a
// deny-list is a promise that somebody remembered every case, and the table this
// law is about (`internal_rates`, and `internal_role_rates` beside it) is
// exactly the kind of thing a person adding a module forgets. An allow-list
// fails in the safe direction — a module nobody declared is simply not
// queryable, and the caller is told so by name.
//
// `workers/tenancy/test/query-fence.test.ts` proves it behaviourally, against
// the real schema, as a caller holding EVERY right including `commercials`: the
// internal rate card is seeded, asked for by every handle a caller has, and
// comes back empty every time. Delete the allow-list check and that suite goes
// red — which is the only kind of check worth having.

   * ── WHY A FLAG ON THE FIELD, AND WHAT WAS REJECTED ────────────────────────
   *
   * REJECTED: special-casing the name `ref` inside the engine. It reads as the
   * smallest change and it is wrong twice over. It puts the fact "a reference
   * has a history" in a second place — the engine — where the whole design says
   * a column is a fact of this table; and it is not even TRUE of every `ref`.
   * `tasks` has a `ref` column, a live unique index and 109 old `<account>-K####`
   * strings, and migration 0068 deliberately left every one of them alone
   * (a task mints no reference at all, so there was no kind to carry them to —
   * `REF_TABLES_WITHOUT_A_KIND` in shared/rules/registry.ts is where that
   * decision is written down). A name-based special case would hang an `EXISTS`
   * over a history that cannot exist and quietly claim to search it.
   *
   * REJECTED: a general "this field has a history" notion — a per-field pointer
   * at some table of retired values, with a column pair to join on. It is the
   * shape a second user would want, and there is no second user: a sweep of all
   * sixty-nine team tables finds exactly one that remembers what a value used to
   * be, and it is `ref_aliases`. A generic mechanism with one implementation is
   * not generality, it is an indirection that has to be read twice — and it
   * would take the one thing the seam gives us for free, that `refAliasMatchSql`
   * is the ONE spelling of this join anywhere in the estate, and hand it back.
   * If a second kind of history ever lands, this flag becomes its `type` and the
   * argument is on the record for whoever does it.
   *
   * TAKEN: the field says it, and NOTHING SAYS IT TWICE — the flag names no
   * table, no column and no join. It means "this row's retired references are in
   * `ref_aliases` under this module's own `table`", so the engine asks the same
   * seam the five doors ask, with the module's table and the row it is already
   * looking at. It is `narrow`'s shape one level down: a per-module fact the
   * generic engine cannot infer, DECLARED beside the module and then
   * derived-CHECKED so it cannot be forgotten. R55 reads `TEAM_REF_TABLES` and
   * requires this flag on the `ref` field of every module whose table is a kind's
   * table, and forbids it everywhere else — so `tasks` may not grow one, and a

/** THE OTHER NAMES THE SAME THING GOES BY — derived, never hand-listed.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is worth reading before touching it. On 29 Aug 2026
 * the assistant was asked the owner's own question on staging and failed on the
 * first call: it asked for `describe_module("help")`, this map calls that module
 * `tickets`, and the door refused. That was not the model being stupid — it was
 * the model counting. `list_help_tickets`, `set_help_status`, the API path
 * `/api/content/help`, the permission string on every role's sheet and the MCP
 * tool names ALL say help; CLAUDE.md says so deliberately (the section's LABEL
 * is Tickets, the module, tables, path and tool names stay `help` on purpose).
 * The grammar introduced the ONE place where the label is the name, and the
 * model reasonably followed the other forty signals.
 *
 * So a module answers to the names it already has elsewhere: its PERMISSION
 * module and its TABLE. Both are read off `QUERY_MODULES` itself, so a module
 * added tomorrow brings its own aliases and nobody has to remember. Two rules
 * keep it honest:
 *   · a name that is already a module KEY is never an alias (a key always wins);
 *   · a name claimed by TWO modules is no alias at all — `work` covers stories,
 *     sprints, work logs, tasks and waves, and guessing which one somebody meant
 *     would be worse than saying "which of these?".
 *
 * An alias can only ever resolve to a module that is already in the allow-list,
 * so this widens what a caller may SAY and not one row of what they may READ
 * (asserted in workers/tenancy/test/query-fence.test.ts). */

 * front of a person is not the word the field answers to, and on 29 Aug 2026 a
 * lookup by `reference` was refused for exactly that reason.

 * Small and hand-written, because unlike a module there is no second source to
 * derive a field's other name from — a table and a permission string exist
 * anyway, a synonym does not. Each line is rot-checked: it must resolve to a
 * real field on at least one module, and it must never shadow a field that
 * already exists. A field's own COLUMN is handled separately and needs no line
