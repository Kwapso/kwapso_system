// THE CORE DATABASE'S RETENTION SWEEP — the nightly delete that stops the ONE
// shared database growing forever on rows nothing will ever read again.
//
// The base is careful about GROWTH everywhere it can see it: every list is
// capped, every collection that grows pages, every repeatable write into core
// now carries a per-caller ceiling. None of that is retention. A ceiling bounds
// the RATE; only a sweep bounds the TOTAL — and three tables here are written by
// callers who are not signed in at all (a sign-in code and its ledger row are
// minted for anyone who types an email address), so their total was bounded by
// nothing but the size of the internet's patience.
//
// WHAT IT TAKES, AND WHY EACH IS SAFE TO TAKE:
//   • login_codes  — a code lives ten minutes and the per-address hourly cap
//                    looks back one hour. A day-old row cannot change any answer.
//   • login_sends  — the send budget's whole window is one hour (limits.ts).
//   • sessions     — rows already PAST their own expires_at. The cookie they
//                    describe is already dead: every read re-checks expiry, so
//                    deleting the row signs nobody out who was still signed in.
//
// WHAT IT NEVER TAKES: anything anyone might have to answer for later. Activity,
// account activity, error logs, usage and the audit blocks all stay — "deactivate,
// never delete" is about the RECORD, and a spent sign-in code is not a record.
//
// BOUNDED, LIKE EVERY OTHER PIECE OF UNATTENDED WORK (R14's other axis). A DELETE
// is exactly as unbounded as a SELECT: an estate swept for the first time after a
// year would try to remove millions of rows in one statement, time out, delete
// nothing — and do the same again tomorrow, forever. So each STATEMENT takes at
// most RETENTION_DELETE_CAP rows, chosen by an inner SELECT with its own LIMIT
// (SQLite only accepts LIMIT on DELETE in builds compiled for it; D1's is not
// one).
//
// AND THE TICK RUNS THAT STATEMENT MORE THAN ONCE, which is the part that was
// missing. A cap on the statement is a cap on what can time out; it is not a cap
// on the night, and this sweep used to have only the first. One pass of 5,000 rows
// a night against a shared database taking sign-ins from every tenant is not
// retention — a quarter-million-person tenant produces more sign-in artefacts
// before lunch than a night could remove, and the tables grew monotonically while
// a green nightly job reported success. Now each table gets up to
// RETENTION_PASSES_PER_TICK bounded statements and stops the moment one comes back
// short, so "catching up takes a few nights and always finishes" is a property of
// the code rather than a hope about volume.
//
// WHAT IT NOW ALSO TAKES: `error_logs`, past ERROR_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS — the window
// db/core/0012 has claimed since the table was created and nothing had ever
// enforced. Diagnostics, not a record: the audit tables above stay untouched.
