// through Excel/Numbers and back through the CSV importer. Rows end CRLF and the
// file opens with a UTF-8 BOM (Excel mis-decodes accents without it).
// Export is READ-gated at the route (the cross-cutting rule: export needs READ,
// import needs CREATE) and always built from the caller's OWN team database.

 * R14 caps every read, and a cap is an honest refusal to answer — but a CSV
 * download is not a page, it is the file, and half a file is the one answer
 * nobody can act on. Worse here than anywhere: every export's columns LEAD WITH
 * THE IMPORT FORMAT so the file goes straight back in through the importer, and
 * a silently-truncated export re-imported is data loss wearing a round trip's
 * clothes. The roles export made that literal — a role whose permission rows fell
 * off the end of a capped read renders as an all-off matrix, so the short file
 * did not merely omit roles, it REVOKED them on the way back in.
 *
 * So every export reader hands back `complete` alongside its rows, and its door
 * refuses rather than serving a short file that looks whole. ONE sentence for all
 * four doors, because a refusal that exists four times is a refusal three of them
 * can drift out of: `noun` names the collection, `narrow` says how to ask for
 * less. */
