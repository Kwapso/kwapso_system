// Activity log (locked rule: log EVERYTHING — creations, edits, activations,
// deactivations, joins, invites, import stages, milestones). One reusable writer
// every module calls; rows live in each team's own `activity` table and point at
// the changed row by a generic (related_table, related_row_id) pair.
//
// A ROW ANSWERS THREE QUESTIONS: who did it (the frozen actor snapshot), what it
// was about (the pair above) and WHERE IT CAME FROM (`origin`) — plus WHAT KIND
// of event it was (`verb`), so history is filterable rather than only readable.
// Both of the last two are DERIVED here rather than passed in: the verb from the
// sentence the caller already writes (activity-verbs.ts), the origin from the
// data-door config the caller already holds (origin.ts). See team migration 0062
// and DATA-MODEL § activity.
//
// APPEND-ONLY. Nothing updates or deletes a row, the nightly retention sweep
// excludes the table by name, and `insertActivity` below is the one way in from
// outside a migration. workers/tenancy/test/activity-trail.test.ts asserts all
// three; the per-worker activity-seam suites assert that every mutation writes
// one, or says in writing why it does not.

/** Write one activity row into a team's own database. Best-effort by contract:

 * Right for every caller so far: each one logs a SIDE EFFECT of a mutation that
 * already succeeded ("member role changed"), so losing the log line is an
 * acceptable, silent loss. See `writeActivity` below for the caller it is wrong
 * for.
 *
 * SWALLOWED IS NOT THE SAME AS UNRECORDED, and for a year it was. The console
 * line above was the whole of it, which meant a team database having a bad
 * minute left a HOLE in the one table R18's entire audit story rests on, and the
 * only trace expired with the log tail. The action succeeded, the feed is
 * missing a line, and nobody can tell the difference between "nothing happened"
 * and "we failed to write that it did".
 *
 * So the swallow stays — the contract is right and this must never break the
 * action it describes — and the loss is now DURABLE: `logError` cannot throw
 * (error-log.ts's own contract), so recording here costs the caller nothing it
 * was not already paying. `cfg.core` is absent only where nobody wired one, and
