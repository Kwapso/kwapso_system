# Kwapso

**Kwapso's own operating system.** Two front doors over one shared foundation:

- **The agency app** (`web/`) is where Kwapso's staff work — ticket triage,
  stories and sprints, one-click timers, process maps and their savings math,
  money and margins, the knowledge base, and an in-app AI agent at their side.
- **The client portal** (`web-portal/`) is for Kwapso's customers, the companies
  the agency serves — where they see the impact created for them, raise and
  track tickets, follow sprint status, get to-dos, browse their files, and, once
  the team trusts it, ask the knowledge base a question.

**Staff use the system; customers use the portal.** That is the whole shape.

Everyone who signs in holds a **role**, and the role decides which door they
belong at. Staff hold a staff role (Admin, Ops, …). A customer's people hold
the **Client** role and are tied to one of the agency's **accounts** — the
customer spine (`accounts` + `account_links` + `portal_users`) — which fences
them to their own company's records and sends them to the portal. This is built
for Kwapso and Kwapso's own customers; it is not a product sold to other
companies.

**Eight workers are on disk** (a count `web/test/doc-claims.test.ts` checks
against `workers/` itself, so it cannot quietly rot): six private brains —
**auth**; **tenancy** (the customer spine — accounts, contact links, portal
logins; staff roles and invites; the screen-recipe store; process maps; and the
money, the three rate cards + margin); **realtime**; **content** (tickets and
the work engine, the knowledge base); **data-ops** (import + the AI agent); and
**mcp** — behind **two public front doors**: `gateway` (the agency app, `web/`)
and `portal-gateway` (the client portal, `web-portal/`). Every other worker
sets `workers_dev:false`, so no public route can reach `/internal/*`, the agent,
or the act-as-user surface.

The **mcp** worker is the external machine surface: personal access tokens
(hashed, shown-once, revocable; managed under Settings → Access tokens) bridged
to short-lived sessions that expose the same gated doors as MCP tools at
`/mcp` — an outside tool acts *as* a real person, capped by their live role.

The **AI agent** acts as the signed-in user through those same gated endpoints
and never exceeds their rights. Its model is swappable but never silent: a
Workers AI model named by `AGENT_MODEL`, and with no key there is no assistant
at all rather than a quietly weaker one. It confirms on destructive and bulk
actions, and is metered by a daily allowance (the `AGENT_FREE_DAILY` var: code
default 25, both environments ship **50**, and staging's `AGENT_NO_DAILY_CAP`
props the refusal door open so the 50 is enforced on production only —
OPERATIONS.md has both vars) plus a purchasable balance.

One piece of plumbing you will meet in the code: the permission spine is scoped
by a team id — `shared/workers/gating.ts` resolves rights from `(teamId,
userId)`, and the agency app's deep-link URLs are `/t/<teamId>/<module>/<id>`.
Nobody at either front door ever sees it: the team switcher and the teams list
are hidden and team creation is closed, both from `shared/product.ts`.

**It is HIDDEN, not scheduled for removal, and that is a locked decision.** The
owner has overruled removal three times, most recently on 3 September 2026, and
`shared/product.ts` carries the ruling with its measurements attached so a
fourth proposal starts from facts rather than re-deriving them. The reason is
that the multi-team plumbing is not a feature kwapso uses, it is the thing that
gets FORKED for a paying client (BASE-MANUAL.md §5). Two things make this more
than a preference: `web/test/rules.test.ts` goes red if somebody finishes the
removal, and `teams.database_id` is also the ownership oracle
`ourDatabases` filters by — this deployment shares a Cloudflare account with
other companies, so taking the table away without replacing that filter first
leaves a fallback between the nightly size cron and another company's
production database. Read `shared/product.ts` before proposing it again.

Staff manage the roster — Overview, Members, Member roles, Invites — rendered
by the screen engine rather than living under Settings. A customer's portal
login is granted separately, through the accounts flow, never through Invites.

*This section says what is true now.* When each piece landed is in
[BASE-IMPROVEMENTS.md](documents/BASE-IMPROVEMENTS.md) § *When each piece landed*: dated
stamps used to accumulate here, in the first thing every reader and every agent
opens, which is the one place current state should not have to be sifted out of
history.

The agency app and the client portal each have their own address:

| Surface | Production | Staging |
|---|---|---|
| Agency app | https://agency.kwapso.app | https://agency-staging.kwapso.app |
| Client portal | https://client.kwapso.app | https://staging-client.kwapso.app |

(`portal.kwapso.app` is **not** ours, it is the owner's live Glide portal, untouched
until cutover.)

## The documents

**Where they live.** Four documents sit at the repository root because they are opened
by NAME rather than found through this map: this file, [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) (what an
agent reads first), [RULES.md](RULES.md) (the law-book, which `web/test/rules.test.ts`
reads off disk beside `shared/rules/registry.ts`), and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (the
cross-tool filename a tool opens out of habit). **Every other document is in
[`documents/`](documents/)** — forty-two of them, moved there on 2026-09-06 because a
root holding forty-six documents is a root nobody can see the code in. Nothing was
renamed and nothing was dropped; `git log --follow` still reaches every one of them.

**Making your FIRST change?** [CONTRIBUTING.md](documents/CONTRIBUTING.md) is the path
through all of this once, in the order the work happens: clone → the planning
ritual → where the change goes → `npm run check` → the commit convention → ship.
Start there, then come back to this map when you need a specific document.

**New here, developer or agent? Read in this order:** [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) (the
rules) → [BASE-MANUAL.md](documents/BASE-MANUAL.md) (how the base works and *why*, incl. how to
**fork it for a new product** and **how each part scales**) →
[ARCHITECTURE.md](documents/ARCHITECTURE.md) (the locked decisions) →
[BUILD-A-MODULE.md](documents/BUILD-A-MODULE.md) (add a module end to end) →
[CONVENTIONS.md](documents/CONVENTIONS.md) + [UI-CONVENTIONS.md](documents/UI-CONVENTIONS.md) (how code
and screens are written) → the reference docs below as you need them →
[EDGE-CASES.md](documents/EDGE-CASES.md) before touching anything subtle →
[OPERATIONS.md](documents/OPERATIONS.md) to ship.

**Already here, and just need to make ONE change?** That order is the whole tour.
This is the short way in, the minimum that keeps a change in-rule, by the kind of
change it is. CLAUDE.md is on every row because the Laws are, and the planning
ritual in it names the rest:

| You are changing… | Read these, then build |
|---|---|
| a screen or a form | [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) → [UI-CONVENTIONS.md](documents/UI-CONVENTIONS.md) → [CACHING.md](documents/CACHING.md) → [LANGUAGES.md](documents/LANGUAGES.md) if it says a single word to a person |
| a worker route | [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) → [CONVENTIONS.md](documents/CONVENTIONS.md) → [DATA-MODEL.md](documents/DATA-MODEL.md) |
| a whole new module | [BUILD-A-MODULE.md](documents/BUILD-A-MODULE.md) (it lists its own prerequisites) |
| anything the agent or MCP can reach | [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) → [MCP.md](documents/MCP.md) → [AGENTIC-IMPORT.md](documents/AGENTIC-IMPORT.md) |
| a table, a column, or a migration | [DATA-MODEL.md](documents/DATA-MODEL.md) → [OPERATIONS.md](documents/OPERATIONS.md) |
| a Law, or anything a Law names | [RULES.md](RULES.md) + `shared/rules/registry.ts` + its check, all three, or the build fails |
| anything that spends money — a model call, an email, a cron, a stored file | [COSTS.md](documents/COSTS.md) → `shared/workers/pricing.ts` |

Whatever the row, [EDGE-CASES.md](documents/EDGE-CASES.md) is the one to open when something
behaves oddly rather than wrongly, it is where the non-obvious traps are written
down, and most of them cost somebody a day before they got there.

### One topic, one owner

Several documents legitimately touch the same subject at different **altitudes**.
ARCHITECTURE rules on it, BASE-MANUAL explains why it is that way, CONVENTIONS
tells you how to write it, and the data layer is a good example of all three
getting along. What is *not* legitimate is two documents describing the same
MECHANISM step by step, because then they can disagree and nothing says which is
right. This table names the owner for the topics where that has actually happened:

| Topic | Owner, the mechanism lives here | Everyone else |
|---|---|---|
| Which workers exist, what each owns and why | [BASE-MANUAL.md §1](documents/BASE-MANUAL.md) | ARCHITECTURE §2 keeps the *decision* (split by domain, exactly two public doors); OPERATIONS keeps the bindings, crons and hostnames |
| `teamContext` → `requireRight`, step by step | [CONVENTIONS.md §4](documents/CONVENTIONS.md) | BASE-MANUAL §2 keeps *why* the spine is shaped that way (the tall sheet, the module list) |
| Worker vs DO class vs DO instance | [DURABLE-OBJECTS.md §1](documents/DURABLE-OBJECTS.md) | ARCHITECTURE §2 keeps the ruling on what gets an instance |
| Every table and column | [DATA-MODEL.md](documents/DATA-MODEL.md) | everyone links to it; nobody re-lists columns |
| The Laws themselves | [RULES.md](RULES.md) + `shared/rules/registry.ts` | CLAUDE.md summarises them; BASE-MANUAL §4 explains the safety net |
| How a sentence gets translated | [LANGUAGES.md](documents/LANGUAGES.md) | RULES.md keeps the four Laws (R28, R33, R34, R44); CONTRIBUTING §3 keeps the commit workflow; UI-CONVENTIONS points here rather than restating it |

**And a number in prose is a number nothing checks.** ARCHITECTURE described the
portal's allow-list as "fourteen named doors" long after it had grown to
twenty-four, and the same stale figure sat in `web-portal/lib/api.ts`, two copies,
neither of which anybody thought to correct. Where a count is derivable, point at
the thing that holds it (`PORTAL_DOORS` in the portal gateway) instead of writing
it down. The counts that *are* written down, the worker roster, the `R1–Rn` range,
are the ones `web/test/doc-claims.test.ts` checks against the code, which is why
they may be written down at all.

**Rebuilding the whole base from nothing?** Follow
**[BOOTSTRAP.md](documents/BOOTSTRAP.md)**, the day-zero, command-by-command runbook that takes
a fresh Cloudflare account to a live staging + production Kwapso System. It is the concrete
answer to "with only these docs and the repo, could I recreate the base?", yes: run
that list. For the **one-command** version, the `new-app` build skill lives in the operator's
global skills (`~/.claude/skills/new-app/` — deliberately not vendored here, so a
fork does not carry its own factory): tell Claude Code "new app" and it stands up
a fresh, branded, deployed fork automatically. If that skill is missing on this
machine, BOOTSTRAP.md is the same journey by hand.

**The rulebook, what governs the base (read before you change it).** Every rule for
modifying, recreating, or building on the Kwapso System lives in one of these, and each is
concrete + checkable:

- **The global habits every Kwapso build follows**, [SWIFT-STRUCK-WAY.md](documents/SWIFT-STRUCK-WAY.md): the cross-app rules (lean, machine-checked laws, act-as-user, every route gates, deactivate-not-delete, the ship pipeline). Travels with every fork; the `new-app` skill reads it first.
- **The two prime directives** (stay lean; obey the Laws), [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), the entry point.
- **The Laws of the Base** (R1–R54), [RULES.md](RULES.md), *machine-checked*: pinned to `shared/rules/registry.ts` and enforced by tests that read the source off disk (`web/test/rules.test.ts`, the per-worker `publish-seam.test.ts` for live-sync R1, the `gating-seam` suites, incl. the external mcp surface, for R10, `fetch-timeout` R11, `cron-records` R12, plus the scale/safety round: R13 self-healing catalog, R14 bounded lists, R15 live listeners, R16 exact counts, R17 idempotent transitions, R18 cross-module activity gating, R19 agent/MCP filter parity, R20 scanned boundary validation, R21 no agency door for a client login, R22 agent/MCP body-field parity, R26 the vector index narrows and the team's database decides, R27 described contracts, every backticked identifier in a tool description names something real, R28 the translation catalogue is exactly the set of strings the app says: a sentence missing from it ships untranslated, and an entry nothing says any more is an orphan, R29 the page has one width per front door and a screen never sets its own, R38 a record detail reads its record BY ID and never finds it in a page of a growing collection, R40 a stored file must reach a person: every door that puts bytes in a bucket is walked through to the screen that renders the reference, and a field that only ever reaches a form is not a read, R41 a file somebody picked is either sent or refused and never dropped: every create call site of a dialog that defers an upload must hand back the id its files hang on, R42 every accepted source type resolves to a declared reader on EVERY door or to an honest refusal, and no door chooses its own: one table both the upload door and the Drive lane ask, so the same PDF cannot read properly through one and come out as gibberish through the other, R43 agent/MCP tool-SET parity: a tool that exists on the agent's own catalog exists on MCP's too, or the gap is a named, reasoned line, and the reverse — R19/R22 prove a door has a tool on some surface, this proves the two surfaces agree with each other, R45 every kit composition is decided: all 47 files under `shared/ui/compositions/` are either a direct import this app actually reaches or a reasoned, rot-checked exemption naming why not — a composition nobody looked at, or hand-rolled screen UI that duplicates one, is the only unacceptable result, R46 every kit component and foundation is decided too: every component under `components/` plus the 3 foundations (icons, tokens, motion) — the count is derived by `kitInventory()` in `scripts/kit-coverage.mjs` and deliberately not written down here — is either REACHED — a direct import, or through another adopted part, or through a CSS `@import` a JS-only census cannot see — or a reasoned, rot-checked exemption). Break one → the build goes red. Adding a Law requires the rule, the registry entry, and a check, all three.  **And the check must be able to fail:** every source-scan strips comments before matching (this repo's comments discuss the very seams being scanned), matches a CALL not a word, boundaries each identifier, knows both export shapes, and carries a tripwire asserting it matched something. See CONVENTIONS.md § *Reading config, and writing a check that can fail*, each of those rules was earned by a check that passed its own sabotage.
- **Code house style**, [CONVENTIONS.md](documents/CONVENTIONS.md): the handler shape, the two data doors, gating, boundary validation, deactivate-not-delete, the comment style.
- **UI conventions**, [UI-CONVENTIONS.md](documents/UI-CONVENTIONS.md): library-is-lego, recipe vs bespoke, the enforced UI Laws, the action-icon mapping, the *action-button rows never clip* responsive rule, the voice.
- **How a screen is arranged**, [UI-RULEBOOK.md](documents/UI-RULEBOOK.md): the layer above UI-CONVENTIONS. A *rearrangement* rule book, expressible with the components `shared/ui/` already ships and the tokens the theme already defines, so every rule in it can be applied from `web/`, `web-portal/` and `shared/` without changing a component.
- **What was asked for, and where each item stands**, [CHECKLIST.md](documents/CHECKLIST.md): every request from the feedback round, with a status word beside it and, where something is not being done, the reason.
- **Import + export rules**, [AGENTIC-IMPORT.md](documents/AGENTIC-IMPORT.md): audit parity, export-needs-read/import-needs-create, one-confirm, insert-only, and every import place offers a sample file (test-enforced).
- **Error rules**, [ERROR-HANDLING.md](documents/ERROR-HANDLING.md): never swallow; one client seam; every worker records to the central store.
- **The bad day**, [RESILIENCE.md](documents/RESILIENCE.md): auth named as the single point of failure and what falls over with it, which worker owns a table a pair of them write, and how the rows come back (backup, restore, and what is deliberately not backed up).
- **The single vocabulary**, `shared/glossary.ts` (Law R6, machine-checked): one word per concept, used in all UI copy.

- **The docs themselves are checked too**, `web/test/doc-claims.test.ts` derives the worker roster from `workers/` on disk, reads each `wrangler.jsonc` to see which are public, and reads the Laws' range off `shared/rules/registry.ts`, then fails if any doc (the root canon, the fork skills, or a `.plans/` build plan) states a worker count, a public-door count or a `R1–Rn` range that disagrees. Add a worker or a Law, and every stale sentence goes red the same day.

If a rule isn't machine-checked (e.g. a responsive-CSS convention), the doc says so and names where it's applied.

> **The completeness bar this doc set is held to:** a non-technical owner, an AI agent,
> or a new developer, armed with *only* the repository and these documents, can (1)

0. **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)**. Read first if you're an agent (or a new
   developer): the **Laws of the Base** (machine-enforced rules), the build
   style, and this doc map. **[RULES.md](RULES.md)** is the law-book it enforces
   (pinned to `shared/rules/registry.ts`, checked by `web/test/rules.test.ts`).
   **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** is the cross-tool convention filename, one
   paragraph pointing here, so an agent that opens it by habit lands in the same
   place. It exists to have exactly that content and no more; anything it
   restated would be a second copy of the rules, drifting.
1. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](documents/ARCHITECTURE.md)**, the locked decisions (incl. the
   workers, the live layer, and the Durable Object code-vs-runtime model). Read
   before building anything; do not relitigate without the user.
2. **[OPERATIONS.md](documents/OPERATIONS.md)**, how it builds and ships.
   **[RUNBOOK.md](documents/RUNBOOK.md)** is the other direction: rolling a change back out
   (with the named triggers that say when to roll back rather than fix forward),
   getting data back with D1 Time Travel, and what to check when it breaks at two
   in the morning. **[INVENTORY.md](documents/INVENTORY.md)** is everything the app needs
   that is *not* in this repository, the accounts, the domains, the two Google
   OAuth clients, every credential by name, the cron jobs, and an honest list of
   what has no backup. **[CHANGELOG.md](documents/CHANGELOG.md)** is the eras this project
   moved through, reconstructed from git history so a newcomer can read how it got
   here without reading 350 commits.
3. **[CACHING.md](documents/CACHING.md)**, the system-wide caching + loading/feedback
   ruleset (cache-first, row-level live-sync, patch the changed row, never
   refetch the list, examples). Follow it for every screen/module.
4. **[CONCURRENCY.md](documents/CONCURRENCY.md)**, the race-safety ruleset (atomic writes,
   unique indexes, when a Durable Object is the lock). Follow it for any write
   that protects an invariant (counts, balances, uniqueness).
5. **[ERROR-HANDLING.md](documents/ERROR-HANDLING.md)**, the error-capture ruleset (the
   one swappable logging seam, the error boundary, never-swallow).
   **[COSTS.md](documents/COSTS.md)** is the other half of the same question: every surface
   that bills, what one signup, one import, one assistant reply and one knowledge
   question actually cost with the arithmetic shown, what the crons and the
   stored files cost, and what still is not measured. Every price carries the
   page it was read from and the day it was read, and the numbers themselves are
   data in `shared/workers/pricing.ts`, so the code, the scripts and the prose
   cannot drift apart. Two commands reproduce its headline figures without
   spending anything: `node scripts/measure-preamble.mjs` and
   `node --experimental-transform-types scripts/ai-spend.mjs`.
6. **[ROADMAP.md](documents/ROADMAP.md)**, **history, not a plan.** The build record of ONE
   round (Phase C: members, roles & settings), closed 2026-07-02, with the
   type/endpoint contracts each of its phases plugged into. Kept so its decisions
   aren't re-argued; it does not describe the eras that shipped after it.
   **[RESKIN-REPORT.md](documents/RESKIN-REPORT.md)** is history of the same kind, one era
   later: the record of vendoring the component library into `shared/ui/` and
   re-theming both front doors to the kwapso design kit (2026-08-22). Read it for
   why a decision was made — the four token collisions, the four kit gaps decided
   on the designer's behalf, and the one law exemption that was written and
   deleted on the same day. There is
   deliberately no single "what's next" file. Open work lives beside the thing
   it's open on: **UI-GAPS.md** (library gaps), **EDGE-CASES.md** (the deferred
   perf wins), **AGENT-MODULES-PLAN.md** (the deferred agent hooks),
   **[ADVISORIES.md](documents/ADVISORIES.md)** (every dependency advisory, and the proof
   of whether the code we deploy can reach it), and **BASE-IMPROVEMENTS.md**
   (what each audit round changed). For what is true today: this file →
   BASE-MANUAL.md.
7. **[SEARCH.md](documents/SEARCH.md)**, the search + in-app-filter ruleset (the layered
   client-side → server `?q=` → per-team FTS5 model; recipe-declared).
8. **[DATA-MODEL.md](documents/DATA-MODEL.md)**, every table (global core + per-team), what's
   built vs. to build, and the cross-cutting model resolutions.
9. **[SCREEN-ENGINE-PLAN.md](documents/SCREEN-ENGINE-PLAN.md)**, the screen-recipe engine and
   the `/t/<teamId>/<module>/<id>` deep-link grammar the team area runs on.
    **[CONTROL-SWAP-LANES.md](documents/CONTROL-SWAP-LANES.md)** is the other transient
    one: the 93 hand-written HTML controls split into **three** non-colliding
    lanes — the document's own § *There is no lane D* shows why the portal's
    share is one conversion rather than a fourth lane — with the ruling on which
    raw elements are legitimately raw (a hidden file input is a mechanism, not a
    control; a `<form>` is correct HTML) so three parallel sessions reach the
    same answer instead of three different ones. Delete it when the lanes have
    landed: raw `<button|input|select|textarea>` across `web/`, `web-portal/`
    and `shared/web/` is down to 15 from 93, so the delete condition is close.

    **[LAW-RECONCILIATION.md](documents/LAW-RECONCILIATION.md)** sits beside them and is a
    PROPOSAL rather than a record: the base's seventeen UI laws read against the
    kit's own rulebook, after the owner ruled on 2026-08-27 that the kit is
    canon. Its finding is that fourteen of them have no kit counterpart at all —
    they are product and correctness rules a design kit has no view on — and
    that nothing in the list deserves deleting. Delete the file once its three
    proposed edits have landed and its marks are in.

10. **[UI-GAPS.md](documents/UI-GAPS.md)**, the running list of things the component library
    still cannot do (a gap is fixed in the library, once, not worked around on
    each screen that hits it). Its twin pointing the other way is
    **[NEEDS-A-SPEC.md](documents/NEEDS-A-SPEC.md)**: what the app RENDERS that the design
    kit does not yet draw, written for the designer rather than for us. UI-GAPS
    is work we owe the library; NEEDS-A-SPEC is work the kit owes the app, and
    everything on it is wearing the new tokens with its old shape untouched,
    because the kit's own rule is to log rather than improvise.
    **[KIT-COVERAGE.md](documents/KIT-COVERAGE.md)** answers the question those two do
    not: of the parts the kit already ships and the app already has, how many
    has it actually adopted. The owner narrated the whole catalogue and it was
    reconciled against the parts on disk, so every item maps in both
    directions. Regenerate its ticks with `node scripts/kit-coverage.mjs`;
    never edit them by hand. Its companion,
    **[COMPOSITION-MISMATCHES.md](documents/COMPOSITION-MISMATCHES.md)**, is the other
    half of that number: every kit composition checked and found NOT to fit,
    with the specific structural reason for each — so a locked mismatch is a
    recorded result nobody re-discovers by trying it again, rather than a
    silent gap that reads like nobody looked.
11. The UI comes ONLY from the component library, which is vendored **in this
    repo** at `shared/ui/` and imported as `@shared/ui/…` — and it is a PINNED
    dependency: `github.com/Kwapso/kwapso-ui-ux` at the tag in `shared/ui/VERSION.json`,
    pulled by `scripts/sync-design.mjs`. A hand-edit under `shared/ui/` turns the
    build red (`web/test/vendored-kit.test.ts` recomputes the content hash), so a
    kit change is made upstream in `Kwapso/kwapso-ui-ux`, tagged, and pulled. (It was
    the npm package `@kwapso/ui` until 2026-08-22, then an editable copy for three
    days, then pinned on 2026-08-25.) Missing a component? Close the gap upstream —
    never one-off UI in `web/`, and never a hand-build under `shared/ui/`;
    `shared/ui/README.md` has the whole rationale.

### The manual, build on it, understand it, rebuild it from zero

12. **[BASE-MANUAL.md](documents/BASE-MANUAL.md)**, how the whole base works AND *why*: the
    eight workers, the two-tier database, the permission spine, how a new module and
    the base influence each other, and how to change foundational code + how a
    change ripples. Start here to understand the system.
13. **[BUILD-A-MODULE.md](documents/BUILD-A-MODULE.md)**, the golden-path checklist to add a
    team module end to end (table → permissions → worker → web → detail → tests),
    worked through a real module.
14. **[CONVENTIONS.md](documents/CONVENTIONS.md)**, the code + comment house style (the
    handler shape, the data doors, gating, validation, deactivate-not-delete, the
    comment convention, how `npm run check` gates everything).
15. **[UI-CONVENTIONS.md](documents/UI-CONVENTIONS.md)**, how screens are built: the
    library-is-lego rule, recipe vs. bespoke, the enforced UI Laws, the
    action-icon mapping, and the voice.
    **[LANGUAGES.md](documents/LANGUAGES.md)** is its sibling and the OWNER of the
    translation capability: the four languages the app speaks, the one shared
    definition of what a person reads, `npm run lang`, the three shapes that go
    wrong (`t("of")` is the classic), and the ceiling that can only fall. Four
    Laws govern translation and the mechanism used to be explained only inside
    the law-book, which is the wrong altitude for a mechanism — so a developer
    adding a screen walked past every document that would have told them a new
    sentence must be wrapped and catalogued.
16. **[DURABLE-OBJECTS.md](documents/DURABLE-OBJECTS.md)**, the realtime Durable Object
    (`TeamChannel`), the code-vs-runtime model, and when a DO is the lock vs. plain
    atomic D1.
17. **[EDGE-CASES.md](documents/EDGE-CASES.md)**, the non-obvious traps a maintainer must
    know (the static-export reload, the list-cache-as-detail-source, the REST-door
    round-trips, the confirm model, streaming, and more).
18. **[AGENTIC-IMPORT.md](documents/AGENTIC-IMPORT.md)**, the agent-driven, multi-table data
    import: dump old-system CSV exports, the agent normalizes + maps + orders
    interdependent tables + resolves foreign keys + rejects honestly, writing every
    row through the gated door (audit parity). How an app declares an import target
    + references. Read before building an import for a new module.
19. **[BOOTSTRAP.md](documents/BOOTSTRAP.md)**, the day-zero, command-by-command runbook to
    rebuild the whole base from a fresh Cloudflare account (also linked at the top).
20. **[MCP.md](documents/MCP.md)**, the machine door: how an outside developer/tool connects to
    the base over MCP (get a token → `Bearer` on `/mcp`), the tool catalogue, and the
    cost model (reads/exports/imports are free endpoint hits; only the assistant tools
    draw the team's AI quota — scope the role to control it).
21. **[PLATFORMS.md](documents/PLATFORMS.md)**, where the base can run. **Cloudflare is
    recommended** (and `new-app` stands it up turnkey); this maps the base's five seams
    (per-team data · live layer · compute · storage · static web) onto eight other cloud
    providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, Supabase, Fly.io, Render, DigitalOcean, Netlify)
    with an honest effort rating and the porting method (swap ~4 seam files, not the app).
22. **[mcp-quickstart.md](documents/mcp-quickstart.md)**, the one-page version of MCP.md, meant
    to be handed straight to an outside developer. Deliberately a short overlap with
    MCP.md, not a second source: MCP.md is the full detail, this is the page you send.
23. **[SCOPE.html](documents/SCOPE.html)**, the product's scope of work: what kwapso is for,
    chapter by chapter. The other docs defer to it by chapter ("SCOPE ch.06") for
    product decisions — the account fence, the two front doors, what the client may
    see — so when a rule here says "because SCOPE says so", this is the book it means.
    Open it in a browser.
24. **[kwapso-the-system-explained.html](documents/kwapso-the-system-explained.html)**, the
    owner-facing walkthrough of the whole system in plain language. A companion to
    SCOPE, not a rule source.
25. **[glide/README.md](glide/README.md)**, the legacy Glide catalogue: the two apps
    kwapso ran on before this one, how to pull their rows, and the field
    reconciliation. `glide/data/` is git-ignored — it is customer data.
26. **`planning-answers/`**, the answered briefing forms behind SCOPE.html, one JSON
    file per round per respondent (`plan_with_questions` exports). Rounds 1–2 settled
    the shape of the system; round 3 was answered independently by three people
    (Alaap K, Alex, Aurora) so agreement could be told apart from misunderstanding;
    round 4 closed the open questions. **Tracked on purpose, and not to be deleted or
    edited:** SCOPE ch.13 states that every decision in it traces back here, so these
    files are the evidence for "we decided this, and here is who said so". They are a
    RECORD, never a spec — where a form answer and SCOPE.html disagree, SCOPE wins,
    and where SCOPE is silent, base law applies. They hold no customer data.
27. **`scaling-review.md`** — **NOT IN THIS REPOSITORY. Do not go looking for it.**
    It was the scaling audit of 14 Aug 2026 (the twelve-dimension score, the platform
    limits looked up live, what breaks first and at what size, the twelve repairs that
    landed and the eleven items judged too risky to change), and it was deleted on
    29 Aug 2026 in `f17f5501`. It is listed here because two documents still cite it
    and a reader deserves to know why the citation does not open.

    **The DECISION it produced is [ARCHITECTURE.md §7](documents/ARCHITECTURE.md) — 78 accepted,
    LOCKED — and that section is self-sufficient**: the live layer as the first
    ceiling, at roughly 3,000–5,000 concurrent sockets in one team, is written there,
    not only here. Cite §7. Two notes for anyone tidying this up: `.gitignore` still
    carries a comment claiming this file is deliberately tracked (it is not tracked and
    it is not present — both halves are stale), and `DATA-MODEL.md` cites it once for
    R16's price. Either restore the report or re-point both at §7; leaving it as a name
    with nothing behind it is the state this entry exists to warn about.

### Where the code lives

| Folder | What it is |
|---|---|
| `documents/` | the canon — every document except the four opened by name (this file, CLAUDE.md, RULES.md, AGENTS.md). `web/test/doc-claims.test.ts` walks root AND here, and asserts the walk found more than thirty, so a canon that quietly empties fails instead of passing |
| `web/` | the AGENCY screens (Next.js static export → `web/out`, served by `workers/gateway`) |
| `web-portal/` | the CLIENT PORTAL screens (static export → `web-portal/out`, served by `workers/portal-gateway`). Its own workspace, its own tests, including the account-fence suite |
| `workers/` | the eight workers. Six private brains + the two public gateways |
| `shared/` | what every side agrees on. `shared/workers/`, the worker seams (gating, the data door, validation, publish); `shared/web/`, the front-end seams BOTH apps import (the cache `store.ts`, the live client `realtime.ts`, `log.ts`, `form-shell.tsx`, `format-count.ts`, `use-form-draft.ts`); plus the types, the glossary and the rules registry. A file lands in `shared/web/` the moment the second front end needs it, that is why several seams the docs used to place under `web/lib/` now live here |
| `db/core/` | the global core database's migrations (per-team schema lives in `workers/tenancy/src/team-schema.ts`) |
| `scripts/` | the operational scripts, reset, seed, the smokes, the Glide pull |
| `tools/` | developer tools that are never deployed and sit outside both front doors' import closure. `tools/screen-builder/` is a Glide-like sandbox that assembles kit parts with the options the kit's own source declares and nothing else (its README has the rule and the one command that rebuilds it) |
| `skills/` | the build skills that travel with the base (`new-app`) |
| `planning-answers/` | the answered briefing forms SCOPE.html traces its decisions to (see #26). A record, not a spec |

## Develop

**You need:** **Node 22** (pinned in `.nvmrc` and `package.json` `engines`, it is
what CI runs), npm 10+, and git. Nothing else, and no cloud account: the commands
below run entirely on your machine. Deploying is a different list. BOOTSTRAP.md
§ 0 has it, and INVENTORY.md names every account and credential involved.

```bash
npm install        # every dependency from npm; the UI library came with the clone, in shared/ui
npm run dev        # the agency app on http://localhost:3000
npm run dev:portal # the client portal on http://localhost:3001
npm run lint       # the fast half of the gate — oxlint over every workspace (~15ms)
npm run check      # THE GATE — lint, then types across every workspace, then the full test suite
```

`npm run check` is what you run before any commit. It lints, then type-checks both front
ends and all eight workers, then runs every test, including the law checks that read the
source off disk, a plain `npx tsc --noEmit` proves far less.

**What green looks like:** **exit code 0**, ten workspaces, every suite passing.
For scale, that is roughly 315 test files and 4,000-odd tests; don't compare
against those figures, compare against exit 0, because the suite grows every week.
**Read the run by its exit code, never by grepping the log** — a suite that fails
to LOAD prints nothing that looks like a failure.

**Two things skip on a fresh clone, and both are correct.** Anything else that
skips is not, investigate it.

1. **`workers/content/test/knowledge-backfill.test.ts`** (one file, three tests)
   measures the knowledge base over the agency's real Glide history, and that
   data is git-ignored customer material (INVENTORY.md § 6). It is absent from
   every clone, so the content worker ends `Test Files 70 passed | 1 skipped`,
   `Tests 933 passed | 3 skipped`. It is the only whole FILE that skips.
2. **`web/test/splash.test.ts`** holds eight `it.skipIf(!REQUIRED)` rows that
   compare the two front doors against their built static export. `npm run check`
   does not build, so they skip and the web workspace ends `Tests 849 passed |
   8 skipped`. `npm run check:built` builds first, sets `REQUIRE_EXPORT=1`, and
   runs them for real.

The exact count for the commit you are standing on:

```bash
npm run check 2>&1 | grep -E "Test Files|Tests "
```

Set a worker up for local dev by copying its `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars`
(gitignored), every worker that takes a secret has one, and each names what
breaks when a value is missing.

Ship by saying **"ship to staging"** / **"ship to production"**, the skills
read OPERATIONS.md and handle GitHub + Cloudflare. To take a change back out
again, or to work out what is wrong while it is live, read
[RUNBOOK.md](documents/RUNBOOK.md).
